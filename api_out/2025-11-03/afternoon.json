We counted at least 18 inaccurate assertions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told his usual lie that the free and fair 2020 election was stolen from him. He lied again that grocery prices “are down” even after CBS’ Norah O’Donnell informed him  they are up . He declared once more that there is now “no inflation,” though there certainly is, and then that inflation is 2% or “even less than 2%,” though the most recent available Consumer Price Index figure  is now up to 3% .\n \n\n   \n  The president also deployed multiple other fictional numbers during his exchanges with O’Donnell, which were recorded Friday and released by CBS on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump made a variety of additional false claims on several subjects, including the government shutdown, the artificial intelligence boom, tariffs, his first impeachment and his former legal battle with “60 Minutes” itself.\n \n\n   \n  CBS posted a  full transcript  of the interview, which O’Donnell  said  ran for nearly 90 minutes, and a nearly 73-minute  video ; it aired  about 28 minutes  on television.\n \n\n   \n  Here is a more detailed breakdown of Trump’s claims.\n \n\n   \n    The economy\n \n\n   \n   Grocery prices \n \n\n   \n  When O’Donnell noted that Americans have “seen their grocery prices go up,” Trump repeated his regular false claim that grocery prices are actually declining: “No, you’re wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they’re going down. Other than beef, which we’re working on, which we can solve very quickly.” Trump repeated later in the interview, “Our groceries are down.”\n \n\n   \n   Grocery prices are up  under Trump — and while there has been a particularly large increase in the price of beef, there have also been increases in the price of  numerous other products .  Consumer Price Index figures  for September showed average grocery prices had increased since August (about 0.3%), since September 2024 (about 2.7%), and since January 2025 (about 1.4%), the month Trump returned to office. Prices in all six major grocery product categories tracked by the Consumer Price Index, such as “fruits and vegetables” and “cereals and bakery products,” are up over the past year.\n \n\n   \n   Inflation under Trump \n \n\n   \n  Trump falsely claimed, “We have no inflation” and “we don’t have any inflation.” (He said at another point of the interview that “essentially we don’t have inflation.”) He also falsely claimed, “We’re down to 2%, even less than 2%.” There is inflation; it has been  worsening since May  after hitting a four-year low in April; and it’s not 2% or less than 2%. The year-over-year rate was about  3% in September , up from about  2.9% in August ; the September figure was nearly identical to the roughly  3% rate in January , the last partial month of the Biden administration and first partial month of the second Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n   Inflation under Biden \n \n\n   \n  Trump falsely claimed that President Joe “Biden gave me the worst inflation rate in the history of our country” and that “I inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country.” Trump could have fairly said the US inflation  rate hit a 40-year high under Biden in June 2022 , when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the  all-time record of 23.7% , set in 1920 — and, again, the rate then declined to about 3% in January 2025, the month Trump took over from Biden. Trump’s claim was also wrong if he was claiming there was record cumulative inflation over the course of Biden’s presidency. It was about 21%, compared with about 49% during President Jimmy Carter’s term.\n \n\n   \n   Investment in the US \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his frequent false claim that “we have $17 trillion being invested in the United States right now,” then said moments later that it is “more than $17 trillion right now.” This “$17 trillion” figure is fictional even without the “more than.” As of the time the “60 Minutes” interview aired on Sunday, the White House’s  own website  said the “major investment announcements” this term totaled “$8.9 trillion” — and a detailed CNN review in October found the White House was counting trillions of dollars in vague investment pledges from foreign countries and companies, pledges that were about “bilateral trade” or “economic exchange” rather than investment in the US, or vague statements that didn’t even rise to the level of pledges. You can read more  here .\n \n\n   \n   Who pays tariffs \n \n\n   \n  Trump claimed, as he often does, that China and other foreign countries pay the tariffs he has imposed on their exports. In reality, US importers, not China or other foreign countries, make the tariff payments to the US government, and they often pass on at least some of the costs to consumers;  study  after  study , including  one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission ,  found  that people and entities in the US bore almost the entire cost of Trump’s first-term tariffs on Chinese products.\n \n\n   \n   AI and power \n \n\n   \n  Trump correctly noted that some artificial intelligence companies are moving to  generate their own power  on the same sites as their energy-hungry data centers — but falsely added that letting companies make their own electricity “was my idea, which nobody, frankly, had thought of.” There is simply no basis for Trump’s claim that he came up with this idea. News articles last year, when Trump was an out-of-office candidate for president, discussed how AI companies were  already experimenting with on-site power generation  and how the Biden administration was on board with the idea; one article from April 2024, for example,  discussed  how the Energy Department was “exploring how energy-hungry tech firms might be able to host small nuclear plants on the campuses of their massive data centers.”\n \n\n   \n    Foreign policy\n \n\n   \n   Strikes on alleged drug boats \n \n\n   \n  After Trump was asked about the recent US military strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, he said, “Every one of those boats kills 25,000 Americans. Every single boat that you see that’s shot down kills 25,000 on drugs, and destroys families all over our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the fact that the Trump administration has not presented public proof for his repeated claims that the boats carried fentanyl, the drug involved in the highest number of US overdose deaths — the Caribbean is  not known  to be a significant fentanyl-smuggling route — his “25,000” number does not make sense. The  total  number of US overdose deaths from all drugs in 2024 was about 82,000, according to provisional  federal data . Trump is essentially claiming, in other words, that  attacking 16 boats  prevented more than four years’ worth of American overdose deaths.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s figure is “absurd,” Carl Latkin, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health with a joint appointment at its medical school, said in October. “He’s claiming that he’s solved the overdose mortality crisis” with four boat strikes, and “that does not have any semblance of reality.” You can read a longer fact check  here .\n \n\n   \n   Trump and wars \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his false claim that he “knocked out eight wars,” adding, “I took eight wars and stopped (them) during an eight-month period” this presidency. Reading from a paper, he listed “Cambodia-Thailand,” “Kosovo-Serbia,” “the Congo and Rwanda,” “Pakistan and India,” “Israel and Iran,” “Egypt and Ethiopia,” “Armenia and Azerbaijan,” and “Israel and Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s “eight” figure is a clear exaggeration.\n \n\n   \n  There was no war between Egypt and Ethiopia for Trump to end; the two countries were in a long-running diplomatic dispute about a  major Ethiopian dam project  on a tributary of the Nile River, but that is not a war, and the dispute is  unresolved . Trump’s list includes  another supposed war that didn’t occur  during his presidency, between Kosovo and Serbia. (He has sometimes  claimed  to have prevented the eruption of a new war between those two entities, providing few details about what he meant, but that is different from settling an actual war.) And the war involving the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda  has continued  despite a peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration this year — which was never signed by the leading rebel coalition doing the fighting.\n \n\n   \n  One can debate the importance of Trump’s role in having ended the other conflicts on his list, or fairly question whether some of them have truly ended. For example, killing has  continued  in Gaza after the October ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Regardless, Trump’s “eight” figure is too big.\n \n\n   \n   Biden and aid to Ukraine \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his false claim that “Joe Biden gave $350 billion to Ukraine, including a lot of weapons, a tremendous amount of weapons.” The “$350 billion” figure isn’t close to accurate.\n \n\n   \n  The US government inspector general overseeing the federal Ukraine response  says  the US had disbursed about $94 billion as of the end of June 2025 (and had appropriated about $93 billion more), including money that was spent in the US and in broader Europe rather than Ukraine itself. And a German think tank that has closely  tracked  wartime aid to Ukraine says the US allocated about $135 billion to Ukraine (and had committed about $5 billion more) through August, at current exchange rates.\n \n\n   \n    Immigration\n \n\n   \n   The shutdown, Democrats and immigrants \n \n\n   \n  Talking about the ongoing government shutdown, Trump said of Democrats, “I can’t give them $1.5 trillion so that they can give welfare to people that came into our country illegally.” But that is not what Democrats are seeking.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are primarily proposing to reverse Trump-approved cuts to Medicaid and other health programs and to extend the enhanced pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Undocumented people are not eligible for either Obamacare subsidies or federal Medicaid insurance coverage (though hospitals are required to provide people with emergency care regardless of immigration status or ability to pay).\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s White House itself has  claimed  that Democrats are proposing to spend about $193 billion (not $1.5 trillion) on health care for “illegal immigrants and other non-citizens” and the White House published an itemized list that makes clear that even by its own contested calculations, the majority of even that smaller sum would be for these “other non-citizens” who are in the US legally.\n \n\n   \n  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, has  estimated  that the spending proposal the Democrats released in September would add $1.5 trillion to the debt over the next decade. But that figure is not about spending on undocumented people in particular.\n \n\n   \n   Foreign leaders, prisons and migration \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his regular claim that foreign countries are deliberately emptying their prisons to somehow send inmates to the US as migrants, at one point identifying Venezuela as a supposed culprit and at another point speaking more broadly — saying “very smart” foreign leaders “want people that are bad out” and so “what do they do? They open their jails, they let ‘em out. They get rid of their drug dealers, they let ‘em out. But you know who else they get out? The people that are on welfare that aren’t working. In other words, they have people that just don’t work. They don’t want people that just don’t work, so they put them into our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has never substantiated such claims, though he has been making them since his 2024 campaign. Experts on  international prison policy  and  crime in Venezuela  have told CNN they have seen no evidence of Venezuela or any other country emptying jails for migration purposes, let alone that these countries actively inserted former prisoners into the US.\n \n\n   \n   Migration under Biden \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his false claim that 25 million migrants were allowed into the country under Biden, though he was more tentative this time than usual, saying, “Probably, I say, 25 million people were let into our country. A lot of people say it was 10 million people. But whether it was 10 or — I believe I’m much closer to the right number. Of the 25, many of them should not be here.”\n \n\n   \n  The “25 million” figure is wildly inaccurate; even Trump’s previous “21 million” figure was a  major exaggeration . Through December 2024, the last full month under the Biden administration, the federal government had  recorded  under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during that administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country. Even adding in the so-called gotaways who evaded detection,  estimated  by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there’s no way the total was even close to Trump’s claim.\n \n\n   \n    Legal issues, impeachment and the 2020 election\n \n\n   \n   Previous presidents and the Insurrection Act \n \n\n   \n  Trump spoke of the Insurrection Act, which gives the president sweeping powers to deploy troops to US states if certain vague conditions are met, and said, “Do you know that some of the presidents, recent ones, have used it 28 times? 28 times.” No president has invoked the act on more occasions than President Ulysses S. Grant’s six (after the Civil War in the 1800s), and no president has invoked it since President George H.W. Bush in 1992, according to  research published in 2022  by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. In fact, the Insurrection Act and the similar laws that preceded it have been invoked on a  total  of 30 occasions in US history, the Brennan Center found.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also said, “Do you know how many presidents have used the Insurrection Act? Almost 50% of ‘em.” That’s at least a slight exaggeration.   Seventeen of the 45 presidents to date, so just under 38%, have invoked the act or its precursor laws, according to the Brennan Center.  You can read more  here .   \n \n\n   \n   Trump’s legal dispute with “60 Minutes” \n \n\n   \n  Trump discussed his  now-resolved  legal dispute with “60 Minutes” over an edit the show made to an October 2024 interview with his election opponent, then-Vice President Harris — and, as CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter  noted  Sunday, Trump falsely claimed this supposedly “election-changing” interview occurred “two nights before the election.”   The interview actually  happened on October 7, 2024 , four weeks and a day before Election Day on November 5, 2024.\n \n\n   \n  This wasn’t the first time Trump made the Harris interview sound closer to Election Day than it was. He falsely  claimed in June  that it occurred  “the day before the election.”\n \n\n   \n   Trump and the Justice Department \n \n\n   \n  CBS’ O’Donnell noted  the recent indictments  of three targets of Trump criticism — former FBI Director James Comey, former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, and New York Attorney General Letitia James — and asked him whether he instructed the Justice Department to “go after them”; Trump responded, “No, and not in any way, shape or form. No.” But this is obviously false: he recently put  public  pressure on the Justice Department to go after Comey and James.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  wrote  in a September social media  post  directed to “Pam” — Attorney General Pam Bondi, the head of the Justice Department — that Comey, James and Schiff are “all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” that “we can’t delay any longer” and that “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” (Trump intended the post to be a private message to Bondi, a source familiar with the matter told CNN after The Wall Street Journal first  reported  it.) Trump did not mention Bolton in that social media post; however, it’s worth noting he  previously made public calls  for his former adviser to be imprisoned over Bolton’s alleged inclusion of classified information in a memoir.\n \n\n   \n   A false story about Democrats and Trump’s first impeachment \n \n\n   \n  Trump delivered another version of a false story he  has told since 2019  about Democrats’ response to a phone call that year in which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into Biden, who was his looming opponent in the 2020 election. This time, Trump said, “The Democrats knew that I wasn’t guilty, because they didn’t know the — the call was — I didn’t know either: The call was essentially taped. So we knew exactly what the call — when they found out that the call was taped, Nancy Pelosi went crazy. She said, ‘You made me go into this mess.’ She screamed at all these people that made her do it, bad people like (Democratic Rep. Adam) Schiff, etc., etc.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s narrative is thoroughly inaccurate.\n \n\n   \n  Pelosi could not possibly have been angry with Schiff or other allies after finding out the call was “taped” because, more than six years later, there is still no known US tape of the conversation; presidential calls with foreign leaders  are not typically recorded by the American side . In reality, the day after Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry in September 2019, Trump’s White House released a  rough written transcript  of the call. There has never been any indication that seeing the rough transcript made Pelosi feel she had been deceived into the impeachment push; the day the document was released, Pelosi issued a  scathing statement  accusing Trump of “lawlessness” and attempting “to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.” A Pelosi spokesperson told CNN in 2024 that a Trump story similar to the one he told on “60 Minutes” was “fact-free nonsense.”\n \n\n   \n   Trump and the Presidential Records Act \n \n\n   \n  Trump decried the  FBI search  of his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in 2022, during the investigation into his handling of classified documents after his presidency, and he brought back his false claim that the Presidential Records Act permitted him to possess these documents: “They took things that I was allowed to have … under the Presidential Records Act, that I was allowed to have. I had records. I was allowed to have them.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s not true. The Presidential Records Act clearly says that all presidential records belong to the federal government  the moment the president leaves office . The  key sentence  from the law is unequivocal: “Upon the conclusion of a President’s term of office, or if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.”\n \n\n   \n   Jason R. Baron , former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told CNN when Trump made such claims during the Biden administration: “Under the Presidential Records Act, not a single document pertaining to the official business of the White House — classified or unclassified — should have been carted off to Mar-A-Lago. President Trump might consider such records to be ‘his,’ but they are not.”\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean Trump committed a criminal offense; the Presidential Records Act is not a criminal statute, and Trump was charged in 2023 for  allegedly violating other laws . (A judge appointed by Trump  dismissed the case  in 2024, declaring that the appointment of the special counsel who brought the charges violated the Constitution.) But Trump was,  again , wrongly describing what the act says.\n \n\n   \n   The 2020 election \n \n\n   \n  Trump uttered his regular lie that the 2020 election “was rigged and stolen,” saying at other moments of the interview that “this was a rigged election” and that “one thing I can tell you, the 2020 election was rigged.” Trump legitimately lost a free and fair election to Biden. Trump also falsely claimed, “And it’s been caught … and you see the same information that everybody else does. And it’s coming out now in spades.” Trump didn’t explain what he was talking about, but no election-rigging or widespread fraud has “been caught.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/himalaya-peak-avalanche-nepal-intl","dateOfPublication":"1117-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:17:00-05:00","title":"Avalanche on Nepal mountain Yalung Ri kills 7 including foreign climbers","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An avalanche on Mount Yalung Ri in Nepal on November 3, 2025, killed seven people, including five foreign climbers and two Nepali guides.

Scientists say it could happen again \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:05 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An  Antarctic glacier  shrunk by nearly 50% in just two months, the fastest retreat recorded in modern history, according to a new study — and the way it retreated could have big implications for  global sea level rise .\n \n\n   \n  The Hektoria Glacier, roughly the size of Philadelphia, is on the Antarctic Peninsula, a spindly chain of mountains sticking off the continent like a thumb pointing toward South America. It is  one of the fastest warming regions  on Earth.\n \n\n   \n  Grounded glaciers like Hektoria, which rest on the seabed and don’t float, generally retreat no more than a few hundred meters a year. But between November and December 2022, Hektoria   retreated by 5 miles, according to the  study  published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience.\n \n\n   \n  “This is astonishing; the rate of retreat is just crazy,” said Ted Scambos, a study author and senior research scientist for the Earth Science and Observation Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n \n\n   \n  Understanding more about why this happened is vital; if larger glaciers retreat at similar rates, it could have “catastrophic implications for sea level rise,” the authors wrote in a statement accompanying the report. Antarctica holds enough ice to raise   global sea level by  around 190 feet .\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria’s near demise was discovered by chance. Researchers had been surveying the bay where it’s located for a separate study. They were keeping a close eye on the area’s “fast ice” — sea ice fastened to land that doesn’t move with the wind or tides — believing it was about to break off and float out to sea.\n \n\n   \n  As Naomi Ochwat, a study co-author and postdoctoral associate at the University of Colorado Boulder, pored over the data, she noticed Hektoria had lost an enormous amount of ice over a very short period. “I realized that, OK, something special is going on here,” Ochwat told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She and her co-authors started to dig into what was happening, looking at satellite images and data from flyovers.\n \n\n   \n  They identified several steps that led﻿   to Hektoria’s rapid retreat. In 2011, the bay filled with fast ice, stabilizing the glaciers around it, allowing them to advance into the bay and form thick, floating ice tongues. In 2022, this fast ice broke out of the bay, destabilizing the glaciers, causing them to lose their ice tongues and retreat.\n \n\n   \n  The reason Hektoria fell apart much faster than its neighboring glaciers is due to what lies beneath it, the scientists found.\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria rests on an ice plain, where sliding ice glides over flat sediment on the seabed. Ice plains can prompt fast retreat because as the glacier thins, the ice starts to rise up and water pushes underneath into its crevasses, exerting pressure and causing large slabs to break off — in a process called calving.\n \n\n   \n  As one iceberg calves, it exposes the glacier behind it to the same pressures and calving happens again. Scambos likens the process to “dominoes toppling backwards, their feet slipping out from under them, one after the other.”\n \n\n   \n  This kind of ice plain melting has happened before. Models show that between about 15,000 and 19,000 years ago, during a period of warming that ended the last Ice Age, glaciers with ice plains retreated hundreds of meters a day. But “we hadn’t seen it play out live before, certainly not at this rate,” Ochwat said.\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria’s retreat   was heavily influenced by climate change, she added. The loss of sea ice in the ocean next to Hektoria, believed to have been driven by ocean warmth,   allowed wave swells to reach the fast ice and break it up, leaving the glacier exposed to ocean forces.\n \n\n   \n  As climate change accelerates, “we are likely to see more reductions of sea ice in this region,” said Bethan Davies, a glacial geologist at Newcastle University who was not involved in the study. This could result in other glaciers losing the sea ice that currently buttresses them, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria is a relatively small glacier by Antarctic standards, and its partial demise won’t cost the planet much in terms of sea level rise, Scambos said.\n \n\n   \n  However, “it’s a smaller cousin to some truly gigantic — I mean size of the island of Britain — glaciers in Antarctica that could conceivably go through the same process, as this whole evolution of the ice sheets on Earth evolves with global warming,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The next stage is to better establish which areas in Antarctica are vulnerable to the same process. If a huge glacier were to disintegrate quickly, “it means that we might have a step   change in sea level rise,” Ochwat said.\n \n\n   \n  Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the research, said the new findings “raise the bar on our understanding of how fast Antarctic glaciers may retreat.”\n \n\n   \n  These glaciers, especially the cavities beneath their ice shelves and tongues, are some of the most inaccessible environments on Earth, he told CNN, but knowing more about them is crucial to better project how they’ll respond to climate change. The research raises fears that ice loss from Antarctica, which contributes to sea-level rise, “could occur more rapidly than projected,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s yet another sign humanity still has a lot to learn about this vast, isolated continent. “We’re in a position where we’re still uncovering processes that we didn’t know about,” Ochwat said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/entertainment/huda-mustafa-olandria-carthen-racial-slur","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:04:00-05:00","title":"'Love Island' Cast Makes Racial Controversy After Live Stream Incident","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the ongoing 'Love Island USA' season 7, contestant Huda Mustafa and her boyfriend Louis Russell were embroiled in a controversy after a live stream incident where a viewer used a racial slur against Olandria Carthen, a fellow contestant.

continues to bring the drama even months after the season concluded.\n \n\n   \n  Huda Beauty has ended its relationship with one of the show’s alums, Huda Mustafa (who is not related to the company,

Olandria Carthen a racial slur.\n \n\n   \n  The pair quickly ended the call with Mustafa saying, “Yo, what the f**k? What did they say? They said a bad word” to which Russell, who was a contestant on Netflix’s “Too Hot To Handle” and “Perfect Match,” responded “They said a terrible word.”\n \n\n   \n  The moment went viral and the popular beauty brand recently posted on social media that “At Huda Beauty, kindness and humanity are at the heart of what we do.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are truly disappointed by Huda Mustafa’s recent live and we take all forms of racism very seriously,” the statement reads. “While we don’t believe her actions reflect her character, we found them deeply upsetting.”\n \n\n   \n  The company captioned their two page statement “This action was taken not because of any creator or influencers content, this was taken due to the lack of seriousness around the issue and to people close to us who were offended by the actions during the live. Please remember this is about accountability not canceling people.”\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Huda Beauty’s statement both Mustafa and Russell issued apologies.\n \n\n   \n  But it was Mustafa’s first statement posted on her Instagram stories that caused the hubbub to escalated. To some, it sounded like she was down-playing the incident, by saying she and Russell “did not hear it very well” when the person used the slur.\n \n\n   \n  A second statement, also posted on her stories, acknowledged that she had initially missed the mark with her first statement and offered a direct apology to Carthen.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to begin by saying I completely respect Olandria and it’s extremely disheartening that anyone, especially a presumed child, would find it excusable to use this type of language, and doing so only underlines the ignorance of the gravity that such a word carries. Olandria – it is now clear that this comment was targeted at you, and I apologize for my immediate reaction,” Mustafa wrote. “My reaction in that moment came from being caught off guard, not from finding the word or situation funny. It was a nervous, uncomfortable reaction that I recognize was inappropriate.”\n \n\n   \n  Russell also issued a statement writing “I’d like to extend my sincerest apology to all those affected by the caller who used language that completely goes against everything we stand for.”\n \n\n   \n  “As a Black man, I have a greater empathy through my own lived experiences battling racism and the idea that a flustered response to a very unnerving situation could be misinterpreted for me not taking the matter seriously is incredibly disheartening,” he wrote. “This was an extremely unfortunate situation, one that in no way reflects my values, not Huda’s.”\n \n\n   \n  Carthen also took to social media to express her feelings, writing that she does not “condone racism of any kind, nor do I entertain it.”\n \n\n   \n  “That kind of language is never acceptable,” she wrote. “Not in anger, not as a joke, not ever. Words like that carry generations of pain, and pretending otherwise only keeps the cycle going. Defending it, laughing about it, or making excuses is even worse.”\n \n\n   \n  Carthen encouraged her followers “to donate to organizations dedicated to educating and uplifting the Black community like UNCF, NAACP and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.”\n \n\n   \n  It was not the first time that Mustafa and Carthen have faced off regarding racism.\n \n\n   \n  During the reunion show which aired in August, Carthen took Mustafa to task for not better addressing Mustafa’s followers who had been racist towards Carthen.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Mustafa, Russell and Carthen for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “Love Island USA” is a spinoff of the popular UK series which seeks to link couples up to find love.

 By Billy Stockwell, Catherine Nicholls, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:18 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Several drones spotted above a Belgian airbase over the weekend were there “to spy” on military fighter jets, the country’s defense minister said Sunday, at a time when European nations are on high alert for airspace intrusions.\n \n\n   \n  “They come to spy, to see where the F-16s are, where the munitions are, and other highly strategic things,” Theo Francken told CNN affiliate RTBF.\n \n\n   \n  The drones were clearly “spying,” the minister said, noting the “long time” one of them had spent over the airbase.\n \n\n   \n  Kleine-Brogel Air Base, in the municipality of Peer, hosts the largest unit of Belgian defense forces in the country and aims to “fundamentally contribute to NATO’s nuclear deterrence strategy,” according to its website. Local media reports have long rumoured the presence of US nuclear weapons at the site.\n \n\n   \n  Belgium’s Ministry of Defense told CNN it cannot confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons at the base. When asked for comment, NATO referred CNN to the Belgian authorities.\n \n\n   \n  The latest sightings come as Europe is on high alert after recent incursions by drones and aircraft into NATO airspace.\n \n\n   \n  The airbase is home to F-16 fighter jets, the airbase’s website said, adding that these are set to be replaced by “ultramodern” F-35s within “a few years.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking of the latest sightings, Francken said that Russia is “trying to do this in all European countries” but stopped short of directly pinning the blame on Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “Is it the Russians now? I cannot say that, but the motives are clear,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Francken posted on X that three reports had been received the previous night of drones above Kleine-Brogel. The drones were of “a larger type and flying at higher altitude,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He stressed that they were not just flying over Kleine-Brogel, but were clearly monitoring the airbase.\n \n\n   \n  “A drone jammer was used, but without success … A helicopter and police vehicles chased the drone, but lost it after several kilometers,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The most recent sightings follow other reports of drones above Kleine-Brogel earlier on Saturday. Those sightings kicked off an investigation, with Francken declaring that it is “strictly forbidden to fly drones above military areas.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Lithuania  closed its border  with Belarus following “constant violations” of its airspace, the country’s foreign ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Belgian defense officials also reported that an  unspecified number  of drones flew over the country’s Elsenborn military base and toward the border with Germany.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"1113-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-05:00","title":"Civil trial resumes in $40 million lawsuit filed by teacher shot by student","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A $40 million civil lawsuit filed by former Virginia elementary school teacher Abby Zwerner, who was shot in her classroom by a 6-year-old student with a history of disciplinary issues, is resuming after weeks of testimony.

Damages are not warranted, Parker argues, because Zwerner has moved on with her life.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s lawyers pressed Zwerner and other witnesses last week about claims the shooting left the former teacher afraid to go out in public, citing Instagram messages about her attending a Taylor Swift Eras tour concert.\n \n\n   \n  They also sought during cross-examination to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking her how she managed to attend and graduate from cosmetology school since leaving teaching after the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s pain and suffering have been the focus of the trial so far, and Parker’s defense team this week is expected to continue to press Zwerner on whether there was more she could have done between learning of the possible gun threat and when she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Defense experts from outside Virginia are expected to testify this week, Casarez reported.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s lawsuit alleges Parker ignored “warnings from teachers and staff that students had seen the firearm” and the student had “removed an object that was likely a firearm from his backpack before it was searched.”\n \n\n   \n  Poor decisions led to the “avoidable” shooting, a grand jury report found last April.\n \n\n   \n    Teacher said she thought she was going to die\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner on Thursday testified she thought her wounds were dire.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought I was dying.

Both Christians and Muslims — the two main religious groups in the country of more than 230 million people — have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists, they say.\n \n\n   \n  The West African nation has grappled for years with deep-rooted security problems that are driven by various factors, including religiously motivated attacks. Observers say other violent conflicts arise from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to land and water resources.\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government rejects claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence, saying it was bewildered by Trump’s suggestion of a potential military intervention.\n \n\n   \n  “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, Trump threatened to stop all US aid to Nigeria if its government fails to take steps to stop the killings of Christians. He warned that the proposed intervention would be “fast and vicious,” aimed at eliminating the “Islamic Terrorists” he said were responsible for these atrocities.\n \n\n   \n    Is Trump correct about a mass slaughter of Christians in Nigeria?\n \n\n   \n  As Trump’s war threats echo among Nigerians, his assertion that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” has provoked strong reactions from many within the country.\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria has nearly equal numbers of Christians and Muslims, with the northern region predominantly Muslim and the southern region largely Christian.\n \n\n   \n  In 2012, the Islamist group Boko Haram  issued an ultimatum , ordering Christians in the northern region to leave while calling on Muslims in the south to “come back” to the north.\n \n\n   \n  John Joseph Hayab, a pastor who leads the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the country’s northern region, where attacks by Islamist groups are prevalent, told CNN that he agrees with Trump’s claim of “systematic killings of Christians” in that area. However, he added, “there has been a little shift in the last two years,” with the scale of the killings reducing.\n \n\n   \n  Hayab said he had presided over numerous mass burials of slain Christians, stating that “every state in northern Nigeria has suffered its own terrible share of killings targeting Christians.”\n \n\n   \n  He urged the Nigerian government to acknowledge the issue and take measures to correct the killings rather than deny them.\n \n\n   \n  “We have raised this matter dozens of times, but nobody hears us,” he claimed, acknowledging the role of US Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in bringing attention to reports of alleged Christian persecution in Nigeria.\n \n\n   \n  In August, the Republican senator  introduced a bill  calling for sanctions against Nigeria for purported violations of religious freedom.\n \n\n   \n  Some analysts argue that while Christians have been targeted by Boko Haram and other Islamist groups seeking to impose their extreme interpretation of Islamic law, Muslims, including those considered moderate, have also been victims of those groups.\n \n\n   \n  Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian human rights advocate specializing in security and development, disputed Trump’s comments, telling CNN that they “reflect a dangerous oversimplification of Nigeria’s complex security crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  He stated: “The claim that there is a ‘mass slaughter of Christians’ by ‘Islamic radicals’ distorts the reality on the ground and risks deepening divisions in a country already under immense strain.”\n \n\n   \n    High profile killings in predominantly Christian areas draw international attention\n \n\n   \n  Northern Nigeria has witnessed horrific killings targeting religious groups this year. In April, gunmen believed to be Muslim herders,  killed at least 40 people , including children, in a predominantly Christian farming village, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  Two months later, more than 100 people were massacred by attackers in Yelwata, a largely Christian community in Benue state, also in the north-central,  according  to Amnesty International.\n \n\n   \n  Pope Leo XIV offered prayers for the victims of the Yelwata attack, many of whom were “internally displaced persons sheltered by a local Catholic mission,” a  Vatican news report  said.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the northern region, such targeted killings are rare. A  a mass shooting at a church in Owo , a community in southwestern Nigeria, left dozens dead in 2022. Court filings  seen by Reuters  linked the suspects in the Owo massacre to al-Shabaab, a militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda operating in East Africa.\n \n\n   \n  Muslims have also been victims of targeted killings this year. In August,  at least 50 worshippers were killed  — some shot, others burned alive — when gunmen attacked a mosque in the north-western Katsina State, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  Many similarly brutal attacks have been carried out in Muslim communities by Boko Haram and other armed groups in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, these (extremist) groups have sadly killed many Christians. However, they have also massacred tens of thousands of Muslims,” Bukarti said. He noted that “the groups’ attacks on other civilian locations such as markets, bus stops and refugee camps (disproportionately) harm Muslims,” as the states where the radical groups operate are predominantly Muslim.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Trump’s rhetoric (suggesting a mass slaughter of Christians) not only misinforms the international community but also risks fuelling extremist propaganda and undermining local efforts to build peace,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    What does the data reveal?\n \n\n   \n  Claims that Christians are being disproportionately targeted by extremists in Nigeria are not supported by what little data is available.\n \n\n   \n  Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, a crisis-monitoring group,  reported  that more than 20,400 civilians were killed in attacks in Nigeria between January 2020 and September of this year. Among those casualties, 317 deaths were attributed to attacks targeting Christians, while 417 deaths were reported among Muslims, though the organization did not include the religious affiliation of the vast majority of the civilians killed.\n \n\n   \n  Security analyst Nnamdi Obasi, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, explained that while extremist groups have wreaked havoc against both Christians and Muslims in the northeast of Nigeria, bandit groups have terrorized predominantly Muslim communities in the northwest. Additionally, predominantly Christian farming communities in parts of the North Central zone have suffered persistent violence from armed groups.\n \n\n   \n  However, “in most parts of the country, Christians and Muslims live peacefully with each other,” he said. “Reports of widespread persecution and mass slaughter of Christians are seriously misread and exaggerate the challenges of interfaith relations in the country.”\n \n\n   \n  Ken Eluma Asogwa, a spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, told CNN that “even though the government of Nigeria has been lackluster and shambolic in its approach to the protection of its citizens from murderous non-state actors operating under different aliases, there is no evidence to support Trump’s claims that Christians are particularly targeted for extermination.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump designated Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” under the US  International Religious Freedom Act . The label is a suggestion that his administration has found that Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has so far remained silent about Trump’s mention of potential military intervention but pushed back against the designation, stating in a social media  post  that “the characterization of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.”\n \n\n   \n    Would US military action be likely to stop the killings?\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not ruled out the possibility of sending US troops to Nigeria or launching airstrikes in the country, telling reporters on Sunday, “I envisage a lot of things.”\n \n\n   \n  But analyst Obasi said that any unilateral US military operation against Islamist groups in Nigeria would not address the underlying factors driving instability there.\n \n\n   \n  Such an intervention, he said, “without the involvement of Nigerian security forces, would be predictably unwelcome by many Nigerians and could further destabilize the country, aggravating its security situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Instead, he urged the Nigerian government to “intensify efforts to end the mass killings of citizens,” regardless of their religious or other identities, and to address religious extremism, tensions over resources and banditry, “which are the underlying drivers of most of the mass killings.”\n \n\n   \n  Bulama, the human rights advocate, believes the Nigerian government can address Trump’s criticism by “moving beyond defensiveness.”\n \n\n   \n  “It should meet misinformation with data,” he suggested, adding that “this moment calls for candor, not posturing.”\n \n\n   \n  “Constructive dialogue, not social-media outrage, will best serve Nigeria’s interests — and the cause of peace,” he advised.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/uk/england-train-stabbing-driver-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:24:00-04:00","title":"‘Heroic’ actions of train employee and driver saved many lives in England stabbing attack, police say","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a stabbing attack on a high-speed LNER train heading to London in England, a 32-year-old man named Anthony Williams was arrested within 11 minutes of the first emergency call, after a suspect attacked passengers on the train.

\nUpdated: \n        11:24 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There were just 11 minutes between the moment British police received an emergency call about a  stabbing on a train  heading to London and the moment the suspect was arrested.\n \n\n   \n  Eleven victims were hospitalized in the attack, including one railway worker who is in critical but stable condition, according to authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have said the casualties would have been far worse if not for the actions of the driver who arranged for the train to be diverted to a nearby station, and a “heroic” railway worker who tried to stop the attacker on the train.\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train, which was taking passengers from northern England to the British capital on Saturday evening, had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place. The first emergency call to Cambridgeshire police was at approximately 7:39 p.m. local time. By 7:50 p.m., officers had arrested the 32-year-old British suspect on the platform at Huntingdon station, police told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The critically injured train worker has not yet been publicly identified.\n \n\n   \n  British Transport Police (BTP) said that “detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives.”\n \n\n   \n  “The bravery that he showed was utterly remarkable… he put himself in harm’s way,” British Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told the BBC on Monday. “There are people who are alive today who wouldn’t be alive had it not been for his actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Five other casualties have now been discharged from hospital, BTP said in an update on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander also paid tribute to emergency services and, in particular, the train driver, “who had the presence of mind to phone the signals in Network Rail and get the train onto that slow line into Huntingdon station and a place of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed train was scheduled to pass through the station on a fast line, but driver and signalers quickly arranged for it to divert onto a slow track so it could stop alongside the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Open-source data shows that a signaler made the first alteration to the train’s planned route at 7:40 p.m. local time – only one minute after police received the first call about the attack. Another local train was already at the platform at Huntingdon – once it had left, the signaler was able to guide the LNER train safely into the platform where it stopped by 7:44 p.m.\n \n\n   \n  Huntington station happens to be around the corner from the Cambridgeshire Constabulary police headquarters, and both response officers and armed officers were quickly on the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, the UK’s PA Media news agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Train driver Andrew Johnson told ITV News: “I was only doing my job. It was my colleague who is in hospital who was the brave one.” Johnson, from Peterborough, is reported by British media to have served in the Royal Navy for 17 years.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has been praised for remaining calm as the attack unfolded and choosing not to make an emergency stop between stations, where it would have been more difficult for authorities to respond. Instead, the swift decisions by Johnson and the signaler enabled the train to be stopped at Huntingdon; the next opportunity would have been a station seven minutes further down the line.\n \n\n   \n  Train drivers in the United Kingdom have extensive route training and are required to know the location of every signal and track layout on their route, including in the dark. Signalers have similar detailed knowledge.\n \n\n   \n  Nigel Roebuck, an organizer for the train drivers’ union ASLEF and a lead officer with LNER, told British media that “the driver did everything he was trained to do, at the right time and in the right way.”\n \n\n   \n  “He showed real courage, real dedication, and real determination in the most difficult of circumstances,” Roebuck added. “Our thoughts tonight are with his colleague who is still in intensive care.”\n \n\n   \n    Suspect charged with multiple attempted murders\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive for the attack but said that there was no evidence to suggest it was terror related.\n \n\n   \n  The man apprehended, Anthony Williams, 32, of Peterborough, was charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of bladed article. He was also charged with another count of attempted murder in connection with an incident that happened earlier on Saturday at a station in London. Williams was remanded in custody after appearing in court on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  While in court, he wasn’t asked to enter pleas and he said “no fixed abode” when he was asked about his address, according to the UK’s PA Media. His next appearance in court is due to be on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  A second man was initially arrested at the scene, but he was later released without charge.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, three more incidents believed to be linked to the attacker took place in Peterborough on Friday evening and Saturday morning, according to Cambridgeshire police. One of those included a stabbing in Peterborough city center, in which a 14-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n    Witnesses describe running from attack\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  At first she thought it was a Halloween prank, but it became clear it was a genuine attack when the man shouted that someone had a knife and more people came running down the train.\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train restrooms, said other witnesses. Other passengers were able to hide themselves in the train’s buffet carriage.\n \n\n   \n  Another witness, Thomas McLachlan, told the BBC: “There were definitely many heroes on that day, many kind people who just wanted to help those around them – people handing out blankets, hand warmers.”\n \n\n   \n  McLachlan said he saw one injured man who had been slashed in the face. He and another witness told local media that he heard the man had been “trying to protect a young girl from being attacked” when he was stabbed.\n \n\n   \n  One of the victims still in the hospital is Scunthorpe United player Jonathan Gjoshe, the soccer club said in a statement, which said he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about other victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n  LNER managing director David Horne said in a statement that he would like to recognize the “driver, crew and our operational response colleagues for their bravery and quick actions.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Sophie Tanno and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/kimberly-clark-kenvue-acquisition","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:47:00-05:00","title":"Tylenol’s Parent Company to Merge with Huggies Maker in $48.7 Billion Deal","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kimberly-Clark has announced a $48.7 billion acquisition of Kenvue, the parent company of Tylenol, creating a massive global consumer products conglomerate with 10 billion-dollar brands.

But it also represents a gamble that one of Kenvue’s signature products will be able to withstand increased scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  The acquisition comes a few weeks after President Donald Trump made  unfounded claims  linking autism to Tylenol use during pregnancy, sending Kenvue’s stock sharply lower. The company has  staunchly pushed back  against his administration’s accusations.\n \n\n   \n  The companies said that the combined business will bring together 10 billion-dollar brands and will drive annual revenue of $32 billion. The new company will make products that “touch nearly half the global population through every stage of life,” including Johnson’s baby products, Clean & Clear skin care, Kleenex, Listerine mouthwash, and Depends adult diapers, the companies said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n   Kenvue was spun off in 2022  from Johnson & Johnson, with J&J keeping its recognizable name for its larger pharmaceutical business unit and offloading its consumer brands. It was widely expected to be an acquisition target.\n \n\n   \n  The transaction is scheduled to close in the second half of next year. Following the closing, Kimberly-Clark shareholders will own about 54% of the newly combined company, with Kenvue shareholders owning the rest.\n \n\n   \n    A risky bet\n \n\n   \n  The deal comes with some considerable risks.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Kenvue reported an overall sales decline of 4.4%, as well as its its self care unit, which includes Tylenol, falling 5.3% for the quarter ending on September 28.\n \n\n   \n  The company explained that the sales declines were the result of “trade inventory reductions in certain customers,” likely that from cash-strapped customers trading down to cheaper, private labels that offer similar quality — perhaps a warning a sign to the new company that’s betting on a lineup of name-brand companies.\n \n\n   \n  And Kenvue faces potentially intense legal scrutiny over the Trump administration’s claims. Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton  filed a lawsuit against Kenvue , claiming that the company “deceptively” marketed Tylenol to pregnant women and that the medication is tied to an increased risk of autism. Kenvue said it will “vigorously defend” against the claims.\n \n\n   \n  Kimberly-Clark CEO Mike Hsu addressed the Tylenol issue on a call with analysts Monday, saying its “board carefully considered all the risks and all the opportunities” and had multiple meetings with “medical, regulatory and legal experts” and decided that the deal is a “generational value creation opportunity for both companies.”\n \n\n   \n  “We stand firmly behind the science and the safety of our products,” added Kenvue CEO Kirk Perry. “These things have been studied for decades, and we continue to stand by that science as the medical community does as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The cash-and-stock deal has Kimberly-Clark ( KMB ) paying $21.01 for each Kenvue ( KVUE ) share, a hefty premium over the $14.37 of its Friday closing price.\n \n\n   \n  But the premium is only slightly higher than the $17 a share Kenvue’s stock was trading for just before Trump held his “don’t take Tylenol” news conference on September 22. And it’s only a hair above the $20 stock price right before the first news reports suggested that the Trump administration may make a link between Tylenol and autism.\n \n\n   \n  Kenvue’s stock soared more than 16% Monday. Kimberly-Clark’s stock fell nearly 13%.\n \n\n   \n    An M&A explosion\n \n\n   \n  The deal comes as the deregulatory environment ushered in with the Trump administration has led to a rush of mergers and acquisitions.\n \n\n   \n  The Kenvue deal is the third-largest acquisition this year, according to mergers-and-acquisitions data provider Dealogic. The $72 billion deal between railroad companies  Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern  ranks first and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund  purchase  of video games maker Electronics Arts for $55 million places second.\n \n\n   \n  After deals cooled off considerably in the post-pandemic era, M&A appears to be back in a big way this year. So far, 2025 has produced $1.9 trillion in deals in the United States, up the highest since 2021, according to Dealogic. Excluding the pandemic-fueled M&A boom, 2025’s deals hold the highest collective value since 2015 and are on pace to surpass it.\n \n\n   \n  The Kimberly-Clark acquisition of Kenvue would be the fourth-largest consumer products deal of all time, behind only Altria’s $111 billion spin-off of Philip Morris International in 2008, British American Tobacco’s 2015 purchase of Reynolds American for $64 billion, and P&G’s 2005 Gillette acquisition for $61 billion.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/asia/northern-afghanistan-earthquake-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:47:00-05:00","title":"Deadly quake rocks Afghanistan leaving iconic Blue Mosque surrounded by rubble","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck northern Afghanistan near Mazar-i-Sharif on November 3, 2025, killing at least 20 people and injuring over 600.

The girl was taken to hospital in a critical condition, a spokesperson for the 209 Al-Fath Army Corp told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mazar-i-Sharif’s iconic Blue Mosque was damaged in the quake, footage on social media geolocated by CNN revealed, with its base littered with rubble - early evidence of the destruction captured in the shadows before dawn.\n \n\n   \n  The site is one of Afghanistan’s architectural treasures and a major point of pilgrimage, believed by some to be the resting place of Hazrat Ali, the fourth Caliph of Islam and the son-in-law of Prophet Mohammad.\n \n\n   \n  Residents in at least nine provinces, including Kabul, lost power after electricity lines from Uzbekistan – a major supplier of power to Afghanistan – were severed.\n \n\n   \n  The state-run energy company DABS also reported cut lines from Tajikistan to Kunduz province, plunging the area into total blackout. Teams are “working urgently to restore both routes,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Government officials put the death toll at 20 with more than 600 people injured across the Samangan, Balkh, Sar-e-Pul, Kunduz and Jawzjan provinces, in an update on Monday afternoon. The Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority also suggested casualties could rise further as “search and rescue operations are still ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  The National Authority for Disaster Preparedness said the quake struck at around 1 a.m. local time, impacting parts of the north, east and west, with the epicenter located in Samangan.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations confirmed it has teams on the ground “to assess needs and deliver urgent aid.”\n \n\n   \n  India also offered support in the wake of the earthquake, according to a post from foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on X. He wrote, “Indian relief material for the earthquake impacted communities is being handed over today. Further supplies of medicines to reach soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Afghanistan has endured a series of earthquake in recent years that have caused thousands of deaths and the USGS models estimate the shaking from Monday’s quake could result in hundreds of fatalities.\n \n\n   \n  The impoverished country’s ability to respond to natural disasters has been further impeded by a shortage in international aid following the Taliban’s successful takeover in the wake of the  chaotic withdrawal of US-led forces  in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Damage to properties was also reported in the affected areas, the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority said, with accounts of broken windows and structural damage to homes.\n \n\n   \n  One resident of Mazar-i-Sharif told CNN that her family “woke up terrified” after the quake struck, saying that her children ran “down the stairs screaming” when it occurred.\n \n\n   \n  “I had never experienced such a strong earthquake in my life,” said Rahima, a former school teacher, 50, adding that it broke some of her windows and damaged the plaster on some of her walls.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy that my house is made of concrete in the city,” she told CNN. “I don’t know if houses made of mud have survived this earthquake in the outskirts of the city.”\n \n\n   \n  The quake also blocked the Tashqurghan passage, a critical route from the capital of Kabul towards neighboring Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, but rescue teams have since cleared the route, the Ministry of Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  In Tashqurghan district, rubble and debris can be seen strewn across roads as bodies are carried away following the quake, according to footage from state broadcaster Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA). In another clip from RTA, people can be seen carefully making their way through the debris, scanning the ground with flashlights, with wrecked vehicles nearby.\n \n\n   \n  The earthquake was felt in regions of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, three countries that border northern Afghanistan, USGS reported.\n \n\n   \n  Back in August, at least 2,200 people were killed and thousands more were injured after a  6.0-magnitude quake  caused widespread damage along a mountainous stretch of provinces in eastern Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  The region was hit by at least five aftershocks, the strongest measuring 5.2 magnitude in the hours after the initial quake, according to USGS.\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children, which has also deployed a team to the area, said while the scale of the destruction will take time to clarify, the impact on children’s mental health was immediate.\n \n\n   \n  “This is tragically the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit Afghanistan. As temperatures fall, thousands of children in the earthquake-devastated east of the country are facing the winter with only tents for protection from the rain and snow,” said Samira Sayed Rahman, the organization’s programme development and advocacy director for Afghanistan. “Now, families in the north are also experiencing fear and uncertainty after this latest powerful quake.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2023, another  6.3-magnitude earthquake  took place in western Afghanistan, killing more than 2,000.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/dearborn-fbi-raid-terror-attack-skepticism","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:05:00-05:00","title":"Suspects Charged in Alleged Terror Plot in Michigan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal authorities in Michigan have charged two individuals, Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud, in connection with an alleged terror plot involving the unlawful transfer of firearms, which the FBI claims was inspired by ISIS.

Waldman, Jeff Winter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:05 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Federal authorities have charged two suspects in connection with what the FBI director described as  a possible terror plot .\n \n\n   \n  Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud face charges of “Receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to a criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, they could face up to 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, said a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.\n \n\n   \n    How a Halloween raid unfolded\n \n\n   \n  In the predawn hours of Halloween, residents of a quaint Michigan neighborhood were jolted awake by the blasts of detonated smoke bombs and a voice shouting in Arabic.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the FBI. We have a warrant. All residents inside … come out with nothing in your hands,” a man yelled before armed federal agents stormed the home in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, FBI Director Kash Patel  boasted on X  the agency had “thwarted a potential terrorist attack” and arrested “multiple” people in Dearborn “allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  Considered to be the heart of Arab America, Dearborn is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States and has frequently faced Islamophobic and hateful remarks.  Abdullah Hammoud , the son of Lebanese immigrants, became the first Arab American mayor of Dearborn when he was elected in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the community, including neighbors and attorneys for the people taken into custody, say they are skeptical of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  One of these neighbors is Laraib Irfan, who says his Dearborn community is a close-knit, peaceful place where everyone looks out for each other like family.\n \n\n   \n  Irfan was woken up Friday morning by his sister, telling him the FBI agents were outside. He heard two bangs he described as so loud they sounded like bombs and gunfire.\n \n\n   \n  He watched in shock as FBI agents surrounded the house two doors away from his. To his knowledge, the house was home to a family of seven – a mother, father and five sons.\n \n\n   \n  At the sound of the FBI’s command, the residents stepped out of their home with their hands behind their backs, Irfan said. For hours afterward, agents filed in and out, carrying materials to gather evidence, as Michigan State Police cordoned off the surrounding streets, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others questioned, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case told CNN on Friday; their ages range from 16 to no more than 29. Amir Makled, who represents one of the people arrested in the alleged plot, told CNN on Sunday three people were arrested and two were questioned. CNN has reached out to the FBI for clarification.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The two law enforcement sources told CNN about a reference to “pumpkin day,” an online chat about an ISIS-inspired attack and a shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s, but actual details of the alleged plot are scarce.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Hussein Bazzi, who says he is representing another one of the people arrested following the raid, told CNN the “pumpkin day” reference may have been “online gamer chat that was misinterpreted.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI told CNN it was conducting law enforcement activities in the cities of Dearborn and nearby Inkster, Michigan, but has not responded to CNN’s request for additional comment.    \n \n\n   \n  Patel’s initial X post applauded the FBI for “crushing our mission to defend the homeland,” yet he gave no explanation or evidence to support claims of a foiled terrorist plot.\n \n\n   \n  “More details to come,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s curious to me,” Colin Clarke, a domestic terrorism and international security expert, told CNN. “What it makes me think is that the plot wasn’t maybe as mature as they led people to believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke, executive director of the security research nonprofit The Soufan Center, says authorities may be holding back details to protect a potential prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re waiting to comment on it so they don’t go out and say anything that ends up hurting them in a court case,” said Clarke, who has no direct knowledge of the investigation. “Or there’s not much to this, the plot, there wasn’t much there.”\n \n\n   \n  Only time will reveal the full story, he said. The delay in charges often depends on how long the FBI has been tracking an alleged plot. His central concern, he added, is whether the claim the plot was inspired by ISIS has any basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Was there an actual ISIS operative communicating with these individuals, or were they just communicating with one another?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But for Dearborn’s community, the prolonged silence from authorities is raising serious concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “An allegation like this is dangerous to this community,” Makled said. “So when you have the national director of the FBI putting out a statement that there was a thwarted terrorist attack and then the news covers the raids of homes in the city of Dearborn, immediately the backlash on the internet is homegrown terrorist cell.”\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the raid posted on  Facebook  sparked bigoted comments: “A real shocker that they reside in Dearborn,” one person wrote. “Well, Dearborn does have a major Islamic population who aren’t exactly friendly to anyone else,” said another. Some accused the people in the home of being “sleeper cells.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Dearborn’s large Arab population, which makes up nearly half the city, makes it an easy target for Islamophobic, racist comments, the city has been ranked the second-safest large city in Michigan, according to the FBI’s  2024 annual crime report .\n \n\n   \n  “This community has been part of the state of Michigan for generations,” Makled, a Lebanese American and lifelong Dearborn resident, said. “They’re deeply ingrained in the American fabric here and this community, they’re sick and tired of being held to a different standard.”\n \n\n   \n  A neighbor, who asked to only be identified as “Ahmed,” said the people who lived in the home were kind, and he was not convinced the raid was based on credible suspicion.\n \n\n   \n  “You never hear anything from them, they are perfect, smiling, and I do not believe anything happened (from them), they are very good people,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the FBI’s claim they stopped a terrorist plot, Ahmed interrupts and rejects the possibility completely: “No, no, no, no,” he says. “I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   \n  Another neighbor, Kathy Sisson, also speaks highly of her community; she says she’s disabled and her neighbors, who are from Brazil, Pakistan and Iraq, are constantly checking on her to make sure she’s OK.\n \n\n   \n  A person in the home where the FBI activity took place who did not want to share their name told CNN the people taken into custody “were just kids” and the situation was “being blown out of proportion and shouldn’t have happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke warned against hasty conclusions but expressed skepticism that officials could credibly claim a foiled terrorist plot without clear, compelling evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “For the administration to come out and say they thwarted a plot, I feel like they (would need) stronger evidence than just a bunch of teenagers talking sh*t in a chat room,” Clarke said.\n \n\n   \n  Makled said his client’s mother has not stopped crying.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that my client has stopped thinking or slept for one second since the moment he’s been taken into custody because of how deeply concerned he is about what the future is bringing,” he said. “He has no control in terms of what the federal government is going to say about him.”\n \n\n   \n    Muslim American communities are exhausted\n \n\n   \n  For many, the incident harks back to the post-9/11 era, when Arab Americans were routinely subjected to false stereotypes, covert surveillance, unequal restrictions and, all too often, threats from people who were violent and driven by hate.\n \n\n   \n  “I know what went on after 9/11 and how our Arab and Muslim communities felt after that,” Clarke said. “Of course they’re under the microscope, even with the New York City  mayor’s race , you see a lot of Islamophobia kind of rearing its head again. We just don’t know.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the attack on the Twin Towers in New York, the FBI has prevented  numerous  suspected terrorist attacks by running undercover operations, where agents say they have infiltrated extremist networks to catch people who would have committed crimes.\n \n\n   \n  However, Muslims have often borne the brunt of racialized state surveillance. Many were suspected of domestic terrorism, through everyday actions that were disproportionately scrutinized and subjected to FBI attention solely because of their faith, according to a  2018 study published in Critical Sociology  examining patterns of surveillance targeting Muslim communities.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to be targeted and always looked at with a sense of suspicion. Dearborn’s used to this,” Makled said. “This community doesn’t want to be held in that light of suspicion anymore, and it doesn’t deserve to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Michigan chapter of the Council on American–Islamic Relations criticized the FBI’s lack of transparency in the days after the arrests. Executive Director Dawud Walid stressed that, no matter what the investigation uncovers, Muslims in Dearborn and across the US do not owe anyone an apology for the actions of others.\n \n\n   \n  “People in the community are getting tired of this idea of collective guilt, or somehow we have to answer for the alleged actions of a couple of people,” Walid told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Makled urged the public to withhold judgment and wait for the results of the investigation before making assumptions about the community as additional details from the FBI are still pending.\n \n\n   \n  If Patel put out a statement prematurely, “I would demand an apology from the national director,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how you create unity,” he added. “And that’s how you cure any error or harm that was caused by a mistake.

November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  China has agreed to allow the export of chips critical to auto production, averting  widespread shutdowns  that had been predicted by the industry.\n \n\n   \n  The chips are provided by Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands. It’s a critical supplier for the global auto industry, providing 40% of the automotive chips in the market segment that includes transistors and diodes, according to research firm TechInsights.\n \n\n   \n  After the Dutch government  took control  of Nexperia several weeks ago and removed its Chinese CEO, citing national security concerns, Beijing suspended shipments from China. Auto industry trade groups in the United States and Europe both feared the trade dispute would lead them to run out of the chips they needed. That could drive up  car prices , as happened in the years following the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that “The Dutch government’s inappropriate interference in the company’s internal affairs has led to the current chaos in the global supply chain.”\n \n\n   \n  But after US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping  met last week , Beijing said it would allow customers to apply for exemptions from a recently imposed export control and get the chips they need.\n \n\n   \n  “As a responsible major country, China fully considers the security and stability of domestic and international supply chains,” according to a statement Saturday from China’s Ministry of Commerce. “We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of the companies and grant exemptions to eligible exports.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dutch government  took control  of Nexperia last month under pressure from the US government, which had placed its Chinese parent company, Wingtech, on a blacklist of companies it saw as posing a national security threat. In response to the Dutch action, the Chinese government ordered the export controls that stopped shipments of Nexperia chips for weeks.\n \n\n   \n  A US-based auto industry   trade group hailed the latest action and thanked Trump for the agreement with China that it said had averted the crisis. It called the agreement “obviously, a positive resolution to a potentially disruptive situation that should keep US and global automaking on track.”\n \n\n   \n  “Credit to President Trump and his team for insisting Nexperia was on the agenda during talks this week with China and for treating the global semiconductor supply chain as the economic and national security issue it so clearly is,” said John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the trade group representing most automakers operating in North America.\n \n\n   \n  But a European trade group said while the Chinese announcement is good news for the industry, there are still concerns the crisis has not completely passed.\n \n\n   \n  “A number of practical questions remain as to how the exemption for export controls will be granted,” said a statement from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. “Until the secure flow of goods begins again, the situation will remain critical.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/justice-department-election-monitors","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:20:00-05:00","title":"What to know about Justice Department election monitors","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Justice Department is sending federal election monitors to polling locations in New Jersey and California, two politically significant states with crucial off-year elections.

Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:20 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department is  dispatching federal monitors  to polling locations in New Jersey and California, two Democratic states with crucial off-year elections on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement put the decadeslong federal monitoring practice under new scrutiny, as some Democrats and voting rights activists worry that this year’s monitors could be used to undermine the voting process or as a precursor to sow   doubts about the election.\n \n\n   \n  Election monitors, who are Justice Department employees often highly trained in voting laws, have been dispatched by both Republican and Democratic administrations, usually in coordination with local officials, to sit at polling locations and watch for instances where federal voting rights laws may have been violated.\n \n\n   \n  But this year is different, some experts say, in part because the election monitors are being deployed after requests from local Republican parties. Those requests featured complaints of improper handling of ballots and other purported election irregularities as opposed to potential breaches of the Voting Rights Act.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ officials insist that monitors are being sent out in normal order.\n \n\n   \n     Who, and what, are federal election monitors? \n \n\n   \n  Federal election monitors are lawyers who work for the Justice Department, typically either in its Civil Rights Division or in local US attorneys’ offices. They are not law enforcement officers or federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  The monitors are tasked with making sure that federal voting rights laws are being followed, including the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits intimidation and threats against those who are casting ballots or counting votes, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates that election officials ensure people with disabilities have the full and equal opportunity to vote.\n \n\n   \n  While they may sound imposing, federal monitors are not there to enforce laws. Monitors are allowed only to observe and take notes. They can’t talk to voters or poll workers, don’t have access to voting machines or ballots and are not involved in tallying votes.\n \n\n   \n  The monitors typically remain outside polling places and enter only with permission from local election officials.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re not to become part of the story. You’re not even supposed to fix problems,” David Becker, a former Department of Justice voting rights attorney who now runs the Center for Election Innovation & Research, told CNN. “You’re just supposed to take notes.”\n \n\n   \n  Voters may not even be aware that federal monitors are present, Becker said, noting that political parties and individual campaigns often send their own monitors as well.\n \n\n   \n  During the 2024 presidential election, monitors were sent to 27 states. For the 2022 midterms, the DOJ monitors were in 24 states. And in 2020, during President Donald Trump’s first term, the department sent monitors to 18 states.\n \n\n   \n     Why are people concerned this year? \n \n\n   \n  While the dispatching of federal election monitors is routine, their targets this year have amplified concerns from critics who say the Justice Department is using federal law to promote Trump’s personal agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Becker, who was a federal monitor during several elections, told CNN it is highly unusual for the Justice Department to monitor polling places for “ballot security,” a description the department gave in a  press release  last month, as the DOJ typically watches for compliance with the Voting Rights Act.\n \n\n   \n  Compounding concerns is that both states have high-profile races — New Jersey is home to a  race for governor , while voters in California are  deciding whether  to redraw congressional maps to create five Democratic-friendly seats.\n \n\n   \n  California’s redistricting effort is part of a nationwide scramble by political parties to gain the upper hand in next year’s midterm elections for the US House. Trump instigated the redistricting battle by pushing Republicans in Texas to  draw five additional seats  to benefit Republicans in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  After it was announced that monitors would be sent to California, Gov. Gavin Newsom  claimed  the Justice Department’s move was aimed at suppressing votes in the state. Earlier last month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state would deploy its own observers to monitor the attorneys dispatched by the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t need evidence of irregularities. I simply need a basis to believe that it would be helpful for the DOJ to be there, and that’s it,” Harmeet Dhillon, who runs the department’s Civil Rights Division,  told CNN ’s Elex Michaelson. “We are not there to interfere. We are there to observe. We are there to document.”\n \n\n   \n  But the department has so far taken at least one highly unusual move: sending Dhillon’s deputy, Michael Gates, a high-ranking political appointee, to be one of two monitors in Orange County, California.\n \n\n   \n  Gates is the former city attorney of Huntington Beach, California, and has been a vigorous proponent of voter identification laws. He also has been among the Justice Department officials seeking voter roll data from individual states — a move that has caused alarm among some state election chiefs who argue it amounts to federal overreach in elections.\n \n\n   \n  “If they want to come, it’s fine,” Bob Page, Orange County’s registrar of voters, told CNN. “Everything we do is transparent.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/europe/rome-tower-collapse-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:13:00-05:00","title":"Medieval Tower Partially Collapses in Rome, Badly Injuring One Worker and Trapping Another","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A medieval tower in Rome, the Torre dei Conti, partially collapsed during renovations, critically injuring one worker and trapping another.

in the heart of  Italy’s capital , near the famous Roman Forum ruins, partially collapsed on Monday during renovations of the structure, critically injuring one worker and trapping another, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of  tourists  watched as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti to rescue the worker who remained trapped.\n \n\n   \n  During the rescue attempt, another part of the structure partially collapsed, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly retreat.\n \n\n   \n  Firefighter spokesman Luca Cari confirmed that the one remaining worker remained trapped hours after the initial collapse. He added that a rescued worker was being treated in critical condition and that another three workers were rescued unharmed.\n \n\n   \n  The initial collapse happened some time before noon, and did not appear to have involved any bystanders.\n \n\n   \n  Queen Paglinawan was working in a nearby gelato parlor when she heard the two loud noises from the town in quick succession.\n \n\n   \n  “I was working and then I heard some like falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,” Paglinawan, 27, said as yet another collapse occurred in the background.\n \n\n   \n  German student Viktoria Braeu passed by the scene just as the partial collapse during the firefighters’ rescue occurred.\n \n\n   \n  “We were just at the Colosseum … and we were just walking to get some food. … And then we were like, ‘It’s probably not long until it’s going to go down,’ and then it just started erupting,” said Braeu, 18.\n \n\n   \n  Four firefighters later approached the first-floor window on two mobile ladders, but were quickly pulled back when dust emerged. Authorities then positioned a drone in front of the window in an apparent attempt to check the condition of the trapped worker.\n \n\n   \n  The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family.

order blocking Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Portland \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, Karina Tsui, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:52 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A judge has extended her order blocking President Donald Trump from deploying any National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, until Friday – keeping soldiers in the city in limbo as the legal showdown over presidential power continues.\n \n\n   \n  US District Court Judge Karin Immergut’s decision on Sunday followed a three-day trial that saw arguments over whether the Trump administration violated the law by federalizing and trying to deploy Oregon and California troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  The legal saga over the balance of presidential and state power has seen numerous twists and turns as it unfolded in both the district court and before appeals judges.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling comes as the Trump administration faces challenges over its power to send National Guard troops into Democratic-led cities. A federal court last month  blocked the deployment  of National Guard troops in Chicago. And last week the  Supreme Court  took the rare step of asking for additional briefing in that high-profile case.\n \n\n   \n  National Guard troops have been staging at Portland training bases for weeks while the legal case plays out, having been activated to protect federal officials and an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has been  the focal point  of daily protests since June.\n \n\n   \n  Federal attorneys have argued it’s within Trump’s presidential authority to respond to the daily protests outside the facility that have subjected the building and its agents to what it described as coordinated violence.\n \n\n   \n  But state and city attorneys called the move “one of the most significant infringements” on Oregon’s sovereignty in the state’s history and argued the Trump administration is dramatically misrepresenting the situation and risking inflaming tensions.\n \n\n   \n  The order from Immergut, a  Trump appointee  from his first term, says the federal government was unable to show the situation in Portland was out of control or federal officers were unable to do their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President’s federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,” her order reads.\n \n\n   \n    Judge says protests do not justify a National Guard deployment\n \n\n   \n  Immergut preliminarily   ruled the federal government’s deployment of the National Guard in Oregon exceeded its legal authority, violated the Tenth Amendment by infringing on state sovereignty, did not meet the legal definition of a “rebellion,” and caused ongoing constitutional harm that justified immediate judicial intervention.\n \n\n   \n  She noted the trial testimony “included evidence of sporadic isolated instances of violent behavior toward federal officers and property damage to a single building,” but those incidents do not appear to be backed by an “organized group engaged in armed hostilities for the purpose of overtaking an instrumentality of government by unlawful or antidemocratic means.”\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of violence that did occur during this time period involved violence between protesters and counter-protesters and isolated sporadic incidents of low-level unlawful conduct,” the order read.\n \n\n   \n  Oregon has argued federal agents used “disproportionate” force against demonstrators, introducing surveillance video at the trial to support the claim.\n \n\n   \n  One exhibit appeared to show an agent running into a protester at full speed from behind and knocking the person to the ground. The video, taken in August and obtained by the  Oregonian newspaper , did not show any provocation from the protester immediately before being hit.\n \n\n   \n  Another video, from October 2, showed a protester who took a step across a line marking the ICE facility property immediately rushed by more than a dozen agents and taken into custody.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on those videos. A government attorney argued at  trial  that protesters have exhibited “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 250 arrests were made or citations issued against protesters at the ICE building between early June and mid-October, according to the  FBI  and  Portland Police Bureau . It is not clear how many of those taken into custody have been charged with a crime.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a separate  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  decision allowing Trump to deploy the Oregon National Guard troops to Portland is being reconsidered “en banc” by a broader 11-judge panel.  That case revolves around a now-frozen second order from Immergut that blocked the deployment of troops from Oregon. A date for the hearing was not set.\n \n\n   \n  While  400 soldiers  from Oregon and California together were federalized and sent to the greater Portland area, a Trump administration lawyer  said  in a previous hearing before the Ninth Circuit that the administration didn’t plan to deploy more than 200.\n \n\n   \n  Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued on September 28 after Trump declared he was sending National Guard troops to the city, and Immergut’s  two temporary orders  blocking those efforts closely followed.\n \n\n   \n  Then, the three-judge Ninth Circuit panel on October 20 issued a stay on Immergut’s first restraining order — a ruling that could have paved the way for a deployment as the legal battle played out. But the decision to have a new set of appeals judges rehear the case meant that the Trump administration was still barred from deploying troops.\n \n\n   \n    Insights and surprises from the trial\n \n\n   \n  The October trial Immergut presided over featured a surprising revelation: National Guard troops were on the ground at Portland’s ICE facility earlier last month even after the judge ordered them not to show up.\n \n\n   \n  Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton argued it took time to implement the order. “My clients were working to end the mission,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The trial also provided insight on what federal and National Guard officials knew – and didn’t know – when Trump called for hundreds of troops to protect the ICE facility.\n \n\n   \n  Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, a deputy regional director for the Federal Protective Service, identified in court by the initials R.C., said.\n \n\n   \n  Testifying in court, R.C. stated he and his boss, the FPS regional director, were “surprised” by the order, which they had learned about on the news.   \n \n\n   \n  A fundamental disagreement from the trial was over how extreme the demonstrations were – and whether local law enforcement can handle them.\n \n\n   \n  State and city attorneys argued a simmering protest scene only ramped up after Trump ordered Guard troops to enter Portland in late September, and while there had been “sporadic and inexcusable crimes” along with peaceful protests, they were nothing existing law enforcement couldn’t handle.\n \n\n   \n  For months, the Trump administration has argued that federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters which justifies a more forceful response.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court. Protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence, he said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/middleeast/igaza-deceased-hostages-return-israel-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:27:00-05:00","title":"Israel receives remains of 3 more deceased hostages held in Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel received the remains of three deceased hostages taken during the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, including Omer Neutra, Asaf Hamami, and Oz Daniel.

Capt. Neutra, 21, was serving as a tank platoon commander with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) when he was killed in the initial Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Washington, Trump said he spoke to the parents of Neutra. “They’re thrilled, in one sense, but in another sense, obviously, it’s not too great, but we’re very happy to have done it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday morning, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said the other two bodies were identified as Col.

Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu accused Hamas of “pathetic attempts to deceive us, the United States, and the world. They will, of course, fail, and we will gradually bring back all our hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that Israel is still operating against “Hamas pockets” in Rafah and Khan Younis, areas that are under Israel Defense Forces (IDF) control, “and we are systematically eliminating them.”\n \n\n   \n  As the mission of returning the remaining deceased hostages draws closer to its conclusion, the IDF announced Sunday that Major General (Res.)

The hostages families regarded him as one of the most trusted figures taking part in the effort.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said the return of the hostages remains a national and moral imperative, stressing that “the mission is not complete while any deceased hostages remain in Gaza.

It’s strong enough to fell bears and soldiers \n       \n  By Maureen O'Hare, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:35 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the little wooden hut perched high on metal-wrapped stilts, the drone is high, loud and insistent.\n \n\n   \n  With his beekeeping suit on, but hands uncovered,  Hasan Kutluata   squeezes the bellows on his pine-filled bee smoker. Pale wreaths swirl in the air, mirroring the mist that drifts over the slopes of the densely forested Kaçkar mountains outside.\n \n\n   \n  The smoke is to calm the bees, masking the pheromone they release when they sense danger and which warns other bees to attack.\n \n\n   \n  When Kutluata lifts the lid off the round lindenwood hives, the hum rises to a crescendo — but these bees aren’t angry, it’s just their honey that’s mad.\n \n\n   \n  We’re here to harvest  deli bal  —  bal  means “honey” and  deli  means “crazy” or “mad” — and Turkey’s Black Sea region is one of only two places in the world to produce it, the other being Nepal’s Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain range.\n \n\n   \n  “In our untouched forests, the purple rhododendron blooms in spring,” Kutluata tells CNN. “The bees collect nectar from those flowers, and that’s how we get the mad honey.”\n \n\n   \n  The nectar contains a naturally occurring toxin called grayanotoxin. The amount that makes it into the honey varies per season and what other flowers the bees have been feasting on, but a spoonful can pack enough buzz to deliver a gently soporific high — while a jar would land you in a hospital.\n \n\n   \n  For millennia,  deli bal  has been used as folk medicine, a spoonful taken daily to lower blood pressure or used as a sexual stimulant. Today, this potentially dangerous delicacy sells at a premium price.\n \n\n   \n    The honey that defeated an army\n \n\n   \n  Kutluata uses a knife to carefully extract comb from the hive, the sticky elixir dripping thick and sweet as he gathers it in a bucket.\n \n\n   \n   Deli bal  is a dark amber red and its scent is sharp. The taste is earthy with subtle barnyard notes. There are telltale sensations that announce the presence of grayanotoxin: A herbal bitterness underlies the sweetness of the honey and a burning heat catches the back of the throat.\n \n\n   \n  Today’s honey has all the signs. “We shouldn’t eat too much. If we eat more, it might affect us,” says Kutluata. “There’s no hallucination involved. It just causes dizziness, low blood pressure, a slight fever, nausea, and difficulty walking.”\n \n\n   \n  No more than a teaspoon or tablespoon is recommended. “We have to be careful while consuming this honey,” says Kutluata. “Too much of anything is harmful. And too much honey is harmful as well.”\n \n\n   \n  This is a food that has felled armies. In the 4th century BCE, the Greek military leader  Xenophon  wrote of soldiers traveling near Trabzon on the Black Sea coast who overindulged on the sweet treat: “Not one of them could stand up, but those who had eaten a little were like people exceedingly drunk, while those who had eaten a great deal seemed like crazy, or even, in some cases, dying men. So they lay there in great numbers as though the army had suffered a defeat, and great despondency prevailed.”\n \n\n   \n    Exit, pursued by a bear\n \n\n   \n  “That’s enough for today; the bees are starting to attack,” says Kutluata, “Let’s slowly head down now.”\n \n\n   \n  Once we’re back on solid ground, the ladder goes back up to the hut so no more climbing can be done. The enemy this mini-fortress is warded against isn’t Greek armies, but honey-crazed bears.\n \n\n   \n  The metal around the poles is to prevent bears digging their claws in, and the platform’s height, some 10 feet off the ground, is to stop momma bear throwing her cub up to get the honey she can’t reach.\n \n\n   \n  Kutluata is viscerally aware of the dangers. Some 20 years after an attack, he still has scars on his hand and leg from when he fought off a bear which had raided his hives and got into a  deli bal  stupor.\n \n\n   \n  The apparently sleeping bear had roused when Kutluata and his friends approached and the ensuing chase and struggle landed Kutluata in intensive care for more than a week.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether we’re afraid of bears or not, we have to do this work,” he says. “We will continue beekeeping. We encounter bears almost every day. Whenever we go up the mountain, we come across a bear.”\n \n\n   \n  When dangerous doses of  dali bal  aren’t involved, however, “the bear doesn’t attack us. The bear runs away from us, and we run away from the bear.”\n \n\n   \n    Village of the bees\n \n\n   \n  We hop in the truck and rattle down the winding mountain tracks to Kutluata’s family home near the village of Yaylacılar, not far from Arili Köyü — the aptly named “village of the bees.”\n \n\n   \n  His parents, wife and son join us for lunch; they’re a beekeeping family of three generations. The table is set under the eaves of the traditionally styled house, with its uninhabited lower floor stacked with box beehives.\n \n\n   \n  “Our village is very cool. Summers are very cool here. There are no mosquitoes. It’s not like the city, where it’s too hot to stay,” says Kutluata. “Here, it’s a natural life. We have a river; we can go swimming. There’s no noise here.”\n \n\n   \n  The purity of the environment contributes to the quality of the honey, says his wife Emine. “What makes us different is the nature, the altitude, and the absence of settlements. That plays a huge role in the production process.”\n \n\n   \n   Deli bal  is just one of the honeys the family cultivates. After the purple rhododendron, the white chestnut flower blooms. After that, the white rhododendron is in flower.\n \n\n   \n  In summer, if the weather isn’t rainy, Kutluata’s bees can fill up a hive in about 20 days.\n \n\n   \n  “The longer the honey stays in the hive, the higher its quality becomes. The quality is determined by the promille value,” he explains. Promille refers to the concentration of the honey. “The higher the promille value, the higher the quality.”\n \n\n   \n  “Chestnut honey can be found everywhere, but it really makes a difference,” adds Emine. “In terms of the promille value, it can be 600, 700, 800, but elsewhere, it might be 500 in terms of quality.”\n \n\n   \n    Breakfast of champions\n \n\n   \n  Honey is a breakfast staple in Turkish homes and the Kutluatas show us how they mix it with butter and spread it on bread, for a hearty and high-energy start to the day.\n \n\n   \n  The food’s properties as a natural antibiotic have long been  documented ; it’s one of the world’s oldest medicines.\n \n\n   \n  To Emine, honey “represents health. If my throat is sore, I turn to honey. If I’m coughing, I turn to honey. If I’m feeling weak, I turn to honey again.”\n \n\n   \n  And to Kutluata, the bees themselves are restorative for mental health. “When I’m feeling down, I go to the bees. When I’m stressed or feeling troubled from work or the outside world, I go to the bees,” he says. “I open the hive, take care of them, and I feel peaceful and happy. And all my stress and troubles disappear.”\n \n\n   \n   Deli bal  can be sold legally in Turkey and is legal in many countries. However, the US Food and Drug Administration does not recommend its consumption.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers should check labeling of honey to ensure it is not labeled as ‘mad honey’ or marketed for intoxicating qualities,” an FDA spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Eating honey with a high amount of this toxin can lead to ‘mad honey’ poisoning, with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. This type of poisoning is rare.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/americas/venezuelans-economic-fears-us-military-action-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:59:00-05:00","title":"For many Venezuelans, economic fears trump concerns of US military action","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Venezuela, the daily struggles of poverty, healthcare access, and economic collapse have taken precedence over fears of US military action.

It’s a more pressing, personal issue: how to pay the bills.\n \n\n   \n  That same week in August, his mother Tita Carreño, 75, had an accident at home and fractured her left femur, leaving her son no option but to stop working and care for her.\n \n\n   \n  Like millions of Venezuelans, Samuel Carreño is an informal worker who lives day by day — “killing tigers,” as the local slang goes. A medical emergency is simply impossible for him to afford.\n \n\n   \n  “For the operation they were asking us for US$3,000, and we had to ask for help,” Carreño said. Thankfully, his brother managed to get that price lowered through a personal contact, and following a collection among the family, Tita was operated on 30 days later.\n \n\n   \n  But Carreño still cannot leave the house because he has to care for his bedridden mother. Every day, so she can bathe, he heats water in buckets on a gas stove because his home, where five people live, does not have a water heater. He must also be careful how much he uses because, due in part to its poor infrastructure, Venezuela rations water. Carreño’s home receives running water only three days a week when he can fill up a dozen buckets.\n \n\n   \n     It’s the economy, stupid \n \n\n   \n  For many Venezuelans, like Carreño, the daily ordeal of normal life in the country is a far more pressing concern than speculative headlines about  whether the US will or will not attack .\n \n\n   \n  According to the Central Bank, in the two months that US warships have been in the Caribbean — the same period in which Tita Carreño has been bedridden — the Venezuelan bolivar depreciated by 50% against the dollar, as people sought a safe haven in the foreign currency.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the average income of around $250 per month does not even cover half the cost of the basic food basket in the country — and the official minimum wage is just 130 bolivars per month (less than 70 cents), according to the Central Bank.\n \n\n   \n  While the Maduro government is supplementing salaries and public pensions with what it calls an “economic war bonus” (a reference to US sanctions on the country) of between $80 and $100, that doesn’t go far in a country that, according to the International Monetary Fund, has the highest inflation rate in the world: 270% for 2025 and projected to surpass 680% in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “The issue of shopping is very limited by a budgetary deficiency: You buy what you can, and rarely can you stock up,” said economist Jesús Palacios, a professor at Venezuela’s Andrés Bello Catholic University.\n \n\n   \n     Hard to speak out \n \n\n   \n  While many Venezuelans are open about their economic concerns, gauging their feelings in response to the US military deployment is far harder. The country has a history of censorship and political oppression that makes many people wary of commenting publicly.\n \n\n   \n  One sign that censorship is increasing came Tuesday, when Maduro ordered authorities to adapt a mobile phone app currently used to report failures in public services, so that people could use it to inform on other citizens voicing dissent against the government.\n \n\n   \n  Sharing such opinions in Venezuela can be very costly.\n \n\n   \n  On October 8, Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello announced the arrest on Margarita Island of photographer Carlos Lesma, who was accused of writing “welcome to the gringos” on social media sites in reference to the possibility of a US military invasion.\n \n\n   \n  Lesma is one of more than 750 Venezuelans imprisoned for political reasons, according to the latest count by the   human-rights organization Foro Penal — though the Venezuelan government has repeatedly denied that these detentions are arbitrary.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 100 foreign prisoners are also believed to be held for political reasons, according to Foro Penal.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most striking of these cases is that of Jonathan Torres, a 25-year-old Venezuelan citizen who emigrated in 2015 as a minor to settle in the United States with his family. He returned to Venezuela last year by land.\n \n\n   \n  According to Torres’ mother and lawyers, he was detained in October 2024 and held incommunicado before being brought before the courts on charges of terrorism, criminal association and treason.\n \n\n   \n  But they believe the real reason for his detention is that the Maduro regime wants to use him as a bargaining chip with Washington. His mother, Rhoda Torres, first learned he was being held when another US citizen detained in Venezuela, David Estrella, was released alongside five others earlier this year following high-level negotiations between the White House and Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “They wanted to exchange him, just like all the other gringos. When they realized he wasn’t from the US and that they messed up, they still kept him there because he could be used in a swap,” Rhoda Torres told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out the Venezuelan Attorney General’s Office for information about Torres’ case and has not received a response.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the risks, Rhoda Torres campaigns openly for her son’s release, sharing videos on social media that have been watched tens of thousands of times.\n \n\n   \n  “They say not to publicize the cases, that you have to be careful, but it’s a lie: Notoriety is our only defense,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Relatives of other political detainees are often more fearful and agree to speak only on the condition of anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  “Having a family member as a political prisoner is hell,” said another woman, whose nephew has been held since September 2023, according to a document reviewed by CNN. He has not been brought before a court or charged, lawyers and relatives said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether she is afraid of what would happen if the Venezuelan government were overthrown by force, the detainee’s aunt said: “Afraid of what? Sooner or later a war will end, while for me the fear is to be here forever, or for our allied countries to leave us alone in the fight.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/pammukale-hot-springs-turkey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:22:00-05:00","title":"The magical white stone wonderland with effervescent bathing pools","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pamukkale, a stunning natural wonder in southwestern Turkey composed of white travertine terraces formed by thermal water deposits, is renowned for its beauty and historical significance.

effervescent bathing pools \n       \n  By Barry Neild, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:22 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  From a distance, Pamukkale looks every bit like a ski resort, with a cascade of brilliant white slopes and a scattering of tourists at the top, seemingly preparing to slalom down into the valley below.\n \n\n   \n  So why isn’t it melting away as midsummer temperatures nudge toward 100 Fahrenheit, or 37 Celsius, and the heat hangs in the shimmering air?\n \n\n   \n  Because this unusual and beautiful wonder, located deep in the sunkissed hills of southwestern Turkey, isn’t snow at all. In fact the water it’s formed from sometimes spurts out of the ground at boiling point.\n \n\n   \n  And those visitors milling around its upper reaches aren’t going anywhere fast. Most are here to take in the extraordinary spectacle — and either paddle or soak in some of the planet’s most photogenic pools.\n \n\n   \n  Today, Pamukkale’s travertine limestone slopes and pools, filled with milky blue mineral water, are perfect for Instagram moments, especially as the magic hour evening sun casts their rippled surfaces in hues of pink.\n \n\n   \n    Gateway to Hell\n \n\n   \n  But this place was a tourist sensation thousands of years before social media, as first Greeks, then Romans flocked here for the thermal waters and to pay tribute at what was revered as a gateway to Hell.\n \n\n   \n  Today, Pamukkale and the ancient city of Hierapolis, which sprawls across the plateau above the white terraces, are part of a UNESCO World Heritage site that pulls in busloads of visitors. Typically, many visit for a couple of hours, but it’s worth spending at least a day in this geological and historical playground.\n \n\n   \n  Enter from the South Gate — tickets cost 30 euros (about $33) — and it’s easy to be initially underwhelmed. There’s not much to see right away apart from a few toppled ancient columns, which are a frequent sight around this part of Turkey.\n \n\n   \n  In truth, the site of Hierapolis and Pamukkale is huge, so it takes a while to reach the good stuff (golf carts can be rented for those really pressed for time or unable to walk the distances here). But it also means that the big reveal, when it comes, is even better.\n \n\n   \n  After 10 minutes of strolling along paved pathways from the gate, the line of trees that marks the edge of the plateau comes into sight. Even if you know what’s coming, there’s still a wow factor when you finally reach it, and the spectacle of that white landscape is revealed.\n \n\n   \n  Over millennia, the calcite deposited by the thermal water sputtering out of the ground has reshaped this hillside, creating white terraces that give the area its name — Pamukkale means “cotton castle” in Turkish.\n \n\n   \n  These terraces once held myriad naturally formed blue pools. Most of these are now empty of water and off-limits, leading to some complaints that the site no longer lives up to photographs that show it in years gone by.\n \n\n   \n  “It is pretty, but there’s not as much water as I’d expected,” says Mary Huang, a tourist from Guangzhou in southern China, posing for a photograph on the edge of one of the pools. “The view is gorgeous though.”\n \n\n   \n    Serene pools\n \n\n   \n  There’s still an impressive series of serene pools, which cascade down the hill. It’s a fun spot for paddling or lying down in shallow waters and mud said to have therapeutic properties.\n \n\n   \n  To explore the terraces, visitors need to remove their footwear. The rock is uncomfortable and slippery in places, but it doesn’t take long to reach the first in the series of pools where toes sink into soft sediment.\n \n\n   \n  The top terraces are the busiest, but for those willing to make their way farther down, there’s every chance of grabbing a pool to themselves.\n \n\n   \n  DJ Tiz, a South Korean music producer on a road trip across Turkey with his partner, singer Fre Naz, is among those slapping mud all over, under the watchful eye of an amicable dog. Having already sampled plenty of the country’s stunning landscapes, he declares: “I love Pamukkale the best.”\n \n\n   \n  For a more complete spa experience, there’s the Antique Pool, about five minutes’ walk from the top of the terraces. Here, for a small extra fee, visitors can use changing rooms and bathe and swim in crystal clear thermal waters over the toppled ruins of an ancient temple to Apollo.\n \n\n   \n  Better still, as you near the source of the water, in one corner of the pool, it becomes filled with tiny, fizzing bubbles — it’s like swimming in warm Champagne or soda. The water is said to offer relief to skin, cardiovascular and rheumatic complaints. Drinking from a water pump here is also said to work for digestive conditions.\n \n\n   \n    Noxious fumes\n \n\n   \n  You can spend hours wandering around the remains of Hierapolis – high spots include the wide 2nd century agora marketplace, the magnificent Roman theater and the tombs of the necropolis.\n \n\n   \n  The size of the site reveals the city’s one-time power and popularity (it even rates a  namecheck in the Bible  alongside another nearby ruined city, Laodicea, which is also worth a visit). Much of Hierapolis’ status was derived from the geothermal forces lurking beneath its surface.\n \n\n   \n  While many of the Romans and Greeks who came to the city were undoubtedly here for the warm waters, the place had great religious significance as the site of a Plutonium cave, or entrance to Hell.\n \n\n   \n  Here, much to the amazement of onlookers, sacrificial animals such as bulls would drop dead after breathing in noxious carbon dioxide fumes swirling up from below. The priests, who led them in would emerge unscathed, having learned to hold their breath.\n \n\n   \n  Today, the Plutonium — located between the Ancient Pool and the Roman theater — is another high point on the tour of Hierapolis, and one of many places in the city worth visiting in the cooler evenings when, after nightfall, some attractions are dramatically illuminated.\n \n\n   \n  While Pamukkale is enjoying more modern fame thanks to its photogenic appearance in social media posts, some locals lament the changing nature of tourism to the area.\n \n\n   \n  Ali Durmuş, who runs Pamukkale-based tour company Turkey Magic Travel, says the roping off of much of the travertines and diversion of water since it became a UNESCO World Heritage site has robbed visitors of an experience enjoyed for millennia. He says it puts them off staying longer.\n \n\n   \n  Pammukale’s  UNESCO listing  led to on-site hotels being demolished, new pools constructed, water redirected down manmade channels, improved site management and closure of the slopes to reverse degradation that had changed them from white to gray.\n \n\n   \n  “If they cannot enjoy the water, then they are not staying long. Maybe one night or just visiting for an afternoon,” Durmuş says.\n \n\n   \n  He worries that the diminished experience has meant people miss out on exploring the surrounding area, which has other geothermal attractions. Towns stretching out northwest from Pamukkale along a geological fault line tap into increasingly hotter supplies of steam and water surging up from underground.\n \n\n   \n  About 20 minutes’ drive northwest up the surrounding Denizli Basin, the town of Karahayit has spas and heating systems based around the iron-rich red waters that emerge at around 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). The town also has a lovely covered market, with street vendors selling delicious local mulberry juice.\n \n\n   \n  Farther away, in Buharkent — its name meaning “steam city” — water at boiling point powers what was Turkey’s first geothermal power station.\n \n\n   \n  In winter, it has been known to sometimes get chilly enough to snow in Pamukkale, but thanks to the primal forces that thrust up from its hellish subterranean portals and paint the hillsides white, it’s always a hot destination.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/uk/uk-train-attack-wwk-intl-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:35:00-05:00","title":"British man charged over mass stabbing attack on a train in England","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A British man, Anthony Williams, 32, from Peterborough, has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm, and one count of possession of a bladed article in connection with a mass stabbing attack on a London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train in Cambridgeshire on Saturday, November 1, 2025.

While in court, he wasn’t asked to enter pleas and he said “no fixed abode” when he was asked about his address, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency. His next appearance in court is due to be on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  He is further charged with one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of bladed article in connection to the mass stabbing in Cambridgeshire, according to BTP.\n \n\n   \n  The man is also charged with another count of attempted murder in connection with a separate incident that happened earlier on Saturday at Pontoon Dock Station in London.\n \n\n   \n  Three more incidents believed to be linked to the attacker took place in Peterborough on Friday evening and Saturday morning, according to Cambridgeshire police. One of those included a stabbing in Peterborough city center, in which a 14-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive but previously said that there was no evidence to suggest the attacks were terror-related.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the stabbing on the train.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train departed from the northern city of Doncaster at 6:25 p.m. local time on Saturday, bound for London.\n \n\n   \n  The train had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place.\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  After seeing more people running past, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get (as) far down the train as they can.”\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train restrooms, said other witnesses who saw train seats soaked in blood.\n \n\n   \n  Cambridgeshire police received their first emergency call at approximately 7:39 p.m. local time and immediately deployed armed officers. Within about 11 minutes of the call, two initial suspects were arrested after the train made an unplanned stop at Huntingdon station. One of those suspects was later released.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  The train remained at Huntingdon station Sunday morning, with medical equipment and other debris seen strewn on the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Police had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before rescinding it later.\n \n\n   \n  “Our investigation is also looking at other possible linked offences,” Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Cundy of the British Transport Police said in a statement Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Williams was charged with another count of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article in connection to another incident on Saturday at Pontoon Dock station in London, which is about 100 miles from Peterborough.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the victims?\n \n\n   \n  A total of 11 victims received treatment in hospital. Ten people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, nine of whom were in life-threatening condition, while another person later self-presented that evening.\n \n\n   \n  As of Sunday evening, one person remains in hospital in life-threatening condition, BTP said. The man, an LNER staff member who was on the train, had “tried to stop the attacker,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  “Detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said on Monday that five people were still in the hospital, including the train crew member who is in a “critical but stable condition.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the victims still in the hospital is Scunthorpe United player Jonathan Gjoshe, the soccer club said in a statement, which said he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about other victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n  Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding.\n \n\n   \n    How common are such attacks in the UK?\n \n\n   \n  The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, knife crime has risen overall since 2011. Some 51,527 knife crime offenses were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Of those, 15,689 were recorded in London.\n \n\n   \n  British politicians and other key figures expressed their shock at Saturday’s attack and offered their condolences to victims.\n \n\n   \n  “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” Starmer wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line – on which the train was traveling – is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-shutdown-2025-elections-obamacare-tariffs-scotus-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:35:00-05:00","title":"An epochal political week opens with shutdown about to break record","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A prolonged government shutdown in the United States, now in its 34th day and approaching a record length, has created widespread public suffering, including millions of Americans losing pay, health care, and food assistance. The crisis stems from a political standoff between Senate Democrats, who sought to force Republicans into negotiating over the extension of Obamacare subsidies, and Republicans, led by President Donald Trump, who resisted such talks. Trump has escalated the situation by demanding the elimination of the Senate filibuster to reopen the government, risking long-term political consequences. The shutdown has also led to public backlash, with Trump’s approval rating dropping to 37% and growing bipartisan criticism over the administration’s handling of the crisis.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump’s tariff policies, and ongoing controversies over extrajudicial strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific raise constitutional concerns.

political week opens with shutdown about to break record \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:35 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A defining week has dawned in American politics with huge implications for Donald Trump’s second presidency, for his fellow Republicans and for a Democratic Party seeking to build a new future from the ashes of its 2024 election humiliation.\n \n\n   \n  The government shutdown is now in its 34th day and less than 48 hours from becoming the longest ever. But none of the political stakes compare to the misery of millions of Americans now struggling to get by on $0 paychecks, or who risk losing health care or vital food assistance.\n \n\n   \n  “It feels as if the government doesn’t care. The holidays are coming — people are going to be hungry. We are the land of opportunity, and it doesn’t look like it,” Janis, a federal worker, who is the daughter and granddaughter of military veterans, told CNN’s Camila DeChalus at  a food bank in suburban Maryland .\n \n\n   \n  Trump seems oblivious to political appearances or the risk that the shutdown could further damage him among most Americans who have soured on his second term. Creating an impression of gilded indifference, he hosted a “Great Gatsby”-themed  Halloween party  at his luxury Florida club and  boasted about  the swish renovation of a bathroom at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  In a combative interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Trump showed no sign of looking for a way out that did not involve a total defeat for Democrats, whom he described as “crazed lunatics.” He said the opposition party would eventually “have to” capitulate and vote to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  The president has complicated GOP calculations by  renewing demands  for reluctant Senate Republicans to shatter  the chamber’s filibuster rule  to reopen the government with a simple majority vote. GOP leaders fear this would embolden a future Democratic majority.\n \n\n   \n  “The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We’re not going to lose power,” Trump said on “60 Minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s embittered politics, which set the stage for the Washington shutdown disaster, will take a fresh twist with a handful of  key elections Tuesday , which could help resolve the impasse. Or perhaps they’ll just deepen the morass.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will deliver the first major verdict on Trump’s second term in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats lead in the polls. The New York mayor’s race could enshrine democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as an electric new talent in a party split between wariness of his politics and enthusiasm over his youth. A victory for Mamdani over the old guard of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo would also hand a new foil to Trump, who paints the 34-year-old as the far-left face of his rival party.\n \n\n   \n  In California, meanwhile, voters will decide whether to redraw the congressional map to  favor Democrats in a clutch of seats , in response to Trump’s similar moves  in Texas and elsewhere  ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Their endorsement would be a huge boost for  California Gov. Gavin Newsom , who is claiming a national leadership role ahead of a likely run for president in 2028.\n \n\n   \n  The elections and the deepening pain over the shutdown, set off on October 1 by Senate Democrats in a bid to force Republicans to  extend Obamacare subsidies , will play out against the daily backdrop of chaos and extremes of the second Trump era. The Supreme Court on Wednesday will  hear arguments  over Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs that started a global trade war. The justices’ eventual decision could set up a showdown with the executive branch or confirm Trump’s claim of emergency powers in yet another vast expansion of presidential authority.\n \n\n   \n  The same underlying question — of whether Trump is illegally acting on powers he’s not granted by the Constitution — underpins an escalating crisis over the administration’s strikes against what it claims are drug traffickers’ boats in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Critics accuse the administration of carrying out extrajudicial killings and breaking the law by acting without congressional consent. The White House has offered no proof or justification to the American people for its actions, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has banned subordinates from  discussing the strikes with Congress  without prior approval.\n \n\n   \n  There were new signs Monday that Trump’s approach in his wild second presidency is backfiring. A new CNN/SSRS poll found the president’s approval rating is at 37%, the lowest level of his second term so far. And the country is in a sour mood, which might benefit Democrats if only they could settle on a message that has public appeal. In the poll, 68% of people say things are going badly in the country, while 72% say the economy is in poor shape.\n \n\n   \n    Shutdown misery deepens as record approaches\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, pressure on both parties to end the shutdown is becoming visceral.\n \n\n   \n  The reality of rising health care premiums for those with Affordable Care Act policies struck home with  the start of open enrollment Saturday . Premiums were already set to rise significantly because of the costs of care and drugs. But the expiration of subsidies means prices are shooting out of the reach of many policyholders. This is why Democrats sought to use the only leverage they had in Washington — the ability to block most legislation in the Senate — to force a showdown to coerce Republicans into action.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to make sure that we can decisively address the Republican health care crisis, which is crushing people all across the country,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  If the dispute was only about health care, Democrats might have  claimed victory  by now.\n \n\n   \n  But by closing the government, they precipitated the furloughing of millions of federal employees as others were forced to work without pay. This has led to  the potential cutoff of food stamps  to more than 40 million people and is disrupting air travel  as Thanksgiving looms .\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accuse Trump of withholding emergency funding they say could partially finance food stamps for this month, claims that have been validated by several federal judges.\n \n\n   \n  But the extreme disruption and costs of the shutdown are scrambling normal political calculations and may mean no party earns a clear-cut win. “It’s very unfortunate that Donald Trump and Republicans have decided to weaponize hunger and withhold SNAP benefits,” Jeffries told Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Yet House Speaker Mike Johnson pointed out that the broader deprivation caused by the shutdown would not have occurred had Democrats agreed to GOP demands to reopen the government ahead of talks on Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how they can believe they’re winning, if it were indeed a game to them,” Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday.” The Louisiana Republican said Trump was “desperate” to reopen the government and had offered negotiations. The sticking point, however, is the Republican demand for the government to reopen so talks can happen — and the Democrat belief that such offers cannot be trusted.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said on “60 Minutes” that he was ready to fix the Obamacare subsidies problem. “We should fix that. Fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats,” he said. “All they have to do is let the country open and we’ll fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  But the president, as has been the case across his two terms, did not lay out any detailed plan for making health care more affordable.\n \n\n   \n    Senators still seeking off-ramp\n \n\n   \n  Some Democratic and Republican senators have been speaking informally about a device to fund the government in the short term. But Trump’s demands to eradicate the filibuster suggest he’s got no plans to back down. This hints at what is different in this shutdown. The president has proved that he’s ready to impose pain on anyone to fulfill his political goals and that the normal logic of shutdown politics may not apply. While Democratic voters are demanding their party shows backbone against Trump, their leaders must work out a way to create an off-ramp that would allow them to claim victory.\n \n\n   \n  Warning signs are also mounting for Trump and Republicans. New polls show that the Democrats’ top demand — extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies — is popular. And in a Washington Post-ABC News poll Thursday, voters blamed Trump and the GOP more than Democrats for the shutdown by 45%-33%. The president’s approval rating is only 41% in the  CNN Poll of Polls  average.\n \n\n   \n  But public disdain for Democrats is complicating the party’s effort to exploit Trump’s troubles. Some 68% of people in the Post poll thought the party was out of touch with most Americans. And a CBS News poll found 56% disapproved of Trump’s handling of the shutdown, while 55% said the same of how congressional Democrats and Republicans are responding to the situation.\n \n\n   \n  One warning sign for Democrats is that they are being effectively forced by Trump’s hardline tactics to balance the pain of citizens who risk losing health care against the suffering of those who could lose nutrition benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman wants to reopen the government so health care and food assistance crises can be addressed. “I fully, fully support these things, but this is the wrong tactic,” Fetterman said on “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  “And right now, by doing this, our government shut down, we’re getting neither of those things, and they guarantee neither you’re going to get your SNAP benefits, and you’re not going to get those kind of tax credits that we all need,” Fetterman continued. “Reopen this thing, and we can find a way forward.”\n \n\n   \n    How will Tuesday’s election shift shutdown drama?\n \n\n   \n  One intriguing question this week would be whether a Democratic sweep in New Jersey, Virginia, New York and the California redistricting initiative would reshape Republican shutdown tactics. Republicans might panic only a year ahead of the midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson, who will lose his job as speaker if Democrats win back the House next year, insisted on Sunday that the impasse could end because the opposition party would no longer need to use it as an issue as voters make their decisions. “We do have a sense that something may change next week,” he told the Republican Jewish Coalition leadership summit during a virtual appearance Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  But a rank-and-file Republican warned Sunday his party must make health care more affordable once the government is reopened. “The midterms are going to be a whole lot harder if Republicans just sit there and say, ‘We’re just going to let it (the enhanced subsidies) lapse. We’re not going to do anything,’” Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey told CNN’s Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.”\n \n\n   \n  The cost of living has shaped campaigning ahead of Tuesday’s elections, along with Trump’s perceived excesses. “Virginia voters can and will send a message amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington,” Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in New Jersey branded GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli as a tool of Trump. But outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is also unpopular, and  Ciattarelli called for change  in a state that has sometimes chosen GOP governors.\n \n\n   \n   Former President Barack Obama  on Saturday campaigned in both states, confirming his status as one of the few A-list national Democrats — but also the party’s desperate need to find new voices.\n \n\n   \n  He told voters in Norfolk, Virginia, that the stakes were clear. “We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don’t need to wonder about whether vulnerable people are going to be hurt, or ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. We’ve witnessed it. Elections do matter,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/health/fda-tidmarsh-resigns","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"08:09:00-05:00","title":"FDA’s top drug regulator resigns after federal officials probe ‘serious concerns’ about his conduct","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dr. George Tidmarsh, the head of the FDA’s drug center, resigned abruptly after federal officials raised 'serious concerns about his personal conduct.'

Tidmarsh then resigned Sunday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Kennedy expects the highest ethical standards from all individuals serving under his leadership and remains committed to full transparency,” Hilliard said.\n \n\n   \n  The departure came the same day that a drugmaker connected to one of Tidmarsh’s former business associates filed a lawsuit alleging that he made “false and defamatory statements,” during his time at the FDA.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit, brought by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, alleges that Tidmarsh used his FDA position to pursue a “longstanding personal vendetta” against the chair of the company’s board of directors, Kevin Tang.\n \n\n   \n  Tang previously served as a board member of several drugmakers where Tidmarsh was an executive, including La Jolla Pharmaceutical, and was involved in his ouster from those leadership positions, according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Messages placed to Tidmarsh and his lawyer were not immediately returned late Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Tidmarsh founded and led a series of pharmaceutical companies over several decades working in California’s pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Before joining the FDA, he also served as an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He was recruited to join the agency over the summer after meeting with FDA Commissioner  Marty Makary .\n \n\n   \n  Tidmarsh’s ouster is the latest in a string of haphazard leadership changes at the agency, which has been rocked for months by firings, departures and controversial decisions on  vaccines ,  fluoride  and  other products .\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Vinay Prasad, who oversees FDA’s vaccine and biologics center, resigned in July after coming under fire from conservative activists close to President Donald Trump, only to rejoin the agency two weeks later at the behest of Health Secretary  Robert F. Kennedy Jr .\n \n\n   \n  The FDA’s drug center, which Tidmarsh oversaw, has lost more than 1,000 staffers over the past year to layoffs or resignations, according to agency figures. The center is the largest division of the FDA and is responsible for the review, safety and quality control of prescription and over-the-counter medicines.\n \n\n   \n  In September, Tidmarsh drew public attention for a highly unusual post on LinkedIn stating that one of Aurinia Pharmaceutical’s products, a kidney drug, had “not been shown to provide a direct clinical benefit for patients.” It’s very unusual for an FDA regulator to single out individual companies and products in public comments online.\n \n\n   \n  According to the company’s lawsuit, Aurinia’s stock dropped 20% shortly after the post, wiping out more than $350 million in shareholder value.\n \n\n   \n  Tidmarsh later deleted the LinkedIn post and said he had posted it in his personal capacity, not as an FDA official.\n \n\n   \n  Aurinia’s lawsuit also alleges, among other things, that Tidmarsh used his post at FDA to target a type of thyroid drug made by another company, American Laboratories, where Tang also serves as board chair.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court of Maryland, seeks compensatory and punitive damages and “to set the record straight,” according to the company.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/europe/louvre-heist-petty-criminals-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"06:49:00-05:00","title":"Louvre heist suspects are local petty criminals, Paris prosecutor says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major heist on October 19, 2025, four suspects—three men and one woman—broke into the Apollo Gallery at the Louvre museum in Paris using a truck-mounted ladder.

Mamdani is a 34-year-old democratic socialist, the Uganda-born son of a university professor and filmmaker, who sprung to stardom with a focus on cost of living conveyed in buzzy, multilingual videos pushing for government to pay for more.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t a sitcom pitch: It reflects   a party still deep in figuring out what it’s supposed to be and how it’s supposed to appeal to voters.\n \n\n   \n  Heading into Tuesday’s elections, Democrats are far from resolving the schism between progressives and moderates that  undermined them in last year’s presidential race . But many in the party are fearful of being tied to Mamdani’s  democratic socialism  or  anti-Israel views  even as they buzz about his  breakthrough communications  and the passion he has inspired.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger is clear about her differences with Mamdani. She spoke to CNN on Friday on her campaign bus, leaving   an event in Ashland, Virginia, where the woman who introduced her said sometimes she feels she’s the only Democrat in the area.\n \n\n   \n  “Why is it that everybody keeps thinking somebody running in a city, admittedly an enormous city, that  that  is the deciding race?” she asked.\n \n\n   \n  When asked what she made of Mamdani declaring at an  October rally in Manhattan  that he had already won the battle over the soul of the Democratic Party, Spanberger’s mouth twitched into a smile.\n \n\n   \n  “Then maybe,” she said, “he should be a Democrat.”\n \n\n   \n  Acknowledging when pressed that Mamdani is in fact the Democratic nominee, Spanberger said that for all the talk — including from within the  Democratic Socialists of America itself  — about the DSA’s growing power, she doesn’t see democratic socialism on the rise.\n \n\n   \n  She argues there’s a level of dishonesty in some of the big promises Mamdani is making that she worries could hurt Democrats with voters long term, saying the reason she doesn’t have a Mamdani-style proposal for  government-run grocery stores  is “because I couldn’t ever pass it.”\n \n\n   \n  “People do want us to be aspirational and dream big. They also don’t want us to lie to them,” she told CNN. “When you have a party that makes promise after promise, and then say, ‘Oh, we passed it in the House, it’s not our fault’ — vulnerable people believed you. Maybe he is going to get Albany on board with totally refinancing public transportation. But there’s a lot of people who believe him.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s campaign did not respond when asked about Spanberger’s comments. But asked at an event on Friday about whether he wants Democrats to have room for more moderate campaigns in Virginia and New Jersey, where US Rep. Mikie Sherrill is running with a similar approach to Spanberger’s, Mamdani was conciliatory.\n \n\n   \n  “Absolutely, I think that this has to be a party that actually allows Americans to see themselves in it and not just be a mirror image of just a few people who are engaged in politics,” he said. “To me, what binds all of us together is who we are fighting to serve, and that is working people.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger argued that many polls show her more likely to break 50% in her state than Mamdani is in his city.\n \n\n   \n  She’s facing a Republican who  failed to win Trump’s endorsement  and who faced GOP criticism over her campaign. He’s in a three-way race, but Mamdani and his close advisers are focused on the 50% mark themselves —for what kind of mandate he’ll be able to claim both for his agenda and the broader direction he wants to set for the party.\n \n\n   \n    Can both visions co-exist?\n \n\n   \n  Mayoral races in New York don’t usually have national implications. That was before the shocker out of this year’s primary as Mamdani went from 1% in the polls to knocking off former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in his political comeback. Now New York City has the marquee race, with Mamdani trying to consolidate Democrats and defeat Cuomo’s independent run appealing to Trump supporters and moderates.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Ro Khanna, a Silicon Valley congressman and former Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair, is the only Democrat known to be considering a 2028 run who’s campaigned with Spanberger, Sherrill and Mamdani, as well as supporters of the Democratic-led redistricting effort in California.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s mind-boggling to me that we don’t have more people recognizing” the importance of how much Mamdani has electrified young voters and beyond, Khanna told CNN. He added that he hopes national Democrats also recognize how Spanberger pitched herself to rural counties and Sherrill to the suburbs.\n \n\n   \n  They fit together, Khanna said, in that Democrats are “rejecting the status quo and saying we need a fresh generation of leaders and saying, ‘We’re not going to define our identity around Donald Trump.’”\n \n\n   \n  But the Democratic leaders plotting next year’s campaigns say Mamdani won’t be their blueprint.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters in the Arizonas or the Iowas aren’t thinking about who the mayor of New York might be. They’re thinking about who’s going to understand the issues facing our community and going to fight to make a difference back in Washington, DC,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington state congresswoman and chair of the House Democrats’ campaign arm. “It is hard to draw conclusions from a bright blue city versus look at what it’s like in purple districts where you have just that huge diversity, in terms of points of view and different issues.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether she’s thought about New York City as she looks at this year’s gubernatorial contests and the 36 races looming next year, Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Meghan Meehan-Draper told CNN, “Not really.”\n \n\n   \n  “I understand why there’s attention on it — but at a moment when our party’s struggling and our brand is struggling, if you want to be a party that wins, gets results and is popular in the eyes of voters, you should look to Democratic governors,” Meehan-Draper said.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill —  a personal friend  of Spanberger’s who keeps up with her on the campaign trail via text — tends to respond to questions about Mamdani by pointing out that she won her own primary by a big margin with a field that included candidates closer aligned to Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “New Jerseyans want competence — they want someone who is going to attack prices, someone who is listening to their concerns,” she told CNN’s John Berman recently.\n \n\n   \n  And when CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday asked House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries whether he thought Mamdani was the future of the party, the New York Democrat responded, “No.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s response to Jeffries hours later: “That’s good to know.”\n \n\n   \n    Spanberger crafts her own blueprint\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger’s mode isn’t Mamdani’s big-smile charisma. She knows that her buttons and T-shirts haven’t become a political fashion statement. But she says she’s tired of people saying she’s not exciting. Along with Sherrill, she helped flip the US House to Democratic control during Trump’s first term. She got bills signed by Joe Biden and Donald Trump — “that is not easy to do,” Obama joked while  rallying for her  Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  A year after some panicked Democrats declared after Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump that women can’t win, operatives beyond New York have joked that maybe the answer is just slightly younger women who are moms and, given Spanberger’s CIA work and Sherrill’s time as a Navy   helicopter pilot, were maybe involved with killing some people.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger laughed at that suggestion, but said what people read into her biography helped her tap into a moment with parallels to when she first won in the post-Trump midterms — but with key differences.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t even call it the resistance anymore. People have matured in their advocacy,” she said, arguing that while 2017 was defined by protests of a growing base nearly every weekend, now there are clearer, starker stakes and “layers of people who were not anywhere in play in ’17, who are in some cases leading the charges in their communities to make differences.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and his aides say that feeling of people left out of politics for so long is exactly what he’s tapping into.\n \n\n   \n  “Too long we’ve been told that we should wait,” he said Saturday in Queens, but “to wait would be to trust who gave us this moment, who delivered us to it.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s part of why Mamdani and his advisers bristle so much at those who write him off as a great campaigner with a great production team.\n \n\n   \n  “The style is downstream from the substance,” Andrew Epstein, his communications director through the primary and now his digital director, told CNN in an earlier interview. “Unless you have a message and an agenda that is directly relevant to people’s lives, that speaks to the economic conditions in this country, that credibly presents itself as an alternative to this incredibly broken status quo and the alienation that so many people feel from mainstream politics, it’s not going to work.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ruben Gallego, who ran well ahead of Harris last year in his swing state of Arizona to win his seat, said he felt comfortable campaigning just for Spanberger and Sherrill.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think Mamdani could win in Arizona, I don’t think I could win New York City, but it doesn’t mean that some of this stuff is also wrong. He cares about the cost of living like many of us; we just take different approaches to it,” Gallego told CNN after finishing speaking at a Mexican restaurant in Alexandria for Spanberger.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats “have always been that way,” Gallego said. “Look at the Republicans, look at those weirdos, man. They have a weird span of things.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/health/autism-inclusive-communities-conversation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00+00:00","title":"How autism rates are rising – and why that could lead to more inclusive communities","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the rising autism diagnosis rates in the U.S., particularly from 1 in 36 in 2023 to 1 in 31 by age 8 in 2025, as reported by the CDC.

\nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  I can say from personal experience that being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder can feel very isolating. Increasingly, however, it’s not unusual.\n \n\n   \n  In the U.S.,  1 in 31 children are diagnosed with autism  each year by age 8, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number, released in April 2025, is up from 1 in 36 in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  These statistics have been  widely characterized as concerning . But I would like to offer a different perspective.\n \n\n   \n  I am a researcher studying how young people with autism  transition to adulthood . I also work on the  Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network , which was established by the CDC two decades ago to determine the prevalence of autism in the U.S. and which produced the 2025 report.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, this topic is  deeply personal  to me, since I am diagnosed with  Asperger’s syndrome, now known as autism spectrum disorder .\n \n\n   \n  While autism does present challenges, my professional and personal experiences have taught me that creating space for autistic people’s perspectives affords opportunities for  making the world a more vibrant place .\n \n\n   \n    A rare condition?\n \n\n   \n  Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental condition that manifests differently from person to person but commonly affects how a person  communicates, socializes and interacts with the world .\n \n\n   \n  In the 1990s, researchers and clinicians estimated that autism was a relatively rare condition,  affecting an estimated 1 in 500 children . But the real-world experiences of families and clinicians suggested that it was  more common .\n \n\n   \n   Read more:  Autism charities can portray autistic people as helpless and a burden – our research shows why it matters \n \n\n   \n  In a landmark study published in 1998, researchers examined autism prevalence in a community in New Jersey to determine a more realistic estimate in the U.S. population. They found that approximately  1 in 150 children had autism  – making it more than three times more common than previously believed.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in 2000, the newly formed Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, which set out to study autism among 8-year-olds, looked across a much broader population and  confirmed the higher prevalence .\n \n\n   \n    A growing recognition\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the number of children recognized as having autism by a doctor or an education specialist has continued to rise. The 2025 report shows that  autism occurs in all types of communities . Autism affects children regardless of race, ethnicity or income level.\n \n\n   \n  Autism prevalence does vary by location, though. It is highest in California, where it is recognized in around 1 in 19 children, and lowest in Texas, where the prevalence ranges from around 1 in 103 to 1 in 51 children. In Arizona, where I live and work, the prevalence is around 1 in 32, which is very close to the CDC’s overall nationwide estimate.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers believe that this wide geographic variability in autism prevalence  reflects complex interactions  between community awareness and acceptance, the availability of clinical and education services in schools and communities that serve people with autism, broader culture acceptance of mental health challenges, and other societal factors.\n \n\n   \n  The number of autism diagnoses also varies by gender. One well-known feature of autism is that it affects boys more often than girls. In the late 1990s and early 2000s,  four boys for every one girl  was diagnosed with autism. This  disparity persisted   for many   years . But now, it seems to be shrinking: In the May 2025 data, the  ratio for boys versus girls is 3.4 to 1 .\n \n\n   \n  This shift reflects the growing understanding  that autism looks different in girls  than in boys, which in turn allows clinicians to accurately identify it in girls in larger numbers.\n \n\n   \n    From recognition to acceptance\n \n\n   \n   Research shows, however , that this increase in autism diagnoses is not something to fear.\n \n\n   \n  While some children diagnosed with autism are  profoundly affected  and require significant support, many others successfully engage in everyday activities like school, sports and work. One 2022 study found that a majority of children reported as having autism by their parents  expect to attend college . This suggests that many people diagnosed with autism feel they are capable of living full and productive lives.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, understanding the patterns of autism prevalence does not explain why it occurs in the first place. Research suggests that  genes are a major cause of autism . But many things have changed over the past several decades since researchers and clinicians began tracking autism occurrence. For example,  the criteria clinicians use to diagnose autism  have changed over time to  become less restrictive .\n \n\n   \n   Read more:  Why some autistic people don’t speak \n \n\n   \n  Today, a wider variety of symptoms are included in the diagnostic definition of autism spectrum disorder than when autism was first introduced as a  mental health condition in 1980 .\n \n\n   \n  Another change is that autism is much more widely accepted in society than it was just a decade ago. For example,  autistic characters are often portrayed in media  as protagonists that the audience is cheering for. This growing recognition and acceptance is associated with an  increase in self-diagnosis of autism .\n \n\n   \n    Building richer communities\n \n\n   \n  While autistic people tend to have  some unique challenges , including repetitive behaviors, restricted interests and social communication difficulties, they also have particular strengths, such as  creative, out-of-the-box thinking . For me, this includes seeing connections that others miss.\n \n\n   \n  Autistic people report that their  unique perspective offers specific benefits  in their workplaces and careers. Many go on to  make important contributions  to their communities and to shape society as a whole.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Temple Grandin,  an outspoken author and speaker on autism  and a professor of animal science at Colorado State University, has credited her autism with influencing her research on animal handling and animal behaviors. Comedian Dan Aykroyd, who was  an original cast member and host of “Saturday Night Live” , credits his diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome and fixation on ghosts for  developing the movie “Ghostbusters” .\n \n\n   \n   Read more:  How federal officials talk about health is shifting in ways that make me worried for my autistic child \n \n\n   \n  A more complete picture of autism that includes strengths as well as challenges creates a starting point for building communities that are inclusive and accepting of autistic people. From there, policymakers, employers and others can start to create dynamic and vibrant places where people with autism can successfully live, work and play alongside their nonautistic peers.\n \n\n   \n  And, given that  children with autism will become adults with autism , it allows experts like me to identify needs and design policies that help communities support autistic people at different stages of their life.\n \n\n   \n  For example, the growing number of students with developmental challenges  raises demands on special education services . This means state and local education systems may need to develop and implement specialized training programs for educators to better support autistic students in the classroom.\n \n\n   \n  Autistic children who need accommodations in school may also need support to succeed in adulthood. This can range from having physicians who  gear their clinical practices  to better listen to autistic patients to  work-from-home and other accommodations  that encourage engagement with traditional employment.\n \n\n   \n  Broader frameworks such as laws and policies can also help attune workplaces and other environments to the needs of people with autism. For example,  independent living programs  and programs that  train, hire and retain workers with disabilities  can ensure the economic success of people with autism.\n \n\n   \n  Cities can also become  autism certified , a process that brings together community stakeholders in health care, education, local government, hospitality and leisure to better serve those with autism. This includes training on how to interact with people who have cognitive differences as well as creating sensory-friendly environments. The city that I live in – Mesa, Arizona –  was the first to gain  such certification in 2019, and a  handful of other cities  have followed suit.\n \n\n   \n  As I see it, rather than a cause for fear, the growing recognition of autism is an invitation to build a world where every way of thinking and being has a chance to thrive.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/economy/scotus-trump-tariffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:44:00-05:00","title":"Trade deals and $90 billion in tariff revenue: What’s riding on the landmark Supreme Court case kicking off this week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on whether President Donald Trump had legal authority to impose high tariffs on key trading partners—such as India, Brazil, and China—using powers granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

riding on the landmark Supreme Court case kicking off this week \n       \n  By Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:44 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In just a few days, the Supreme Court will start hearing arguments in what President Donald Trump is calling “one of the most important cases in the history of our country.”\n \n\n   \n  With the bulk of his tariffs — arguably the cornerstone of his entire economic agenda — in jeopardy, he has floated an unprecedented appearance at the nation’s highest court.\n \n\n   \n  The case will consider whether Trump had the legal authority to impose tariffs by citing a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n \n\n   \n  Trump used those powers to push import tax rates as high as 50% on key trading partners including India and Brazil and  as high as 145%  on China earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  A ruling against the president does not mean the sudden cancellation of all tariffs in place, but the outcome could radically reshape Trump’s economic strategy.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s riding on the Supreme Court’s decision:\n \n\n   \n    Almost $90 billion in tariff revenue\n \n\n   \n  As of September 23, American businesses have paid nearly $90 billion to cover the IEEPA tariffs being challenged, according to US Customs and Border Patrol data. That’s more than half of the tariff revenue the country collected during the 2025 fiscal year, which ended on September 30.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Trump said in an interview with Fox Business that if the Supreme Court ruled against him, “we’d have to pay back money” and reimburse companies for the billions of dollars they have already paid.\n \n\n   \n  While the case plays out — and it could go on for several months — businesses will need to keep paying IEEPA tariffs, so the sum of potential refunds will keep growing.\n \n\n   \n  However, it would not be an easy or quick process for businesses to get refunds. It’s also unclear if all businesses that have paid these tariffs would qualify for a refund. The justices would likely make such determinations if they ultimately render Trump’s IEEPA tariffs illegal, trade attorneys  told CNN .\n \n\n   \n    Trade agreements\n \n\n   \n  The threat of instantly imposing higher tariffs is a  key tool  Trump has used to pressure countries into entering trade agreements and, in some cases, signing deals with the United States. In exchange, trading partners have committed to increasing purchases of American goods and increasing their investments in American businesses on top of lowering tariffs on American exports.\n \n\n   \n  But all that could be jeopardized if the Supreme Court sides against Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “The IEEPA tariffs have been the basis for countries to reach agreements with the United States, and it is unknown what happens if the IEEPA tariffs no longer can be imposed,” Dave Townsend, a partner in Dorsey & Whitney’s International Trade Group, said in a note last week.\n \n\n   \n  “Presumably, the Trump Administration will claim that nothing changes, and that the agreements remain valid,” he added. But it could certainly incentivize trading partners to try to go back to the drawing table with Trump, aiming to get better arrangements. It could even empower some countries to impose their own retaliatory tariffs on American exports until their own border taxes are lowered.\n \n\n   \n    What this means for Trump’s tariff agenda\n \n\n   \n  US presidents have always had an  extensive menu  of tariffs to impose. But Trump has mainly used two in his second term: the IEEPA tariffs and Section 232 tariffs, which give the president the authority to impose higher tariffs on national security grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Section 232 tariffs can only be used to target specific industry sectors, and require an investigation by the Commerce Department. Trump has used Section 232 this year to raise border taxes on autos, auto parts, steel, aluminum, copper and furniture, among others. He’s also initiated several ongoing investigations that could result in higher levies on a slew of other goods.\n \n\n   \n  Trump will retain the ability to impose those tariffs as well as several others no matter how the Supreme Court rules. But none of those will allow him to change import duties with the flick of a switch, as he has done with IEEPA.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/americas/mexico-mayor-killed-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:29:00-05:00","title":"Mexico’s Sheinbaum Pledges Justice After Murder of Outspoken Anti-Crime Mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the murder of Carlos Manzo, the outspoken anti-crime mayor of Uruapan in Michoacán, Mexico, who was shot during a Day of the Dead festival in November 2025.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum promised on Sunday there would be justice for the brazen murder of a local mayor, Carlos Manzo, an outspoken critic of organized crime who had called on the government to do more to protect him and others.\n \n\n   \n  Manzo, 40, was shot on Saturday while attending a candlelight Day of the Dead festival in the city center of Uruapan, in the violence-plagued western state of Michoacan.\n \n\n   \n  Two suspects were arrested and a third was dead, Mexico’s security ministry said on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum called an emergency meeting of her security cabinet on Sunday morning, later condemning Manzo’s “vile” assassination in a statement on X.\n \n\n   \n  “We reaffirm our commitment to deploy all the State’s efforts to achieve peace and security with zero impunity and full justice,” Sheinbaum wrote.\n \n\n   \n  A march was called for Sunday in Michoacan’s capital, Morelia, to demand justice for Manzo’s death and an end to violence and corruption.\n \n\n   \n  One of the few independent politicians elected to office in Mexico, Manzo had been Uruapan’s mayor since September 2024. Since taking office, Manzo, often seen wearing a bulletproof vest, had called on the federal government to do more to fight organized crime while expressing fears for his own safety.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to be just another mayor on the list of those executed, those whose lives have been taken from them,” Manzo said in an interview in September with Mexican journalist Joaquin Lopez-Doriga.\n \n\n   \n  Uruapan has been called Mexico’s avocado capital because it sits in the heart of Michoacan’s avocado-growing region.

The protection included 14 National Guard troops tasked with perimeter security, while local police provided immediate security.\n \n\n   \n  “The aggressors took advantage of the vulnerability of a public event,” Harfuch said, referring to Manzo’s murder. “Be certain that there will be no impunity.”\n \n\n   \n  U.S. officials condemned the killing.\n \n\n   \n  “The U.S. stands ready to deepen security cooperation with Mexico to wipe out organized crime on both sides of the border,” Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau wrote on X, sharing a photo of Manzo with his young son shortly before the mayor’s murder.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/sport/nfl-wrap-week-9","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:05:00-05:00","title":"A wild finish in Cincy, a star player’s gruesome injury and multiple games come down to the final seconds in NFL’s Week 9","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Week 9 of the 2025 NFL season, multiple dramatic finishes highlighted the excitement and unpredictability of the league.

And in the day’s most anticipated matchup, the Buffalo Bills survived a last-gasp effort from the Kansas City Chiefs.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you may have missed on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n     Bears make an incredible last-minute comeback \n \n\n   \n  The script flipped a few times in Cincinnati on Sunday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The Chicago Bears led by two touchdowns with five minutes left in the game, another seeming disappointment for the Bengals on home turf. Bengals quarterback Joe Flacco found Noah Fant for a 23-yard touchdown pass with 1:43 to go, and then Cincy converted on the two-point conversion attempt to pull within six points.\n \n\n   \n  The Bengals then lined up for a desperation onside kick and, thanks to the slightest of touches off a Bears player’s foot, managed to recover the ball to get possession back.\n \n\n   \n  Flacco again drove his team down the field and, with 54 seconds to play, hit Andrei Iosivas for a 9-yard touchdown pass. The Bengals converted the extra point and suddenly had the lead with less than a minute to go. An incredible comeback had Paycor Stadium rocking in disbelief.\n \n\n   \n  A few moments later, it would be silenced as that disbelief turned to shock.\n \n\n   \n  Bears quarterback Caleb Williams hit tight end Colston Loveland with a pass and the tight end barely evaded two Bengals defenders, who hit each other instead of Loveland. To the dismay of the home fans, Loveland scampered 58 yards for a touchdown, stealing the lead – and the game – back for the Bears with just 17 seconds to play. The Bears won 47-42.\n \n\n   \n     Josh Allen and the Bills outduel the Chiefs \n \n\n   \n  In a matchup of two of the game’s brightest stars, Bills quarterback Josh Allen bested Patrick Mahomes and the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs in the weekend’s highest-profile game, winning 28-21.\n \n\n   \n  Allen had an extremely efficient performance, going 23-for-26 and passing for 273 yards, passing for one touchdown and running for two more. James Cook III put in a strong game for the Bills on the ground, running for 114 yards, and Dalton Kincaid led the way for the team’s receivers with six catches for 101 yards and one touchdown.\n \n\n   \n  The Bills got ahead early and stayed in front, holding off a late charge from the Chiefs. Kareem Hunt ran in a 1-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter to cut the Bills’ lead to seven, and the Chiefs had the ball last with a chance to tie. Ultimately, Mahomes’ Hail Mary pass was batted away by Buffalo defenders.\n \n\n   \n     Minnesota defeats the Lions in NFC North clash \n \n\n   \n  The Minnesota Vikings got their franchise quarterback back on the field on Sunday and J.J. McCarthy showed why the team bet on him this offseason.\n \n\n   \n  McCarthy’s stat line wasn’t that impressive – 14-for-25 passing for 143 yards, two touchdowns and an interception – but the second-year man from Michigan showed incredible moxie to navigate a tricky away game against the two-time defending division champions.\n \n\n   \n  The key play came in the final minutes after the Jared Goff hit Jameson Williams for a touchdown to bring the Lions back within three points. Needing a first down to seal the game, McCarthy found Jalen Nailor for a 16-yard gain to convert on a high-pressure third down that allowed the Vikings to take a knee and run out the rest of the clock.\n \n\n   \n  The 27-24 victory for the Vikings reinvigorates their season in the incredibly tight NFC North. All four teams – Minnesota, Detroit, Green Bay and Chicago – are all separated by less than two games.\n \n\n   \n     Washington’s star quarterback injured again in loss \n \n\n   \n  The Washington Commanders entered this season looking like one of the league’s new powers after their run to the NFC championship game last season behind quarterback Jayden Daniels.\n \n\n   \n  Those hopes have gone up in smoke this year.\n \n\n   \n  Daniels had already missed multiple games this year with a left knee sprain and right hamstring sprain, and now it appears he’s going to be on the shelf for a significant amount of time. The second-year quarterback was injured in the fourth quarter when his left arm buckled underneath him as he was being tackled by a Seattle Seahawks defender, a gruesome injury that’s being called a dislocated elbow by the team.\n \n\n   \n  The game was already well out of hand that point after the Seahawks scored four touchdowns in the first half to take a 28-0 lead.

The Atlanta Falcons fell on the road to the New England Patriots, 24-23. The Falcons looked to have tied the game up in the fourth quarter with less than five minutes to go on Drake London’s third touchdown catch of the game but Parker Romo missed the extra point.

Trump awaits an early verdict with Tuesday’s elections, next year’s midterms are already on his mind \n       \n  By Jeff Zeleny, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Even as Tuesday’s elections hang in the balance,  President Donald Trump  has bluntly suggested that he is already looking ahead to the 2026 midterm races with a sense of dread.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had success like nobody, but for some reason, you lose the midterms,” Trump said late last month at the White House, waxing aloud about the political backlash that most presidents face during midterm elections. “I don’t know why. It doesn’t make sense.”\n \n\n   \n  A year after winning back the White House, the first big electoral test of Trump’s second term  is taking shape in marquee elections  on Tuesday, when Virginia and New Jersey will elect governors, California will vote on a pivotal ballot measure to redraw its congressional maps, and New York City will pick its next mayor.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a chance for some voters to deliver a verdict on the actions of the new Trump administration. While hardly a perfect indicator,  the results could offer clues  about the political climate heading into next year’s elections, when voters will determine control of Congress for the rest of Trump’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to win the midterms,” Trump said as he addressed Senate Republicans during a lunch in the Rose Garden. “Otherwise, all of the things that we’ve done, so many of them, are going to be taken away by the radical left lunatics. I mean, we’re going to end up with a communist mayor in New York. Can you believe it?”\n \n\n   \n  As Trump has repeatedly made clear, the race for New York City mayor  has been on his mind  far more than any of the other races being decided Tuesday. He frequently disparages the positions of Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed  democratic socialist , who is well on his way to becoming the newest foil for Republicans as Democrats seek to rebuild their party.\n \n\n   \n  The president has followed the other contests to varying degrees, aides say, asking for more updates in the closing days and directing some campaign funds to help voter turnout efforts.   He fully endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican gubernatorial nominee in New Jersey, but  stopped short  of doing the same in Virginia, where Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP candidate, is seen as less competitive.\n \n\n   \n  “People like me there,” Trump said of New Jersey, a state where he owns golf courses and spends considerable time in the summers. “It’s typically not Republican, but turning Republican very quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  That assessment will be tested in the contest between Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made  significant gains in New Jersey  last fall — losing by 6 points to Kamala Harris, compared with a resounding 16-point defeat to Joe Biden in 2020 — but Democrats still hold considerable structural advantages, including a voter registration edge on Republicans of more than 800,000.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, a government shutdown entering a second month  hangs particularly heavy over the election , with hundreds of thousands of federal workers, active-duty military and government contractors living in the state. Trump also made gains in Virginia in 2024, but still fell short to Harris by 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, has held a consistent lead over Earle-Sears, which is among the reasons that Trump’s aides say he has not become more involved. He called into a tele-rally on Thursday night in hopes of boosting turnout for the Republican ticket. He is scheduled to give a final push Monday night from the Oval Office when he holds a telephone pep rally in Virginia and New Jersey to fire up GOP voters.\n \n\n   \n  In the final days of the campaign, Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida — far away from both states. Former President Barack Obama visited Virginia and New Jersey  to rally the Democratic base  and highlight the stakes of the election.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,” Obama said Saturday night in Newark. “Every day this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and carelessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain old craziness.”\n \n\n   \n    The Trump effect\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats win their races in Virginia and New Jersey, the outcome could offer a window into some of the headwinds facing Trump and Republicans going into next year’s elections. Yet if Republicans win — or deliver a split verdict — it may suggest that Democrats have misjudged how much of a liability Trump could pose to his party.\n \n\n   \n  “If you get a flat tire on the way home today, she’s going to blame President Trump,” Ciattarelli tells supporters of Sherrill at most every campaign stop, hoping to make light of Democratic finger-pointing at Trump. “There’s nothing she won’t blame on the president.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are seeking to ride an early wave of voter discontent, hoping to deal a political setback to Trump a year after his historic return to power. In his first term, Democrats won the races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey in 2017 before going on to take control of the House the following year in a sweeping victory.\n \n\n   \n  The White House is working hard to avoid a replay of that scenario.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the driving force behind  a redistricting arms race  playing out across the country. After Texas drew new congressional lines that could add up to five Republican seats in the House, California responded with the ballot initiative to redraw districts to favor Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina and Missouri have already followed the president’s call to squeeze more Republican seats by redrawing congressional districts, while efforts are underway to follow suit in other GOP-led states such as Indiana and Kansas, where political and procedural obstacles remain. Democrats in Virginia  gave approval Friday  to a proposed constitutional amendment to do the same, while some party leaders in Illinois are exploring possible changes to the state’s map.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an unprecedented mid-decade gerrymandering effort — akin to changing the rules in the middle of the game — that started with an order from the Oval Office. Trump still fumes about the investigations and impeachment proceedings that played out during the second half of his first term after Democrats won control of the House.\n \n\n   \n  “The president is obsessively focused on the midterms,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions. “He remembers what happened the first time he was in office.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Everything’s about Trump’\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s name, of course, is not actually on Tuesday’s ballot. If it was, Republican strategists say they would feel far more bullish about rebuilding a Trump coalition that could provide a stronger path to victory.\n \n\n   \n  He figures prominently into the strategies of both sides.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are counting on a disdain for the president and an objection to his policies to help energize and unify their base. Republicans are working overtime to motivate those who love Trump, paying extra attention to voters with shaky attendance records in off-year elections.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to send a message to Washington,” said Neil Wintfeld, a Virginia Democratic voter who dropped by a Spanberger rally in Alexandria during the closing days of the race. “President Trump generates a lot of negative enthusiasm and motivates people to react to the destruction he is visiting upon our institutions.”\n \n\n   \n  Sharon Cox, a Republican who voted for Trump in each of his three presidential bids, said she was tired of politicians of all stripes invoking the president’s name in elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything’s about Trump, it seems,” Cox said after casting an early ballot in Hampton, Virginia. “I know everybody’s not going to like Trump. I know everybody’s not going to like somebody on the Democratic side, but the hate has to go before our country can move forward.”\n \n\n   \n  While the lessons of these elections can be overstated, there is little question the results of Virginia and New Jersey will be analyzed — at least in part — through a Trump-colored lens, given how he is  already laser-focused  on the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  “If you have a great presidency, it only makes sense that you win the midterms,” Trump said in his Rose Garden remarks, expressing his bafflement that only twice in nearly a century has the president’s party not lost House seats in a midterm election. “There might be some dark, deep psychological reason where they want to vote the opposite way. I don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/minneapolis-mayoral-election-police","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-05:00","title":"Minneapolis set to vote for mayor, with policing at the crossroads","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the Minneapolis Police Department faced a crisis of public trust, with staff reductions, officer trauma, and widespread criticism.

\nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Brian O’Hara took over the Minneapolis Police Department in 2022, he saw a department in free fall.\n \n\n   \n  The  murder of George Floyd  and the ensuing riots in 2020 had fractured the public’s trust in law enforcement. Crime and shootings were rising at startling levels. The police force was demoralized and dropped from over 900 sworn officers to a low of 550 last year, stretched dangerously thin in a city of over 400,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  “It was, essentially, kind of a hopeless situation,” O’Hara told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “When I got here, the Minneapolis Police Department was functioning more like a Fire Department,” he said. “The officers were traumatized. They were sitting in the station, only going out on calls. There wasn’t that much proactive activity happening.”\n \n\n   \n  Three years later, staffing has begun to recover. Using an aggressive recruitment strategy, the police department surpassed 600 sworn personnel in June – a  milestone Mayor Jacob Frey praised in a city news release .\n \n\n   \n  But challenges and criticisms remain, including a recent mass shooting at a homeless encampment, state and federal consent decrees and questions about police’s interaction with federal immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Minneapolis voters will have their say.\n \n\n   \n  A mayoral election on Tuesday pits Frey, the two-term incumbent, against over a dozen challengers, led by three progressive rivals: State Sen. and Democratic Socialist Omar Fateh, attorney and businessman Jazz Hampton and minister DeWayne Davis. That trio has criticized the city’s public safety efforts and joined forces for a “ slate for change ” in an election that uses  ranked choice voting .\n \n\n   \n  Early polling shows Frey as the favorite, with Fateh his closest competitor.\n \n\n   \n  The election bears some similarities to New York City’s, with both Fateh and Zohran Mamdani as 30-something, Muslim, Democratic Socialists who have proposed rent stabilization policies.\n \n\n   \n  In Minneapolis, police staffing and public safety have been key concerns among voters – for example, they were the first two questions in a mayoral debate hosted by  MPR News/Star Tribune  last week.\n \n\n   \n  The terms of the debate have generally pitted Frey, who has criticized calls to “defund the police,” against a left-wing critic in Fateh, who  has said  Frey “failed to implement meaningful reforms to police” and has pushed to shift some responsibilities from police to other departments.\n \n\n   \n  Whoever wins the race will have the power to set the city’s police culture, said Michelle Gross, the president of the activist group  Communities United Against Police Brutality . Yet no matter who is in charge, she said, the future success of the police will come from building trust with the community.\n \n\n   \n  “Things are different now, but they’re not all the way different, but we’re getting there,” she told CNN. “And the bottom line is to keep people at the table so we do get there.”\n \n\n   \n    The battle to regain public trust\n \n\n   \n  Jason Fletcher, the founder of Fletcher’s Ice Cream & Cafe, got an up-close view of the Minneapolis police when his shop was targeted by a  Molotov cocktail  twice within a 24-hour period last week.\n \n\n   \n  The explosive attacks caused damage to his shop, though no one was injured. He said he believes the LGBTQ Pride flag outside his business may be the reason it was targeted.\n \n\n   \n  Fletcher said he didn’t have the “highest expectations” for police, noting its well-known staff shortages and other issues.\n \n\n   \n  “I definitely have seen a lot of the officers that are here, they’re discouraged,” he told CNN. “I feel like they’ve lost the passion for their job, a lot of them, and a lot of them are scared.”\n \n\n   \n  But the job they did investigating the attacks was “really amazing,” he said. Police responded to the scene before he did both times and worked quickly and efficiently to arrest a suspect.\n \n\n   \n  “They were reassuring. Minneapolis arson – the officer, he looked me in the face and said, ‘I’m not gonna go home until this man is behind bars.’ And he didn’t lie,” Fletcher said. “In less than four hours, they apprehended him and made sure they got him off the street.\n \n\n   \n  “In my opinion, Minneapolis police and ATF, they killed it. They did a great job.”\n \n\n   \n  As police chief, O’Hara said his primary goal has been to push a sense of urgency and pride in the department, while still acknowledging its unique challenges.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re the most scrutinized police department on earth. It’s a tough job,” he said. “But if you do come on this job, and you’re coming on for the right reasons, you have an opportunity, once your career is over, to look back on what you’ve done and realize every day of your life you have an opportunity to make a real difference in people’s lives.\n \n\n   \n  “There are people in this community who have real needs, who desperately need the police and they need good police,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  That pitch has helped the department start to rebuild its staff, now up to 620 sworn members and looking to continue growing into next year, O’Hara said. Still, the department relies on an “exorbitant” amount of overtime just to do basic police work and cover all its shifts.\n \n\n   \n  “The amount of overtime that we depend on for those things is not sustainable,” he said. “But the good news for our officers that are here is those numbers are rising, but it is a gradual process. It’s going to take time.”\n \n\n   \n    The politics of public safety\n \n\n   \n  No matter who wins the mayoral election, Minneapolis is still legally required to enact police reforms.\n \n\n   \n  After a jury convicted former police officer  Derek Chauvin  of the murder of George Floyd in 2021, the Department of Justice launched an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department. The  DOJ issued a report  in 2023 finding the city and police engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives people of their rights. This January, the city and DOJ agreed to a  federal consent decree  that requires police reforms and court supervision.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights  reached a court-enforceable agreement  with Minneapolis requiring changes to address race-based policing.\n \n\n   \n  In May, the DOJ under President Donald Trump  moved to end  the federal consent decree. However, Frey signed an  executive order  confirming the city’s commitment to implementing the reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Gross, the community activist, said her group has been working with police on its reforms.\n \n\n   \n  “The Minneapolis Police are rewriting their policies, and as part of the condition of doing that work, they actually have to take input from the community, and we have been working very hard to give them very robust input,” she said. “It’s not word-smithing, it’s looking at best practices and looking at what has worked in other departments.”\n \n\n   \n  The hope is these consent decrees and agreements provide a path forward for the city and police.\n \n\n   \n  “These are good things,” she said. “It gives us a framework to make the kinds of improvements we need to make. Unfortunately, we’re still a long way from getting there, but we’ve got a way to get there.”\n \n\n   \n    What the candidates have said about policing\n \n\n   \n  The mayoral candidates have taken different approaches to the politics of policing in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Four years ago, Minneapolis residents  rejected a ballot measure  that would have overhauled the city’s police structure, replacing the police department with a Department of Public Safety. The measure, wrapped up in “ defund the police ” debates, had been drafted amid the national fury over Floyd’s murder but was put to voters as concerns about rising crime drained energy from the protest movement.\n \n\n   \n  Fateh supported the ballot measure. Frey did not.\n \n\n   \n  That contrast has been on display this mayoral election, as Frey has accused Fateh of supporting defund the police measures.\n \n\n   \n  “Here’s the truth: We also need more police officers to be able to handle these situations. When you have less officers per capita than virtually any city in the country, you need to do the necessary work to increase that,” Frey said.\n \n\n   \n  Fateh has countered that he is merely proposing moving some responsibilities from the police to other departments. He has repeatedly cited a study from  NYU Law’s Policing Project  that found 47% of police calls are “potential” candidates for an alternate response.\n \n\n   \n  “If we’re able to take away nearly half of their caseload, then we can have law enforcement focus on violent crime, on drug trafficking, on human trafficking, clearly the case backlog, not taking away investigators from the caseload or their investigatory work,” Fateh said.\n \n\n   \n  For O’Hara, a transplant from Newark, New Jersey, his first mayoral election in Minneapolis has been a lot to take in.\n \n\n   \n  “I have been surprised by how overly politicized policing is here,” he said. “I’m just not used to it. I’m used to more people being able to agree we need police and we need good police, and we need to address this stuff urgently. Some of it is a little foreign to me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/style/abandoned-homes-america-bryan-sansivero-photography","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:08:00-04:00","title":"A portal into another life: Photographing America’s abandoned homes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A New York-based photographer, Bryan Sansivero, has spent a decade photographing abandoned homes across the United States, capturing their decaying structures and haunting interiors as time capsules that reveal forgotten lives.

November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The houses are worn by weather and time, photographed in isolation like forgotten monuments. They have a haunted feel: Windows are boarded on Victorian-era turrets; paint flakes off the towering composite columns of a once-grand portico; wraparound verandas, perhaps once host to evening nightcaps and slow Sunday mornings, are barren. Walls crumble, roofs collapse, and greenery reclaims them.\n \n\n   \n  For a decade, the New York-based photographer  Bryan Sansivero  has sought out forgotten, dilapidated homes across the United States — each with its own story to tell. Inside deserted clapboard farmsteads, palatial Antebellum-era plantation houses and maximalist Queen Anne-style structures, Sansivero has discovered many residences that were never emptied, offering a portal into another life.\n \n\n   \n  Musty libraries are filled with books, papers and photographs; in one, a nearby coffee mug sits unretrieved. Grand pianos and half-full liquor bottles collect dust, while colorful children’s playrooms scattered with toys are unsettlingly idle. The images come together in his latest book, “America the Abandoned: Captivating Portraits of Deserted Homes.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s about capturing these time capsules; these lost places,” he explained in a phone call. “I like the mystery of not knowing what you’re going to find.”\n \n\n   \n  Sansivero has documented abandoned spaces since he was a film studies major in college, starting out with the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, a disused psychiatric hospital in Long Island that served as the setting for his documentary thesis.\n \n\n   \n  Over time, he found himself drawn to private residences — millions of which are abandoned across the country — especially as urban exploration, or “urbex,” became a highly monetized form of social media content that has become what he likens to a competitive sport. Abandoned hospitals, churches and schools are easy to find; houses, on the other hand, have a sense of discovery.\n \n\n   \n  “If you go viral, you can get two million likes and hundreds of thousands of followers, and people are trying to chase that,” he said, saying it becomes about “the most views, the biggest and the best and all of that.”   Instead, Sansivero has reacted in opposition, opting for the slow and deliberate methodology of medium-format film — though he does still post his images to more than  100,000 followers on Instagram . “For me, I’ve just been going backwards. I want to shoot more film. I want to shoot less digital, with an emphasis on using older, unique equipment.”\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean the homes Sansivero finds have been untouched since they were inhabited. Many have been destroyed or vandalized, perhaps by squatters, teenagers or the urbex set. Occasionally, he’s gotten a tip on a house only to find it filled by other photographers and content creators racing to be there first.\n \n\n   \n  But often, he finds houses by chance, or with help from Google Earth, taking weeklong trips to the South or Midwest to areas impacted by the loss of industry or other economic or environmental pressures.\n \n\n   \n  His treks come with risks — he’s inhaled mold (and now carries masks), his leg has gone through a decaying floor, and he’s felt the uneasy sway of a home seemingly near collapse. Yet he’s been undeterred, drawn to dramatic architecture and eccentric or historical collections, such as a room stacked high with vintage dollhouses, mannequins populating a house like ghosts, or interiors still decorated for a Christmas of the distant past.\n \n\n   \n  “I can find a dozen or more houses exploring in a day and not want to photograph anything, because it’s an empty shell or it’s been trashed — it’s not telling a story about the previous owner,” he said. “I’m interested in what happened, why it was left like this.”\n \n\n   \n  Sansivero researches the houses he photographs to whatever extent he can, but in “Abandoned America,” he shares limited details, giving a sense of who lived there but anonymizing them, avoiding social media’s instinct to exploit or exhaust a tragic story. Among the homes he has discovered are former respective residences of a local politician, an important fashion and textile designer, and a Pulitzer-Prize winning author. In one house, filled with life-sized mannequin mermaids, he found a disturbing published account that told the tale of a serial killer with victims in the basement, he recounted. The mermaids’ origins remain unknown.\n \n\n   \n  The photographer found that former residence by chance when he was with a friend on the road; the boarded-up brick property by the highway was unmissable. “We were just driving down the highway, and I was like, ‘Oh, look at that house.’”\n \n\n   \n  Lately, Sansivero has set his sights overseas, exploring chateaus and castles in Europe whose histories can stretch back much further in time. “America the Abandoned” may be a cap on a decade-long exploration of US homes, but it’s likely more a pause than an end to the work. After all, as Sansivero noted, with time, there will always be more to discover.\n \n\n   \n   Images: Excerpted from “America the Abandoned: Captivating Portraits of Deserted Homes” © 2025 Bryan Sansivero.

They have advanced the case to the nation’s highest court even as their larger and better-known competitors have remained notably silent.\n \n\n   \n  The lack of public input from major US companies on the docket of a Supreme Court appeal with potentially vast consequences for their bottom line and   the economy as a whole is unusual and likely based at least in part on a fear of retribution from the White House, multiple people involved with the case and outside experts said.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court hears   arguments Wednesday in the case, which will determine the fate of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs as well as duties he has unilaterally imposed on imports from China, Mexico and Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made the tariffs, a response to trade imbalances and fentanyl trafficking, the centerpiece of his economic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked that those with much more power and money did not step up,” said  Victor Owen Schwartz , the founder of V.O.S. Selections, the wine and spirits company that is one of the lead plaintiffs in the litigation. “So when I was afforded the opportunity to speak for small American business, I took it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has relied on a 1970s-era emergency law to reshape global trade and   alliances with allies and adversaries. The law lets a president “regulate importation” during emergencies, but does not specifically mention tariffs. Relying on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trump has rapidly turned some of those tariffs on and off and adjusted rates suddenly to squeeze or ease the pressure during negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  The small businesses suing the administration say the moves are driving costs – and uncertainty – to intolerable levels.\n \n\n   \n  While the president has described the case as an existential one for the country, he has avoided criticizing the companies involved in the litigation directly. Small businesses generally enjoy bipartisan political support and so having lesser-known companies lead the legal charge on tariffs may prove to be a strategic advantage.\n \n\n   \n  Several plaintiffs interviewed by CNN were careful to frame the case as far away from national politics as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an asphyxiating tax,” said Rick Woldenberg, the CEO of Learning Resources, which makes educational toys and other products and which is also a lead plaintiff.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not targeting Mr. Trump because I’m not a politician,” he said. “I’m a taxpayer who’s been hit with an unlawful tax.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has argued the law’s words clearly encompass tariffs, even if the word “tariff” is not explicitly included. And it has warned that a loss would have “catastrophic consequences” for the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “Plaintiffs would unwind trade arrangements worth trillions of dollars, as President Trump has leveraged the IEEPA tariffs into negotiated framework deals with major trading partners – including the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and now China – that address underlying causes of the declared emergencies,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration’s top appellate lawyer, told the Supreme Court in written arguments last week.\n \n\n   \n    Taking a side\n \n\n   \n  Even when they are not named plaintiffs, major companies often wade into Supreme Court cases with friend-of-court briefs, offering their own take on the controversy pending before the justices.\n \n\n   \n  Three years ago, more than 60 major American firms – including General Electric, Procter & Gamble and Intel –  signed a brief urging the justices  not to end affirmative action in college admissions, for instance.\n \n\n   \n  Months later, the court  ignored their advice . Today, some of the same companies that signed that brief are facing  criticism in the second Trump administration  for efforts to expand diversity within their workforces.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, Apple CEO Tim Cook  personally signed an amicus brief  at the high court supporting the continuation of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA , program created during the Obama administration for Dreamers. Home Depot  signed a brief in 2021  in a case on damages suits. Walmart  jumped into an appeal  in 2017 dealing with the credit card industry.\n \n\n   \n  But the big difference today is the administration’s willingness to  pursue retribution  against critics. Large companies, including many that have been affected by the tariffs, also avoided weighing in on the cases as they moved through lower federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  “The federal government has immense leverage and immense power and can upend your business with a tweet or a tax investigation,” said Gregory Shaffer, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “I think there’s a sense that companies wanted to be more careful with this administration.”\n \n\n   \n  Friend-of-the-court briefs rarely have sway over the outcome of a case at the Supreme Court, but they can sometimes influence justices in unexpected ways. Last week, an amicus brief from a Georgetown law professor led the court to  pause a case involving Trump’s use of the National Guard  in Illinois and request additional information from both the administration and state officials.\n \n\n   \n    Fearing the ‘pain cave’\n \n\n   \n  Cassie Abel, founder and CEO of a women’s outdoor apparel company called Wild Rye, agreed that fear of retaliation was probably part of the reason that larger companies haven’t engaged in the tariffs appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Abel, who launched her company in Idaho nearly a decade ago, noted that Walmart and other retailers  endured public blowback from Trump  this year when they threatened tariff-related price increases.\n \n\n   \n  “That was a clear signal that anyone who wants to speak out against this is going to be in the pain cave,” said Abel, who joined an amicus brief with other small businesses opposed to the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  But larger companies, Abel said, also may not be as immediately affected by tariffs as small ones. Some can switch supply chains or absorb the costs. And, Abel said, some of her largest competitors have pushed back on tariffs – just in quieter ways that don’t involve taking a public position in a high-profile case.\n \n\n   \n  Some, meanwhile, have  managed to secure exemptions  to mitigate the impact of the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Several major companies that have submitted briefs in high-profile cases at the Supreme Court in the past – including Apple, Levi Strauss, Walmart and Home Depot – did not respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The briefs that have made their way to the Supreme Court overwhelmingly oppose Trump’s emergency tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Former national security officials, a group representing the watchmaking industry, nearly three dozen former federal judges, a Virginia-based seller of audio equipment and many other small businesses told the justices they’re opposed to the import taxes. The Chamber of Commerce also filed a brief in favor of unwinding Trump’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also not clear who is funding the litigation. Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at Liberty Justice Center, a group involved in the case, told CNN that it is funded by “individuals and groups that support our mission” but said it doesn’t disclose its donors without their permission.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of calculations going on,” said Gregory Husisian, a trade lawyer who represents large importers for the Foley & Lardner law firm. Large companies, he said, have to think about what legal argument they can raise “that’s not already before the court.”\n \n\n   \n  Without that, he said, “what do you really gain by being the person who sticks your neck out?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/cnn-poll-democrats-trump-midterms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Democrats Are More Enthusiastic About the Midterms as Trump’s Approval Hits a Second-Term Low, CNN Poll Finds","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"One year before the 2026 midterms, a CNN poll by SSRS reveals that the Democratic Party holds a strong enthusiasm advantage over Republicans, with 47% of registered voters favoring a Democrat and 42% a Republican.

approval hits a second-term low, CNN poll finds \n       \n  By Jennifer Agiesta, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One year out from the midterm elections, the Democratic Party holds a sizable enthusiasm advantage as views of President Donald Trump dip further into negative territory, according to a new  CNN poll conducted by SSRS .\n \n\n   \n  The fall of 2025 is not a replay of 2017, the year before the Democrats captured control of the US House in Trump’s first term. The Democrats’ 5-point advantage among registered voters in the generic congressional ballot falls short of  the 11-point edge they held in CNN polling  a year before the 2018 midterms. And favorable views of the party still stand  near all-time lows  as they have throughout this year, 8 points below where they were in the fall of Trump’s first year in office.\n \n\n   \n  In a midterm election year, though, views of the president can outweigh perceptions of the opposition party. Trump’s approval rating in the poll stands at 37%, the worst of his second term in CNN polling and roughly equivalent to his 36% approval rating at this point in his first term.\n \n\n   \n  And his disapproval rating, at 63%, is numerically the highest of either term, one point above the previous high of 62% as he was leaving office in January 2021.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Poll of Polls  average, which puts Trump’s approval rating a few points higher at 41% as of Sunday, charts a similar trend since January. Approval of the president has dipped across partisan and demographic lines since the summer in CNN’s polling.\n \n\n   \n    Democrats have a very early advantage\n \n\n   \n  Looking ahead  to next year’s midterms, Democrats appear to have a very early advantage: 47% of registered voters say they’d vote for the Democrat in their district if the election were held today, while 42% prefer the Republican. More say they’ve ruled out supporting a Republican (42%) than say the same about a Democrat (35%). And 41% say they would be sending a message that they oppose Trump with their vote, nearly double the 21% who say their vote would be a message of support for the president. Independents break in Democrats’ favor on the generic ballot (44% to 31% for Republicans, with 19% saying they wouldn’t pick either right now).\n \n\n   \n  Registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents are far more likely than Republican-aligned voters to say they are extremely motivated to vote next year (67% compared with 46%). Those Democratic-aligned voters who consider the state of democracy to be a top concern are perhaps the most fired up within the party: 82% in that group say they are deeply motivated to vote, compared with 57 % among Democratic-aligned voters who call the economy their top concern.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s poll results suggest that the Democratic Party’s ongoing internal image troubles may not necessarily translate into defections at the ballot box. Democratic-aligned voters remain far less fond of their own party (65% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party) than Republican-aligned voters (80% have a favorable view of the GOP), but even those Democratic-aligned voters with a negative view of the party are almost universally behind the Democratic candidate in their district (93%) and broadly motivated to vote (71% say they are extremely motivated).\n \n\n   \n  All told, Democrats hold a 12-point advantage among those voters who say they are extremely or very motivated to turn out next year.\n \n\n   \n    Broad dissatisfaction with Trump and the country\n \n\n   \n  Americans are broadly dissatisfied with the state of the country (68% say things are going badly) and the economy (72% say it’s in poor shape, and 47% call the economy and cost of living the top issue facing the US). About 6 in 10 (61%) say Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 8 in 10 consider the federal government shutdown a crisis (31%) or a major problem (50%), and 61% disapprove of Trump’s handling of it. Nearly as many disapprove of the way each party’s congressional leadership is handling it (58% disapprove of each). Taken all together, about 9 in 10 American disapprove of at least one of those three players on the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  A majority hold negative views of Trump’s performance on several other key issues: most (56%) feel that his foreign policy decisions have hurt America’s standing in the world and 57% say he’s gone too far deporting immigrants living in the US illegally.\n \n\n   \n  About a quarter of Americans (26%) say the state of US democracy is the top issue facing the nation, and it is the top issue among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (45% say it’s the most important issue, with the economy and cost of living at 38%).\n \n\n   \n  Americans are increasingly likely to say Trump has gone too far in using the power of the presidency – 61% say so, up 9 points since February. On his teardown of the East Wing of the White House, 54% of the public is dissatisfied or angry, with just 10% saying they’re satisfied with or happy about that decision. Another 36% (including nearly half of Republicans) say it doesn’t matter much to them.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans also see the Republicans who control Congress as doing too much to support Trump (55%, up from 48% who felt that way in February). But the GOP base is pleased: Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are largely satisfied with the level of support the GOP in Congress provides to Trump (63% say it’s the right amount, about the same as in February).\n \n\n   \n  On the Democratic side, though, views are more divided and party support less clear. Four in 10 say the Democrats in Congress aren’t doing enough to oppose Trump, and among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 69% feel that way.\n \n\n   \n  The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS online and by phone from October 27 to 30 among a random national sample of 1,245 adults, including 954 registered voters. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points; it is plus or minus 3.6 points for results among registered voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/federal-workers-shutdown-furloughed-job-fairs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Job fairs, hobbies and community conversations: How federal workers are coping with shutdown angst","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the government shutdown persists into early November 2025, over a million federal workers remain furloughed and without pay, leading to significant financial and emotional stress.

Brian Todd, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Almost every day, Angela O’Neal sits down in her at-home creator’s studio, either painting, sketching or contemplating her next original piece to add to an abundant collection.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, her daily ritual has taken on a new meaning as she faces the same challenges as many furloughed federal employees — struggling to pay mounting health care bills, a mortgage and the costs of living without a steady paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown persists past a month, over a million furloughed federal workers will continue to go without pay, including this Prince George’s County, Maryland, resident.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been somewhat devastating for a lot of us,” O’Neal told CNN during an interview in her home. “I don’t think I realized the extent of it until after I saw that I’m not able to go to (physical therapy) appointments because of that… and so it’s been tremendously stressful for a lot of us, and in particular for caregivers and people with chronic health conditions.”\n \n\n   \n  O’Neal works for the US Navy as a program manager and is celebrating 40 years of government employment. She received a letter from her employer stating she had been furloughed on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  She has diabetic neuropathy, which affects mobility and causes numbness, tingling and burning sensations in her feet. One of her main concerns is not being able to afford her medical appointments, some of which she already canceled due to copay costs up to $90. “If I don’t have income, then I can’t make those appointments,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  During these uncertain times, O’Neal leans on her artistic hobby — not only as a coping mechanism, but also as a second form of income. She sells her paintings, prints and posters on her personal website, at rotating exhibits and even at a local cafe.\n \n\n   \n  “Reality changes when there is a picture of it,” O’Neal said. “As a contemporary artist, I am fascinated by how art can alter the way we see and feel. … So, during this government shutdown and furloughing, I find great solace in painting.”\n \n\n   \n    Hedging their bets: Furloughed workers head to job fairs\n \n\n   \n  O’Neal manages the unpredictability through artistry, but others may take a more direct, career-driven approach by canvassing job fairs — some out of precaution, others near desperation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN attended two job fairs in the Washington, DC, area recently. Many furloughed government employees at these events did not want to give their names or speak on camera for fear of losing their jobs. But they gave sobering accounts of the hardships they’re facing.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m supporting my kids. I have to tell them we have to budget,” one employee, who was furloughed from the Internal Revenue Service, said at a fair in McLean, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Another employee who didn’t want to name his agency said he’s supporting a young family. “I came all the way from Maryland … an hour-and-a-half, looking for a job,” he said. After struggling to describe the hardship of going weeks without getting paid, he finally told CNN, “I don’t know how much I have left in the tank right now, just to talk to you.”\n \n\n   \n  But a furloughed employee at a job fair in Maryland spoke openly about her struggles to cope with the shutdown.   \n \n\n   \n  Elizabeth Baker of Montgomery County received a stop-work order from her employer at the start of the shutdown. She is a policy analyst contracted to the National Institutes of Health through her employer.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t be here at a job fair if I weren’t trying to hedge my bets, as much as my employer has been very good to me,” Baker told CNN, adding that “we’re down to survival.”\n \n\n   \n  Baker told CNN that to financially cope with the shutdown, she is cashing in her holiday pay, using unemployment insurance and consulting on what to do if she can’t pay her rent.\n \n\n   \n  The event hosted by the workforce development group WorkSource Montgomery served federal workers and contractors throughout the area at a time federal workers are particularly in need of support, said the group’s executive director, Anthony Featherstone.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s tough being out of work as a federal worker. You’ve gone to school. You have lots of education and experience and are highly compensated, and now you’re in limbo,” Featherstone said.\n \n\n   \n    A focus on mental health\n \n\n   \n  K Scarry, the owner of the Kbird bar in northwest DC and a former minister, has hosted weekly “opt-in community conversations” for furloughed workers, offering them a chance to share their hardships and to network for other jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Scarry set up an additional session last week, inviting CNN along with furloughed workers. But no workers showed. Scarry said she received texts from some of them saying they didn’t want to speak to the media out of fear of retaliation. She told CNN what the conversations have been like in those weekly sessions.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s questions about, you know, ‘How do we talk to our kids? Our kids know the government is shut down. They know we work for the government. How do we have that conversation with our kids without overpromising, but also making sure they feel steady?’” she said. Scarry is offering free meals to any furloughed worker who comes to her bar.\n \n\n   \n  Baker stressed the importance of furloughed workers maintaining their mental health during this period of uncertainty. Her advice to others in her same predicament: “Look, the situation is real. It’s rough. Adapt how you can. … Keep the hope. Keep striving. You’re smart. You’ll get through this.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/sport/nascar-cup-series-championship-larson-hamlin","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:28:00Z","title":"Kyle Larson outlasts Denny Hamlin to win second career NASCAR Cup Series championship","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kyle Larson secured his second NASCAR Cup Series championship in 2025 by finishing third in the season finale at Phoenix Raceway, narrowly defeating Denny Hamlin despite not leading a single lap.

came down to the wire with  Kyle Larson  beating out Denny Hamlin to secure his second career Cup Series championship at Phoenix Raceway in Avondale, Arizona on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Larson was one of the four drivers including Hamlin, Chase Briscoe and William Byron in contention for the title, but Larson managed to finish in third position, ahead of the other three contenders to claim the championship.\n \n\n   \n  The race came with some drama as a late caution sent the finale into overtime.\n \n\n   \n  The 44-year-old Hamlin, who was looking to finally achieve glory after making his NASCAR debut in 2004, found himself three laps away from the win when Byron got a flat tire and hit the wall alongside the track to bring out the caution.\n \n\n   \n  The Joe Gibbs Racing driver, Hamlin, then went to pit for four new tires while Hendrick Motorsports’ Larson only got two which placed him in fifth position ahead of Hamlin, who was in 10th.\n \n\n   \n  With not enough time in the race, Hamlin finished in sixth as Ryan Blaney, who was eliminated from title contention last week, took the checkered flag.\n \n\n   \n  It is the second championship for the 33-year-old in 11 seasons. Larson won his  first title in 2021  when he joined Hendrick Motorsports.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, I can’t believe it. We didn’t lead a lap today and somehow won the championship,” Larson told the NBC broadcast after the race. “Really, I’m just speechless. I can’t believe it. We had an average car at best.”\n \n\n   \n  An emotionless Hamlin sat in his car, wiping his face with a towel as Larson celebrated with his team. After some time, Hamlin emerged from his car and was greeted by his Joe Gibbs Racing teammates, relishing the fact his sixth attempt at a title wasted away despite leading 208 of the 319 laps after starting on the pole.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing I could do different. I mean, prepared as good as I could coming into the weekend and my team gave me a fantastic car,” Hamlin said. “Just didn’t work out. I was just praying ‘no caution’ and we had one there. What can you do? It’s just not meant to be.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamlin said his crew chief made the right call with the tires and reiterated that the team did a “fantastic job” while sounding defeated on his future chances.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll try. I got a couple more shots at it but man, if you can’t win that one, I don’t know which one you can win,” Hamlin added.\n \n\n   \n  Larson, the only Asian American to race full-time in NASCAR, has not won a race since May, totaling 24 consecutive races but thanked his crew chief Cliff Daniels for keeping the team together.\n \n\n   \n  “Unbelievable! What a year by Hendrick Motorsports team. Cliff Daniels, everybody,” Larson said. “His leadership – his complete leadership just showed that whole race. Keep us all motivated. Always having a plan and all that. So, thats the story of our season.”\n \n\n   \n  Briscoe finished in 18th with Byron coming in 33rd after the late issue.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/japan-takaichi-north-korea-kim-jong-un-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"03:08:00-04:00","title":"Japan’s New Prime Minister Takaichi Wants Summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has announced her intention to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un — a move not seen in over two decades.

hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un – something no Japanese leader has done in more than 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  “We have already conveyed to North Korea our desire to hold a summit meeting,” Takaichi said Monday at a rally demanding the return of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea decades ago.\n \n\n   \n  The issue is one of the unresolved pain points between the two neighbors divided by sea, whose long history of colonization and conflict has doomed previous attempts at bilateral talks.\n \n\n   \n  “I want the leaders to face each other directly and achieve concrete results,” Takaichi said. “I am determined to break through and resolve the abduction issue during my tenure.”\n \n\n   \n  Japan says  at least 17 of its citizens were snatched  by North Korean agents in the late 1970s and 1980s. Five citizens were returned in 2002. The abductions appear to have been part of North Korea’s espionage program, according to a  2014 UN report. \n \n\n   \n  Pyongyang disputes the total number taken and says some died in traffic and drowning accidents, as well as suicide, and it considers the matter over.\n \n\n   \n  But for the families of Japanese abductees who remain missing, some of whom were just teenagers when they were taken, there has been no closure or relief. They, along with Japan’s revolving door of leaders over the years, have continued pressing the issue with little success.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi has met with the abductees’ families twice since taking office, including once with US President Donald Trump during his visit to Japan. She has previously said she’s committed to completing the mission of her mentor, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who introduced the abductees’ families to Trump during the US president’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  The two countries held an unprecedented summit in 2002, with Japan’s then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visiting the North Korean capital Pyongyang to meet Kim Jong Il – the father of now-leader Kim Jong Un.\n \n\n   \n  That visit was  the first time  a Japanese prime minister visited North Korea since the end of WWII.\n \n\n   \n  It was also the first time North Korea acknowledged its role in the abductions, after many years of denial. Kim Jong Il offered an apology at the time, saying the agents responsible had been punished, and promised to prevent it happening again, according to Japanese  government statements  at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The five detainees were returned to Japan the following month and reunited with their families – 20 to 30 years after their abduction.\n \n\n   \n  Koizumi returned to North Korea to meet Kim Jong Il a second time in 2004, during which the family members of several abductees were also allowed to return to Japan.\n \n\n   \n  No further repatriations have happened since then – and no progress has been made in talks between the two countries, despite repeated efforts by successive governments.\n \n\n   \n  Abe, who was assassinated in 2022, had  signaled a willingness  to meet Kim Jong Un without conditions to improve ties between their countries; several years later, then-leader Fumio Kishida also  conveyed his intention  to meet the North Korean leader.\n \n\n   \n  Each time, a meeting failed to materialize.

Bacon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Laterese Johnson has roughly a week and a half to two weeks of food benefits left to feed herself and her grandchildren, a reality that sunk in over the weekend when the government shutdown forced delays in payments for food assistance.\n \n\n   \n  “With the amount of SNAP benefits that I receive, it’s just enough to feed one person, but I have to share that with my grandchildren,” she told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on Saturday. “You know, it’s already a sacrifice.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson is one of millions of Americans, including food stamp recipients and federal workers, who are facing more uncertainty as the government shutdown enters its fifth week, with congressional Republicans and Democrats  remaining at odds  over a solution.\n \n\n   \n  While   two judges ruled last week that the Trump administration must tap into emergency funds for the roughly 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, it’s  unclear whether  they’ll receive their full benefits and when relief could come.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Agriculture’s contingency fund doesn’t have enough money to cover the total cost of the payments, which 3 million recipients should have received November 1. Remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested there could be progress toward ending the shutdown after Election Day this week, claiming that Democrats believe ending the impasse could harm voter turnout in key races in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. His comments came days after President Donald Trump began  ramping up pressure  on the GOP to unilaterally end the government shutdown by eliminating the Senate filibuster, a move Republican leaders  have opposed .\n \n\n   \n  Rachel Kent, a SNAP recipient, told CNN on Saturday that food should not be a political argument. “Congress can debate budgets all day, but you don’t debate whether children get to go to bed hungry,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The prolonged lapse in government funding continues to  stress food banks , charities and nonprofits set up to assist Americans in need, with federal workers going without pay also turning to those sources for aid.\n \n\n   \n  Nina Savransky, a former disaster response worker at the US Agency for International Development who volunteered at a food bank in the Washington, DC, area over the weekend, told CNN she was shocked to see the level of food insecurity brought on by the shutdown, particularly among federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  “I used to work in the disaster response bureau, and this is the disaster response now,” she told CNN. “It’s shocking to see this happen in the United States. This was support that we gave out to other countries that were unstable, and to feel that instability internally is … surprising. It’s difficult.”\n \n\n   \n     Food banks grapple with a surge in demand \n \n\n   \n  As the congressional stalemate persists, food banks across the county say the demand for their services is only rising and they will not be able to fill the gap made by delays to SNAP payments.\n \n\n   \n  “The potential is absolutely devastating, cataclysmic, in fact, for the whole nation, not only people experiencing hunger, but especially them,” Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America, told CNN’s Jessica Dean on Saturday. “For every one meal that the charitable food system can provide, SNAP has been providing nine. That’s why I’m saying ‘cataclysmic.’”\n \n\n   \n  Cara Durr, CEO of Food Bank of Alaska, said her group’s partner organization was seeing a lot of “concern and anxiety” over SNAP disruptions over the past few weeks, and that many of the communities they serve were already rattled by Typhoon Halong,  which tore through  remote, coastal communities in the state last month.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re already seeing an increase. We expect that will continue,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are reeling from the effects of a prolonged shutdown as it drags into its second month. At a food bank just outside Washington, DC, over the weekend, some became emotional as they described to CNN how the  uncertainty of their pay  and employment status has taken a toll on their finances and mental health.\n \n\n   \n  Colby, a State Department employee of 21 years who declined to give his last name, said he never imagined he’d be in line for food. “It’s different. We’ve been volunteering here for a while — we live a few blocks away. And now we’re on the receiving end. I’m just thankful it’s here.”\n \n\n   \n  Janis, a federal worker who declined to give her last name, became emotional describing how the shutdown has upended things for her family.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a big impact because now we have to choose either to feed ourselves or pay the bills,” said Janis, who did not want to disclose the agency she worked for.\n \n\n   \n  “We have young children, and we have to keep it together for them. It feels as if the government doesn’t care,” she said. “The holidays are coming — people are going to be hungry. We are the land of opportunity, and it doesn’t look like it.”\n \n\n   \n    Grocers brace for a hit\n \n\n   \n  The delays in food benefits are likely to affect not only recipients and the nonprofits that serve them, but could also lead to declining sales for grocers like Daweit Gebru, who co-owns Elmira Market with his brother in Washington, DC. He estimates that 60% to 65% of their business comes from customers using SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The market saw what was “possibly the worst time of business” last weekend, he said. Customers were more reluctant to spend money because of the shutdown, he said, and he and his brother were afraid to stock the market in case they didn’t sell anything. They forfeited part of their paychecks for the month to cover their staffs’ salaries and are now resorting to credit cards to stay afloat.\n \n\n   \n  At Zuppardo’s Family Market in Metairie, Louisiana, customer traffic remained steady over the weekend, according to owner Joseph Zuppardo. Louisiana’s Department of Health said it was moving forward with a state-funded program for SNAP households that include people who are elderly, disabled or children.\n \n\n   \n  The family-owned supermarket just outside of New Orleans has worked “extremely close under normal markups” to keep food affordable, according to Zuppardo. Long-term disruptions to SNAP could lead to as much as a 15% drop in sales, he said, adding, “we’re trying to do our part into lowering our costs.”\n \n\n   \n  At Joseph’s Market in Waterville, Maine, manager Sydney McKinnis said she is creating a November special priced under $150, potentially including basics like burgers, pork chops and bacon.\n \n\n   \n  McKinnis wants to keep it affordable “even if I have to go close to costs … just to be able to fill people’s freezers.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby and Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/mississippi-woman-kills-escaped-monkey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00.000Z","title":"Mississippi woman kills escaped research monkey fearing for her children’s safety","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 35-year-old professional chef and mother, Jessica Bond Ferguson, in Heidelberg, Mississippi, shot and killed an escaped rhesus monkey early Sunday, November 3, 2025, after being alarmed by her son’s sighting of the animal in their yard.

fearing for her children’s safety \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:05 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   Heidelberg, Mississippi (AP) —  One of the monkeys that  escaped last week  after a truck overturned on a Mississippi roadway was shot and killed early Sunday by a homeowner who says she feared for the safety of her children.\n \n\n   \n  Jessica Bond Ferguson said she was alerted early Sunday by her 16-year-old son, who said he thought he had seen a monkey running in the yard outside their home near Heidelberg, Mississippi. She got out bed, grabbed her firearm and her cellphone and stepped outside where she saw the monkey about 60 feet away.\n \n\n   \n  Bond Ferguson said she and other residents had been warned that the escaped monkeys carried diseases so she fired her gun.\n \n\n   \n  “I did what any other mother would do to protect her children,” Bond Ferguson, who has five children ranging in age from 4 to 16, told The Associated Press. “I shot at it and it just stood there, and I shot again, and he backed up and that’s when he fell.”\n \n\n   \n  The Jasper County Sheriff’s Office confirmed in a social media post that a homeowner had found one of the monkeys on their property Sunday morning but said the office didn’t have any details. The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks took possession of the monkey, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Before Bond Ferguson had gone out the door, she had called the police and was told to keep an eye on the monkey. But she said worried that if the monkey got away it would threaten children at another house.\n \n\n   \n  “If it attacked somebody’s kid, and I could have stopped it, that would be a lot on me,” said Bond Ferguson, a 35-year-old professional chef. “It’s kind of scary and dangerous that they are running around, and people have kids playing in their yards.”\n \n\n   \n  The Rhesus monkeys had been housed at the Tulane University National Biomedical Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, which routinely provides primates to scientific research organizations, according to the university. In a statement last week, Tulane said the monkeys do not belong to the university, and they were not being transported by the university.\n \n\n   \n  A truck carrying the monkeys overturned Tuesday on Interstate 59 north of Heidelberg. Of 21 the monkeys in the truck, 13 were found at the scene of the accident and arrived at their original destination last week, according to Tulane. Another five were killed in the hunt for them and three remained on the loose before Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The Mississippi Highway Patrol has said it was investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred about 100 miles from the state capital, Jackson.\n \n\n   \n  Rhesus monkeys typically weigh about 16 pounds and are among the most medically studied animals on the planet. Video recorded after the crash showed monkeys crawling through tall grass beside the interstate, where wooden crates labeled “live animals” were crumpled and strewn about.\n \n\n   \n  Jasper County Sheriff Randy Johnson had said Tulane officials reported the monkeys were not infectious, despite initial reports by the truck’s occupants warning that the monkeys were dangerous and harboring various diseases. Nonetheless, Johnson said the monkeys still needed to be “neutralized” because of their aggressive nature.\n \n\n   \n  The monkeys had recently received checkups confirming they were pathogen-free, Tulane said in a statement Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Rhesus macaques “are known to be aggressive,” according to the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. It said the agency’s conservation workers were working with sheriff’s officials in the search for the animals.\n \n\n   \n  The search comes about one year after  43 Rhesus macaques escaped  from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research because an employee didn’t fully lock an enclosure. Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, had set up traps to capture them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/media/trump-cbs-60-minutes-norah-odonnell-ellison-bari-weiss","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"10:20:00-05:00","title":"Trump spent 90 minutes with ‘60 Minutes’ — here’s what happened","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump appeared on '60 Minutes' one year after filing a lawsuit against CBS over editing a Kamala Harris interview.

Minutes’ — here’s what happened \n       \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:20 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Trump appeared on “60 Minutes” Sunday night, one year after suing the CBS show over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview — and he was well aware that his answers would similarly be trimmed for time.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to use that one,” Trump remarked after an awkward exchange with interviewer Norah O’Donnell about crime in Washington, D.C.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you,” Trump said at another point while praising the new owners of CBS.\n \n\n   \n  The newsmagazine’s producers evidently agreed that those moments weren’t the most newsworthy. CBS News aired about a third of O’Donnell’s sit-down with Trump on TV, and posted  most of the rest  on YouTube. The network also published the complete transcript of the 90-minute interview online.\n \n\n   \n  Both the TV broadcast and the transcript showed that O’Donnell sought to make the most of her time with Trump, pressing him on cost-of-living increases, foreign policy challenges, the government shutdown and other topics.\n \n\n   \n  O’Donnell asked pointed questions: “Are we going to war against Venezuela?” “When will you declare ‘mission accomplished’ on immigration?” “So you’re gonna send the military into American cities?”\n \n\n   \n  During a couple of key moments, O’Donnell pushed back on Trump’s talking points, for example, noting how “when the stock market is doing well, that doesn’t affect everybody.”\n \n\n   \n  Liberal commentators criticized O’Donnell for not interjecting and correcting Trump more often — reprising a decade-old debate within media industry circles about how to interview Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Norah let Trump lie and lie with barely any pushback or provision of corrective facts,” former MSNBC host Joy Reid commented on Bluesky.\n \n\n   \n  But it was not exactly a cushy interview. And O’Donnell’s questions generated lots of news. In one clip that ricocheted around social media, Trump said immigration raids in the US “haven’t gone far enough.” In another viral clip, Trump said, “I don’t know who he is” when asked about Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, whom  he pardoned last month .\n \n\n   \n  Trump seemingly had little to say when O’Donnell brought up “those that are suffering with cost-of-living increases and saying they’re living paycheck to paycheck.” He suggested people should blame his predecessor, Joe Biden, and made generic pledges about lowering the price of gas and fixing healthcare.\n \n\n   \n  “But Mr. President, with all due respect, you’ve been talking about fixing the healthcare insurance plan since 2015,” O’Donnell said at one point.\n \n\n   \n  “Sure. And you can’t do it because of the Democrats,” Trump responded.\n \n\n   \n    Praising David Ellison and Bari Weiss\n \n\n   \n  Sit-down interviews with Trump have been few and far between during his second term, so every question and every answer gets attention.\n \n\n   \n  And Sunday’s “60 Minutes” interview was even more noteworthy since Trump cares deeply about the newsmagazine but hadn’t said yes to an interview since 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Trump fielded O’Donnell’s questions on Friday, one year to the day after he filed a frivolous lawsuit against “60 Minutes” over its pre-election interview with Harris.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit — along with Trump’s public attacks and threats against CBS station licenses — shook the network and created a conundrum for parent company Paramount, which needed the Trump administration’s approval for its then-pending merger with Skydance Media.\n \n\n   \n  The Paramount board decided to strike a settlement deal, paying $16 million to Trump’s future presidential library to end the litigation.\n \n\n   \n  The settlement was widely criticized, including by journalists and entertainers at CBS. “The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert likened it to a “big fat bribe.” (Colbert’s show was cancelled soon thereafter, in  what the network cast  as a financial, not political, decision.)\n \n\n   \n  Within days of the settlement being finalized last July, the Trump administration approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance Media, clearing the way for Skydance boss David Ellison, son of the Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, to take control of CBS.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has kept tabs on the Paramount ownership change and has expressed hope that CBS will be “fairer” as a result.\n \n\n   \n  “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They’re friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine,” Trump said last month. “They will make the right decisions,” he added. “They’re going to revitalize CBS — hopefully, they’ll bring it back to its former glory.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also flattered the Ellisons during the “60 Minutes” taping, saying, “I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump specifically brought up David Ellison’s recent hiring of Bari Weiss as CBS News editor-in-chief, albeit not by name.\n \n\n   \n  “The young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great — from what I know. I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person,” Trump said after bringing up the Paramount settlement. (This is one of the parts of the interview that Trump suggested could be trimmed.)\n \n\n   \n  Trump falsely said “60 Minutes” was “forced to pay me a lot of money,” when in fact the settlement was a corporate calculation; CBS could have decided to fight the lawsuit in court, and many legal experts believed the network would have won.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also misstated the timeline, claiming the Harris interview “was election-changing, two nights before the election,” when in fact it aired one month before election day.\n \n\n   \n  CBS disclosed the settlement controversy in O’Donnell’s introduction to the interview broadcast on Sunday night.

General Motors and Ford reduced their tariff cost estimates substantially, with GM cutting its forecast by $500 million and Ford halving its 2025 cost. Tariff-related losses, such as Volkswagen’s $1.3 billion Q3 loss, were less than projected. Crucially, the elimination of financial penalties for failing emissions standards in July 2025 saved automakers billions, reducing vehicle production costs by 3–5%. As a result, companies like Ford and GM have shifted production toward more profitable gasoline vehicles (e.g., F-150, Super Duty, and Michigan plant changes). Although tariffs have increased car prices by about 4%, automakers have not passed costs directly to consumers.

Here’s how they avoided the worst of it \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When President Donald Trump introduced his tariff policy   earlier this year, it looked like a disaster for automakers. But even with US tariffs on imported cars and parts, it has shaped up to be a pretty good time for car companies.\n \n\n   \n  Most automakers, even US-based ones, import some cars and most parts. But car companies’ dire cost estimates have decreased as tariffs keep getting rolled back, bit by bit.\n \n\n   \n  More   importantly for automakers’ bottom lines, the financial penalties for not meeting fuel efficiency rules have all but vanished. Those regulatory savings could eventually offset the cost of tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  All in all, one could argue that auto industry profits could end up better off than they were before Trump took office in January, a surprising outcome as automakers’ huge investments in electric vehicles in recent years were also being undercut by Trump pulling the plug on the federal support of electric vehicles they had counted on when making that massive bet.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s definitely favorable,” said Jeff Schuster, an independent auto analyst about the changes since auto tariffs were first announced in March. “There are so many moving pieces, it’s hard to isolate. But things are definitely better off than anyone expected.”\n \n\n   \n    Tariff costs not as bad as feared\n \n\n   \n  Automakers were close to panic when Trump announced plans for a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, including those from Mexico and Canada, since all companies depend on imported parts to build at US assembly plants and almost all import from those neighboring countries. Ford CEO Jim Farley said the tariffs “would blow a hole in the US industry that we’ve never seen.”\n \n\n   \n  But it turned out it wasn’t as bad as they feared, as Trump continued to reduce the worst of the duties’ impact almost immediately. General Motors and Ford, which had forecast billions in annual costs, have each reduced those assessments. GM trimmed its $5 billion estimate by $500 million last month. Ford cut its estimated tariff cost for 2025 in half, from $2 billion to $1 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Volkswagen reported a 1 billion euro loss ($1.3 billion) in the third quarter and said that the tariffs would cost it up to $5.8 billion this year. But some of the loss was due to other problems with its European EVs and a reorganization at Porsche.\n \n\n   \n  While tariff costs have also trimmed automakers’ profits, companies managed to beat expectations. For example, GM’s adjusted earnings per share had been forecast to fall 23% in the third quarter. Instead, it fell just 5%. Even the Volkswagen loss was less than a quarter of forecasts.\n \n\n   \n  Even automakers from Asia and Europe have been able to weather the storm, since they build a significant share of their US-sold vehicles in America.   \n \n\n   \n  Hyundai CEO José Muñoz told reporters in New York in September that even with the US tariffs, the United States, not South Korea, is Hyundai’s most profitable market. He expects that to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “Tariffs are still a headwind,” said Dan Ives, analyst with Wedbush Securities. “But so far they’ve been digested well.”\n \n\n   \n  And further tariff reductions are likely if the administration reaches a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico —   two of the largest sources of imported cars and auto parts.\n \n\n   \n  Trump recently halted Canadian trade negotiations after an ad funded by the province of Ontario featured a 1987 anti-tariff speech by former President Ronald Reagan. But experts think there will be some kind of trade deal in the future.\n \n\n   \n  A free trade deal with South Korea, another source of imported vehicles, would also help reduce tariff costs for not just Hyundai and Kia but also General Motors, which builds some of the cheaper cars at its US dealerships in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  The blunted tariff impact has also benefitted car buyers.\n \n\n   \n  Companies have not passed on the increased tariff costs to consumers, at least not directly. However, there have been some quiet moves by automakers to recoup some of the costs of the duties, such as charging for equipment that had once been included in the price, or ending production on less profitable models.\n \n\n   \n  As a results, the average price of a new car purchase stands at just around $50,000, according to estimates from Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book, up about 4% from a year ago.\n \n\n   \n    Big savings from regulatory changes\n \n\n   \n  While tariffs capture most of the headlines about government action, there’s been a less publicized windfall for automakers: the end of financial penalties for violating emissions standards.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, automakers avoided fines for selling too many gasoline vehicles by purchasing so-called regulatory credits from companies that fell below emission standards, like electric vehicle maker Tesla.\n \n\n   \n  But those penalties were eliminated in July’s tax and spending bill, saving the automakers billions. Ford CFO Sherry House told reporters last month it will no longer purchase the $2.5 billion worth of regulatory credits it had planned to buy in the future.\n \n\n   \n  Ives said that no longer having to buy credits should reduce the cost of building a vehicle by 3% to 5%. Automakers can also ramp up sales of the more profitable large trucks and SUVs that were previously capped by emissions levels.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Ford announced it was increasing production of its F-150 and F-Series Super Duty in 2026 by more than 50,000 trucks to meet demand.   GM also revealed plans to shift production of one of its Michigan plants from EVs, which have been losing money, to profitable gasoline powered vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  “As the regulatory costs go away, that does paint a much better picture for the health of the industry than anyone thought would be passed,” said Schuster. “The near-term outlook is much more favorable than in April.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/asia/maldives-generational-smoking-ban-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"1119-11-02","timeOfPublication":"11:19:00-04:00","title":"Maldives Enacts World’s First Generational Smoking Ban","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Maldives has become the first country in the world to implement a nationwide generational tobacco ban, prohibiting the purchase, sale, and use of tobacco for anyone born after January 1, 2007.

buying and selling tobacco illegal for anyone born after January 1, 2007.\n \n\n   \n  The ban took effect on Saturday in the South Asian archipelago, “marking a historic milestone in the nation’s

The bill would ban tobacco for anyone born after January 1, 2009, and strengthen regulations on the sale of tobacco and vaping products.\n \n\n   \n  A number of British health leaders signed  an open letter  last week calling for the bill’s passage, and decrying delays in the process so far.

Spinner Sharma took the final wicket of the match and returned bowling figures of 5-39 from 9.3 overs.\n \n\n   \n  “We were waiting for this moment, and now this moment has come,” India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said, reflecting on a triumph after two previous finals defeats. “Now we want to make this a habit.”\n \n\n   \n  India was the last of the four teams to qualify for the semifinals, but then beat defending champion and seven-time winner Australia by five wickets to reach the final. South Africa beat four-time champion England by 125 runs to reach the final for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  Winning at home gave India its first major women’s cricket title. Harmanpreet Kaur’s squad was the first, first-time champion since 2000, when New Zealand ended the long dominance of Australia and England.\n \n\n   \n    Player of the match\n \n\n   \n  Verma - who was drafted in last week for the injured Pratika Rawal - took 2-36 with the ball and was voted player of the match.\n \n\n   \n  “God sent me to do something good, and that was reflected today,” the 21-year-old Verma said. “I only focused on making runs today. My mind was clear.”\n \n\n   \n  Before her five-wicket haul, Sharma (58) posted her third half-century of the tournament to help India reached the second highest total in a World Cup final after Australia’s 356-5 against England in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  She finished the tournament with 22 wickets and 215 runs in nine matches to capture the player of the tournament honors.\n \n\n   \n  “I enjoyed myself with both bat and ball,” Sharma said of the final. “We were not relaxed at any time, but we were calm.

She added 52 off 51 balls with Sune Luus, who scored 25.\n \n\n   \n  India lost its review in desperation to get Wolvaardt dismissed, and then gambled with Verma’s gentle off-breakers.\n \n\n   \n  The ploy worked with another double blow - Verma picked up two wickets in six deliveries to have South Africa in trouble at 123-4 in 22.1 overs. She sent back Luus with an easy return catch, and then had Marizanne Kapp (4) caught behind.\n \n\n   \n  Wolvaardt tried to keep the chase alive through partnerships with Sinalo Jafta (16) and Annerie Dercksen, who scored 35. In doing so, she reached a century off 96 balls.\n \n\n   \n  Sharma bowled Dercksen and then blunted South Africa’s chances when she Wolvaardt caught by Kaur in the 42nd over with the total at 220-7.\n \n\n   \n  Verma played a key role in setting the Proteas a challenging target after the final was delayed by two hours because of rain.\n \n\n   \n  She hit seven fours and two sixes and shared a 104-run opening stand with Smriti Mandhana (45).\n \n\n   \n  After Chloe Tryon dismissed Mandhana in the 18th over, Verma combined with Jemimah Rodrigues (24) to add a further 62 before both were out.\n \n\n   \n  From 171-3 in 29.4 overs, skipper Harmanpreet tried to restore the momentum but was bowled by Nonkululeko Mlaba in the 39th over. She scored only 20 runs, but combined with Sharma for 52 runs off 56 balls.\n \n\n   \n  Sharma steadied the innings with a run-a-ball 58, including three fours and a six and shared a pivotal 47-run, sixth-wicket partnership with Richa Ghosh that helped set up the winning total.\n \n\n   \n  The Board of Control for Cricket in India punctuated the tournament with a social media post to reflect the historic victory, topping the congratulatory message with the letters: C.H.A.M.P.I.O.N.S.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/harvard-university-goldenson-explosion","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Officials investigate ‘intentional’ explosion at Harvard University medical building that left no injuries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An apparently intentional explosion occurred in the Goldenson medical building at Harvard University early Saturday, November 1, 2025, prompting a joint investigation by Harvard University Police, Boston police, and the FBI.

Andrew Cuomo , who is attempting a political comeback as an independent, and Republican Curtis Silwa in a mayoral race with significant implications for the future of the city and the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  And in California, the race to redraw  congressional district boundaries  ahead of next year’s battle for majority control of the US House of Representatives faces a critical moment.\n \n\n   \n  A special election in Texas caps an important set of odd-year elections. Here are the races and issues to watch Tuesday:\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Cuomo are facing off a second time in the New York City mayoral election, after Mamdani — a  democratic socialist  who has energized young voters and progressives with his go-anywhere, do-anything campaign tactics and a message centered on affordability — handily defeated the former governor in the Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor’s race is a signal moment for a Democratic Party looking for its way out of the political wilderness. Similar dynamics — progressives against moderates and insiders against outsiders — could play out in primary elections next spring. Democrats can also draw lessons from how questions of  support for Israel  have played in the race, and from Mamdani’s approach to social media and publicity, including appearing on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  Some national Democrats — most notably the party’s top two figures in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York — have been slow to embrace Mamdani. Jeffries  endorsed him  only in late October, and Schumer has not said who he is supporting in the mayor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  Before  heading out to rallies  in Virginia and New Jersey on Saturday, former President Barack Obama called Mamdani. He has not endorsed the nominee — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections — and that did not change in the call. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Across the Hudson River, voters in the traditionally blue state of New Jersey will choose their replacement for term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\n \n\n   \n  Amid tax hikes and soaring utility costs, affordability has taken center stage in the election. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican who is endorsed by Trump and has praised the president’s performance in his second term, has sought to localize the race —  pitching himself  as the consummate “Jersey guy” and casting Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who moved to the state after a Navy career, as an outsider.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill and Democrats, meanwhile, have emphasized Ciattarelli’s links to Trump — a potentially decisive factor in a state with 800,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. One point of emphasis: Trump’s cancellation of funding for the Gateway Tunnel, a rail project linking New Jersey and New York City.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey has typically leaned blue, but Ciattarelli came close to winning in 2021, and the state shifted hard in Trump’s direction in 2024: He lost by just 6 percentage points, after a 16-point drubbing there in 2020.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Four years after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won a major upset, tapping into parents’ anger over local school boards, his lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, is seeking to replace him with a campaign centered on transgender policies, particularly in schools.\n \n\n   \n  But polls suggest her Democratic opponent, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, has a clear advantage headed into Election Day in a state that three times voted against Trump. Democrats have relentlessly tied Earle-Sears to Trump, and she has not sought to distance herself from the president.\n \n\n   \n  At a rally with Obama in Norfolk on Saturday, Spanberger described the election as a chance for Democrats to send a signal to the nation. “Amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington, Virginia can and will flip statewide seats from red to blue,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  None of the states holding elections on Tuesday are typically considered swing states in presidential elections. But Republicans were able to sweep statewide races four years ago. And with the Virginia’s proximity to Washington, it is home to hundreds of thousands of federal government workers who are affected by the Trump administration’s downsizing of the federal workforce and the government shutdown. Its gubernatorial election might be the closest to a true test of Trump’s performance this year.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown closer races down ballot in Virginia, where Republican John Reid and Democrat Ghazala Hashmi are facing off for lieutenant governor. In the contest for attorney general, Republicans have what could be their best chance to win Tuesday as GOP incumbent Jason Miyares faces Democrat Jay Jones, who has been  dogged by controversy  surrounding violent text messages he sent in 2022.\n \n\n   \n    Issue to watch: Utility costs\n \n\n   \n  The economy is a perennial campaign issue, with voters often expressing concerns about prices at the grocery store or at gas pumps. This year’s pocketbook metric is one less often discussed:  utility costs .\n \n\n   \n  Electricity prices across the country, which have  sharply increased  since 2020, have jumped over the last year, introducing a new financial strain for voters in places like New Jersey and Virginia. Candidates in both states have featured energy costs in their television ads and campaign speeches.\n \n\n   \n  Utility costs have become a particularly salient issue in New Jersey, where residential electricity prices have jumped nearly 21% over the past year compared with a 6% increase nationwide, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Ciattarelli has said Democrats’ push for clean energy is to blame, while Sherrill has said she will fix the issue by freezing utility rates, a proposal that has drawn skepticism from Murphy, the outgoing Democratic governor.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump appears to be aware of the political potency of the issue. In a tele-rally for Ciattarelli last month, the president repeatedly turned to talking about energy costs — an indication the issue could be front and center in next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n    California’s redistricting battle\n \n\n   \n  California’s vote on  a measure known as Proposition 50  will set the stage for next year’s midterm battle for control of the US House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will decide whether to green-light the Democratic plan spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom to set aside the congressional districts drawn by the state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission in favor of a gerrymandered map aimed at improving Democrats’ chances of winning five GOP-held seats.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a response to Texas, where the legislature approved and Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law new maps intended to help Republicans win five more seats — improving the party’s odds of retaining its House majority.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, widely viewed as a 2028 presidential contender, sought an answer that would neutralize those Texas gains. But unlike in Texas, California voters have to sign off on the plan to replace the nonpartisan commission’s maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections — before switching back to new, commission-drawn maps in the next decade, after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  A “yes” vote would be a big win for Democrats, who have fewer avenues to respond after Republicans also redrew Missouri’s maps to add one more seat, with Indiana convening a special legislative session on Monday to potentially add one or two more GOP seats and North Carolina moving to add one more Republican-leaning district. It would also be a milestone for Newsom, as he and a slew of other Democratic governors seek to position themselves as Trump’s strongest opponents ahead of potential presidential runs.\n \n\n   \n    Pennsylvania Supreme Court retention\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, voters must determine whether to keep three Democratic members of the state Supreme Court — a decision with potentially  significant ramifications  in the coming months and years in the crucial presidential battleground.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have a 5-2 majority on the state’s high court. The three incumbents on Tuesday’s ballot face yes-or-no questions of whether they’ll be retained for new 10-year terms. If they aren’t, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro would appoint interim replacements until elections for new justices were held in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  A change in party control of the state Supreme Court could have far-reaching implications for the 2028 presidential race, upcoming midterms and future redistricting. Ahead of the 2020 and 2024 elections, the Democratic majority sided with Democrats on key cases related to mail-in deadlines, provisional ballots and signature matching.\n \n\n   \n    Texas House special election\n \n\n   \n  The largely Democratic, Houston-area 18th Congressional District in Texas has been without representation in Washington for most of the last 16 months.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024,  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee  died. Her daughter, Erica Lee Carter, won the special election to fill the vacancy. But that special election was held the same day as the 2024 general election, which was won by former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner — who hadn’t been on the ballot in the special election.\n \n\n   \n  Turner  died in early March . Abbott, a Republican, scheduled the special election for eight months later — a move that gave the House GOP more breathing room as it moved toward passage of Trump’s landmark tax and domestic policy bill.\n \n\n   \n  This special election, a jungle primary that will go to a runoff featuring the top two finishers unless one tops 50% of the vote on Tuesday, has drawn several high-profile candidates. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, who has technically resigned to run for Congress but continues to serve, is among the Democrats, as are state Rep. Jolanda Jones and Amanda Edwards, a former Houston City Council member who lost in the 2024 primary to Jackson Lee. Republican Carmen Montiel, a Venezuelan American real estate agent and former TV journalist, is the highest-profile member of her party in the race.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/justice-department-tells-congress-trump-doesnt-need-its-approval-for-military-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"14:37:00Z","title":"Justice Department Tells Congress Trump Doesn’t Need Its Approval for Military Strikes on Alleged Drug Boats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, through its Office of Legal Counsel under T.

Elliot Gaiser, told select Senate and House lawmakers on Thursday that the US strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean did not trigger the law’s requirements because they don’t meet the definition of hostilities and did not require a declaration of war from Congress, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Gaiser was drawing on a classified legal opinion produced by his office that justifies the strikes by equating drug cartels with terrorists and focuses on the death caused by the drugs brought to American shores, the sources said. Gaiser emphasized the fact that the US military wasn’t being attacked in response to the strikes as part his argument that America was not at war, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has carried out at least 15 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels since early September, killing a total of 64 people, according to a CNN tally. The latest known strike  occurred  on Saturday in the Caribbean, killing three people.\n \n\n   \n  Some legal experts have said the military strikes could violate US and international law.  Democratic lawmakers , and at least  one Republican , have criticized the administration for not being more forthcoming with details on the legal justification for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration notified Congress in early September that it had struck an alleged drug vessel. Under the 1973 War Powers Resolution, that notification started a 60-day clock, after which the administration has to either cease the use of military force, get an extension on the clock or a war authorization from Congress,  according  to legal scholars.\n \n\n   \n  But Gaiser told lawmakers that the administration does not need to seek an extension of that 60-day clock, which expires on Monday, because the law doesn’t apply in this case, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN  first reported  on the existence of the OLC opinion, which legal experts said appears to justify an open-ended war against a secret list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers. The opinion appears designed to give the president power to designate drug traffickers as enemy combatants and have them summarily killed without legal review, those experts said. Historically, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has requested comment from the White House and the Justice Department on the congressional briefings and the administration’s legal rationale for striking the alleged drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Post first  reported  on Gaiser’s briefing of lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump issued an executive order on the first day of his second term designating certain drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, giving the US military greater leeway to attack them.

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the agents were conducting an immigration enforcement operation at the time. It said agents had observed a “red vehicle” that was “aggressively” tailing their vehicle, and when the agents turned, the car crashed into Border Patrol. DHS said a “hostile crowd” gathered around their vehicle and began “verbally abusing them and spitting on them.”\n \n\n   \n  But Mayor Daniel Biss disputed the agency’s account of the incident in an interview with CNN, calling DHS “a bunch of liars.”\n \n\n   \n  He told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday he is opening two investigations into the incident: one into the “violence” federal agents used against people he described as “innocent bystanders,” and one into the vehicle collision. The Border Patrol agents “deliberately caused a car accident” by intentionally braking while being followed by the red vehicle, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t like being followed, because they don’t like being watched, because they don’t want the world to know what they’re doing,” said the mayor of the Chicago suburb. “They forced this car accident, and then they started literally beating up innocent bystanders.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has asked DHS about the mayor’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  The incident comes amid growing scrutiny of  the aggressive tactics  used by Border Patrol and ICE, including against US citizens. Multiple people have been  shot by federal agents  during immigration enforcement operations, and  multiple car crashes  and alleged “rammings” involving federal agents have occurred as DHS sets out to meet  high arrest targets  set by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said three US citizens were arrested “as a result of their violence against law enforcement” in Evanston on Friday, but the agency did not specify what the three had allegedly done, and did not identify them or list any charges against them.\n \n\n   \n  In response to CNN’s questions about the videos showing the man being punched in the head, a DHS spokesperson sent a statement saying a Border Patrol agent had “delivered several defensive strikes” to a person he was arresting. The statement said the man had kicked the agent and “grabbed the (agent’s) genitals and squeezed them” during the arrest, but that account was not readily supported by the video.\n \n\n   \n  Video shows one agent restraining the man, then dragging him around as another agent helps pin him to the ground. As one agent punches the man several times, the man screams, “Help me, help me.” Agents appear to fight off a screaming crowd trying to help the man by pushing them away and threatening them with pepper spray.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t breathe,” the man says as the agent continues to kneel on him. The agents then drag him into a vehicle, his left shoe lying on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  Biss said that after the man was arrested, federal agents “took him away and booked him and drove him around” but did not take him to receive medical care. The man was “not in good shape” after the arrest, he said. CNN has asked DHS whether it took the man to receive medical care.\n \n\n   \n  “This is lawlessness,” the mayor said. “This is an outrage, and everyone’s got to stand up against it.”\n \n\n   \n  By arresting three US citizens, he said, federal agents “weren’t even trying to enforce immigration. They were just trying to go after dissent.”\n \n\n   \n  Following a new Evanston policy, local police obtained the badge numbers of the federal agents involved in Friday’s arrests, Biss said. “Now we have the first step toward accountability, by being able to identify them,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  City officials are “thinking through options, including going to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, or potentially communicating with our state’s attorney to figure out the right way to demand justice for our residents who were assaulted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Gov.

and don’t know about the alleged terror plot thwarted by FBI in Michigan \n       \n  By Holly Yan, Ray Sanchez, Leigh Waldman and Jeff Winter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:17 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A cryptic reference to “pumpkin day.” An online chat about an ISIS-inspired attack. A shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s.\n \n\n   \n  A  potential terrorist attack over Halloween weekend  was thwarted by the FBI, according to a social media post by agency Director Kash Patel.\n \n\n   \n  Details of the alleged plot are scarce but two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case told CNN about the “pumpkin day” reference, the online chat and the shooting range activity.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know and don’t know about the potential terror attack:\n \n\n   \n    Two arrests, and others being questioned\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others were being questioned, according to two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case. Their ages range from 16 to 20s.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Amir Makled, who represents one of the adults in custody, told CNN Sunday that three people have been arrested, two were questioned and an additional two people were questioned and released. CNN has reached out to the FBI for clarification.\n \n\n   \n  Patel  wrote on X  the FBI “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  “The FBI swept out from the Detroit field office last night and through this morning, taking people into custody, executing search warrants and doing subpoenas for phones, computers and other material,” John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Makled urged people to wait for “verifiable facts” before jumping to conclusions. His client, a 20-year-old US citizen who has not been publicly identified, is cooperating with authorities and has not been formally charged, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney said he is concerned about “rhetoric that’s harmful to the large Arab and Muslim population in the state of Michigan, specifically in Dearborn” since reports of the alleged plot emerged.\n \n\n   \n  Laraib Irfan said he woke up to what he described as loud bangs from “smoke bombs” in the predawn and saw FBI agents outside his neighbor’s house two doors down on their quiet Dearborn street. He said he is “close” to the family that lives in the home and is “just trying to find answers” about what happened. Some occupants of the home were handcuffed outside.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re like family. They’re like friends. We’re always talking with each other,” he said of the neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t believe that something like that would even go down on my block,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    How the alleged plot was uncovered\n \n\n   \n  The ISIS-inspired plot unfolded in online chatrooms, according to the two law enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  An FBI undercover person was introduced into the chatroom in the early stages of discussion, the officials added.\n \n\n   \n  “This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” said Miller, citing conversations with law enforcement officials who had been briefed.\n \n\n   \n  The participants discussed whether to carry out an ISIS-inspired plot in the US – “though what that plot was, when that plot would be, what the target would be, was unclear as they discussed various options in terms of timing,” Miller said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what the two people arrested were charged with and whether charges have been filed.\n \n\n   \n  Miller said the FBI moved in this week when a group of people who were being monitored “went to a shooting range with AK-47s and other weapons, fired a large number of rounds of ammunition, practiced tactical high-speed reloads, and in the discussions it was picked up a reference to what we’re told is ‘pumpkin day’ – a possible reference to Halloween.”\n \n\n   \n  The individuals taken into custody had discussed in their communications whether they were ready to carry out an attack, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said. Some said they needed more time and training, but a younger member of the group had said that it was time to act, two officials added.\n \n\n   \n  There was also a discussion at one point about taking a one-day trip to New York City to see the sights, including visiting Rockefeller Center and looking at the Statue of Liberty, the officials said. There was no talk about the trip being a reconnaissance for an attack, but the conversation caught the attention of both the FBI and the NYPD as the investigation continued.\n \n\n   \n    ‘No current threat to public safety’\n \n\n   \n  The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed “the FBI in Michigan were present in the cities of Dearborn and Inkster … conducting law enforcement activities,” spokesperson Jordan Hall told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no current threat to public safety.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dearborn Police Department said it “has been made aware that the FBI conducted operations in the City of Dearborn.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to assure our residents that there is no threat to the community at this time,” the police department said.\n \n\n   \n  In the city of Inkster, the FBI carried out “law enforcement activities at a storage facility located on Michigan Avenue,” Police Chief Tamika L. Jenkins said.\n \n\n   \n  She said local FBI agents confirmed there is no threat to residents. But to assuage any concerns, Inkster police “will have additional personnel deployed throughout the evening to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, particularly those participating in Halloween festivities,” the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the FBI and Michigan State Police.\n \n\n   \n  “I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” she posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/hegseth-bars-military-officials-from-discussing-drug-boat-strikes-with-congress-without-prior-approval","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"16:51:00Z","title":"Hegseth Bars Military Officials From Discussing Drug Boat Strikes With Congress Without Prior Approval","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has issued a broad directive requiring Defense Department personnel to seek prior approval from his office’s legislative affairs unit before discussing any 'sensitive military operations,' including strikes on suspected drug boats in Latin America, with Congress.

This review is for processes internal to the Department and does not change how or from whom Congress receives information,” said Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesman.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Rep.

Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said.

They argue that the reductions in force (RIFs) — such as the layoff of seven out of nine employees in the Bureau of Indian Education — are undermining critical services in education, health, and food security. These cuts violate long-standing treaty obligations, with leaders asserting that services like SNAP, Head Start, and Indian Health Service programs are not discretionary but legally binding. The situation is worsened by a lack of transparency and the impact of external disasters like Typhoon Halong in Alaska, which has destroyed food supplies and power. Even though federal judges have ruled to maintain SNAP funding, the uncertainty and erosion of federal presence have left tribes struggling to meet basic needs, particularly in winter months.

\nUpdated: \n        12:11 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Native American leaders warned senators last week that mass layoffs and potential benefit lapses are making this government shutdown more painful for their communities and insisted that the federal government fulfill its treaty obligations with tribal nations.\n \n\n   \n  “The shutdown reductions in force have crept into our classrooms, our early childhood programs and our homes. What began as a budget dispute in Washington has become a daily crisis in Indian country,” Kerry Bird, ﻿president of the board of directors of the National Indian Education Association, told senators during a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Bird and other witnesses were invited by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to testify about how layoffs, also called reductions in force or RIFs, and the shutdown have affected their communities. They emphasized that in reducing the number of the federal employees who interface often with tribes, especially on issues of education, economic development, health and food security, the administration has left Native communities isolated and unsupported at a time when many federal benefits like SNAP are delayed.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who has long been critical of the Trump administration’s mass layoffs, chaired the hearing, and was the only Republican in attendance.\n \n\n   \n  “The loss of employees with deep institutional knowledge and long standing relationships with Native communities, weakens the effectiveness of these crucial federal programs,” Murkowski said as the hearing opened.\n \n\n   \n  As the hearing began, Bird told senators that he had just been told that seven of nine employees at the Office of Indian Education under the Department of Education had been laid off.\n \n\n   \n  “That means no one to process grants, approved budgets or support in tribal education departments and Indian parent committees. If these terminations are allowed to go into full effect, Indian education programs as we know them would be functionally eliminated,” said Bird.\n \n\n   \n  “When our ancestors signed treaties with the United States, they did so in exchange for certain guarantees. One of these was that our children and our children’s children would be educated this obligation is not a discretionary choice, it is the payment on a debt owed,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, who has been one of the few Democrats to break with her party and vote for the GOP-backed stopgap funding resolution to reopen the government, told CNN last week that she believes this shutdown is potentially more harmful to Native communities than past shutdowns have been.\n \n\n   \n  “Yeah, I think, what I hear from the tribes are because of the RIFs, because of the lack of a federal workforce, they’re already getting hit, and now, if some of them are being impacted by the shutdown because they don’t have access to SNAP funding, like some of my tribes, yeah, it’s a double whammy,” said Cortez Masto. “There is a concern that we’ve got to live up to just our existing obligations to the tribes, that the federal government doesn’t and we’ve got to do more.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have a trust and treaty obligation to the tribes, whether there’s a government shutdown or not, and the federal government has a role to play, and we have to continue to support that obligation,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Sarah Harris, the vice chairwoman of the Mohegan Tribe and the secretary of the United South and Eastern Tribes, said that the uncertainty surrounding the shutdown has been particularly harmful.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that one of the things that has been incredibly challenging for tribes during shutdown and with the RIFs is just the complete lack of transparency,” said Harris.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no end in sight, and there’s no information. I mean, tribal governments are resilient and resourceful, and we are problem solvers, but it’s difficult to know what you’re even solving for – if its short term or if it’s long term – and so I think everyone right now is just, you know, dealing with what’s in front of them and trying to find stopgap measures to provide for our tribal citizens, until, you know, there’s more clarity,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Two federal judges ruled on Friday that the administration must use emergency funds to continue paying for some SNAP benefits, however that doesn’t cancel out the uncertainty for Native communities.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, the top Democrat on the panel, emphasized the government’s obligations to Native American communities in his opening remarks at the hearing, saying, “when the federal government shuts down, our trust and treaty and legal obligations do not vanish, but they are put at risk. Promises to provide health care, housing, education and public safety, among so many other critical services, are all on the chopping block.”\n \n\n   \n  Schatz added, “Native programs are not DEI spending, they are not charity, they are the law; attempting to cancel funds for Native programs, RIFing more than 4200 federal employees and eliminating tribal consultation policies, that’s not the United States government meeting its trust and legal obligations.”\n \n\n   \n  Murkowski, who represents a state with a large Native America population, emphasized that federal layoffs and potential benefit lapses are disproportionately affecting Native communities, even when they aren’t carried out in agencies specifically tasked with working with tribal nations.\n \n\n   \n  “I think they kind of like, block them off – It’s the Bureau of Indian Education, it’s the Bureau of Indian Affairs, it’s the Indian Health Service. And so, it’s like, okay, but what they’re failing to recognize, perhaps, is how many other programs are serving tribal citizens across this country. And so whether it’s SNAP or whether it’s LIHEAP or whether it’s Head Start, none of those programs have the word Indian in them, but the impact to American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians may be, may be disproportionate,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Murkowski also noted that her Native constituents are particularly concerned about having to choose between food and fuel as winter sets in. The damage from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, which hit Alaska around two weeks into the shutdown, has also complicated matters.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s something that for many, is really frightening,” she said, adding “There’s a lot of anxiety when it comes to food security right now. And again, in Alaska, this is the time of year where, okay, nothing is growing. You’ve either, you’ve either gotten your moose or your caribou or your fish, or you haven’t. And for those who were impacted by this, this devastating typhoon two weeks ago, almost all those in those villages have lost their food supply for the winter, the power out, and so food security is a is a big, big deal right now, as we enter wintertime.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"13:24:00-05:00","title":"Timeline of US Strikes on Boats That Have Killed 64","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States military, under the direction of President Donald Trump, launched a series of 15 strikes between September 2 and November 1, 2025, targeting 16 boats believed to be transporting narcotics and affiliated with designated terrorist organizations like Tren de Aragua and Colombian cartels.

that have killed 64 \n       \n  By Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, Matt Stiles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:24 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has killed 64 people in 15 strikes that have destroyed 16 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There have been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, 27th.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor.

  1:02 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A well-armed jihadist group affiliated with al Qaeda is closing in on Bamako, the capital of Mali. The country’s military junta and their Russian partners are struggling to counter the jihadis, who now hold sway in many parts of the huge Sahelian country.\n \n\n   \n    What’s happening now\n \n\n   \n  Fuel is running short in Bamako as militants belonging to a group called Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam al-Muslimin (JNIM) cut roads to the capital, attack military patrols and ambush tanker trucks.\n \n\n   \n  As the situation deteriorates, the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany among others have urged their nationals to leave Bamako. On Thursday, the UK warned its citizens to “leave immediately by commercial flight if you judge it safe to do so,” while the  US State Department  cited the “unpredictability of Bamako’s security situation” in encouraging Americans to leave.\n \n\n   \n  Video and images from the city in recent days show long lines of motorbikes and other vehicles queuing at gas stations. Some residents have accused the police of sequestering fuel supplies, according to local media. Schools and colleges closed because of the shortages.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two months, JNIM has stepped up attacks on fuel supplies, ambushing tankers on the roads from Ivory Coast and Senegal.\n \n\n   \n  In one attack in mid-September, the militants attacked a convoy of more than 100 fuel trucks, setting fire to half of them, according to Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which maps conflicts.\n \n\n   \n  The militants have seized large amounts of weaponry from government forces and demonstrated their ability to use drones, says the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), which analyzes terrorist groups.\n \n\n   \n  JNIM “has diversified its tactics” terrorism analyst Daniele Garofalo told CNN, stepping up its “economic warfare campaigns with roadblocks, extortion/taxation and fuel blockades.”\n \n\n   \n  In a video released last month, JNIM spokesman Abu Hudheifa al-Bambari demanded people cooperate in areas controlled by the group by stopping at its checkpoints and advised them to avoid traveling with military convoys.\n \n\n   \n  Government forces have increased patrols and carried out helicopter attacks, claiming to have killed dozens of militants. But the attacks continue, extending fuel shortages to large swathes of central and southern Mali and isolating garrisons of government forces.\n \n\n   \n    How did we get here?\n \n\n   \n  JNIM has long been active in Mali, a French colony until it gained independence in 1960, and other parts of the Sahel, especially in neighboring Burkina Faso. It was formed in 2017 as a coalition of jihadist factions and immediately declared its allegiance to al Qaeda. It has grown in strength in recent years, bringing instability to much of central and western Mali.\n \n\n   \n  This summer it embarked on a campaign of economic warfare in western Mali. It has “attacked factories, industrial facilities, infrastructure projects and artisanal gold mining sites,” according to Garofalo.\n \n\n   \n  “JNIM has demonstrated a new level of coordination, conducting operations hundreds of kilometers apart,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Russian mercenaries have deployed to Mali for counterterrorism missions since 2021, first as part of the Wagner Group and now as what Moscow calls the Africa Corps. But they have been unable to stem the militants’ advance and have suffered extensive casualties.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, JNIM claimed that a “complex ambush” had wiped out a convoy of Russian contractors and Malian soldiers in the north of the country, killing 50 Russians.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian presence appears to have alienated large sections of Mali’s population. A recent Human Rights Watch  report  said the junta and its Russian backers “have committed dozens of summary executions and enforced disappearances of ethnic Fulani men … whom they accuse of collaborating with the JNIM.”\n \n\n   \n    What are the implications for the wider region?\n \n\n   \n  Mali and its neighbors – especially Burkina Faso and Niger – have all seen chronic volatility in recent years. JNIM and other militant groups are active in all three countries. In July alone, JNIM claimed 54 attacks in Burkina Faso, 36 in Mali and seven in Niger.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, JNIM claimed its first attack in northern Nigeria, which is also wracked by militant violence.\n \n\n   \n  Many analysts believe that another coup in Mali, or the collapse of the current regime led by Assimi Goïta, would further destabilize the Sahel, allowing militant groups to expand operations.\n \n\n   \n  JNIM has “increasingly integrated into the region’s illicit economies by exploiting fuel and arms smuggling routes in the tri-border area between Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Ghana,” according to the CEP.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a conflict amid the fluid borders between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso and there is also a risk of contagion to other states – northwest Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire for example,” said Edmund Fitton-Brown, a former coordinator of the UN Sanctions Monitoring Team and now a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, based in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  But Burkina Faso is most at risk, with a fragile military regime that has no writ beyond the capital. “The contagion spreading to Burkina Faso is all but a certainty,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    What might happen next?\n \n\n   \n  There is no sign of the militants preparing for a frontal attack on Bamako. Their strategy seems to be to strangle the capital and provoke unrest against the military junta.\n \n\n   \n  While the Malian army moves slowly and predictably, JNIM militants blend into local communities and get to know their surroundings.\n \n\n   \n  “JNIM has become very adept at conveying the discontent and demands of the poorer sections of the population and ethnic minorities,” said Garofalo, who believes its objective seems to be more about presenting itself as a better government.\n \n\n   \n  It now has the capacity “to create prolonged crises, disrupt supplies, target secondary centrers and influence public opinion, thereby putting serious pressure on an already politically fragile junta,” Garofalo added.\n \n\n   \n  “However, turning this pressure into the fall or replacement of the regime would require seriously escalating operations that have so far been sporadic. JNIM is focusing on systemic weakening and the junta’s loss of local control.”\n \n\n   \n  So far it has been succeeding. While JNIM’s ultimate intentions remain unclear, “Mali could become the first country ruled by (al Qaeda) in its four-decade history,” according to the CEP.\n \n\n   \n  Fitton-Brown said the junta in Bamako won’t get any support from outside. They “essentially evicted the French and fell out with both the UN and the regional force ECOWAS. The Russians were never going to be an alternative.”\n \n\n   \n  “JNIM will eventually insist on a government more to their liking in Bamako, even if they don’t take control themselves and accept something softer than an al Qaeda affiliated regime,” Fitton Brown added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/ice-protest-arrests-illinois","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Protesters Arrested at ICE Facility in Chicago Amid Escalating Tensions Over Immigration Enforcement","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Protests outside the Broadview ICE facility in Chicago have intensified since September, driven by opposition to President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement policies.

ICE protest outside of Chicago. Here’s what happened to them next \n       \n  By Nicquel Terry Ellis, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As demonstrations outside an immigration enforcement facility near Chicago have ramped up over the past couple of months, so has the number of protesters being led away in restraints and facing a court date.\n \n\n   \n  Since September, protesters have rallied weekly outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview against President Donald Trump’s  intensified immigration enforcement campaign  in Chicago. Early on, federal agents guarding the building  deployed tear gas and shot pepper balls in clashes with protesters  and arrested some of them, including some  charged with felonies  on suspicion of assaulting or  blocking  officers.\n \n\n   \n  But by early October, state, county and local law enforcement officers  took a larger role  in policing the protests at the facility. These agencies have made 68 arrests in connection with Broadview protests since October 3, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said on October 28.\n \n\n   \n  The arrests sometimes expose a tension between demonstrators’ desire to exercise their constitutional free speech rights and the intention of authorities – who say some protesters have resisted their attempts to keep paths to the building clear – to let ICE agents and others travel safely to and from the facility.\n \n\n   \n  CNN talked to some arrested demonstrators or, in one case, a protester’s representative, to ask about their experiences in getting arrested on accusations ranging from petty to felony offenses. Here are their stories.\n \n\n   \n    Chicago woman held for hours after a crowd scuffle with police\n \n\n   \n  A’Keisha Lee was standing and chanting with a crowd of protesters near the Broadview ICE facility on October 17 when she saw a swarm of police officers hop out of police vans wearing helmets and carrying batons, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I was sickened,” the 30-year-old Chicago resident recalled. “And I remember feeling really scared.”\n \n\n   \n  The officers walked toward her and the other demonstrators in a “militarized fashion” and began pushing them back, she said. Video of the encounter shows Lee at the front of the crowd when officers with Illinois State Police patches on their sleeves pushed in an apparent attempt to clear them from a paved area, and some demonstrators tried to hold their ground.\n \n\n   \n  Chaos ensued. There was yelling, people falling, and some who appeared to get hurt in the scuffle, Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  She was hit in the face with a baton, and wasn’t sure whether the strike was intentional, she recounted. She’d later discover a bruise on her face.\n \n\n   \n  Lee fell to the ground, and officers helped her up, according to Lee and the video, which was distributed by Reuters. An officer then detained her, putting zip ties around her wrists, she said; that moment is not shown in the Reuters video. Lee couldn’t understand why she was being arrested.\n \n\n   \n  “I was asking them to let me go,” Lee said, “and reinforcing that I hadn’t did anything I wasn’t allowed to do.”\n \n\n   \n  She was escorted to a curb to sit, and moments later placed in a police vehicle that took her to the Broadview Police Department. Lee’s mind raced as she rode in the police car. She worried about going to jail and whether the conditions would be clean and safe. She also worried about whether she’d be treated differently as a Black woman in the legal system.\n \n\n   \n  At the police station, she was booked, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a holding cell with other female protesters for about five hours before being released.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police had arrested her on two Class A misdemeanor counts of resisting a police officer – punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500 – Cook County court records show. She also was cited on suspicion of disobeying a police officer, a petty offense that carries a fine. Her court appearance is scheduled for November 25.\n \n\n   \n  The court documents do not offer details about what led to the arrest, but Lee denies resisting and says it was never made clear to her how she was disobeying police.\n \n\n   \n  “From my understanding, it was in my rights to be there,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police did not directly answer CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including Lee’s assertion that she did nothing wrong or why officers pushed back this crowd. However, they did issue a statement generally addressing the approach of the state, county and local officers who’ve been policing the protests since early October – a group they call the “Unified Command.”\n \n\n   \n  These officers in Broadview “give loud, clear, consistent, and repeated directions and commands to crowds and provide individuals numerous opportunities to comply with the law,” state police said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to note that since the establishment of the Unified Command, there have been no violent confrontations between ICE and protesters in Broadview involving the use of chemical agents, which is a significant departure from operations prior to their presence,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  Lee has protested at the Broadview ICE facility on several recent Fridays, taking issue with how ICE is picking up allegedly undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, and how federal agents are  deploying tear gas  during protests in neighborhoods.\n \n\n   \n  “I think how this country has treated immigrants is one of our original transgressions,” Lee said. “And this is the first tester for what we will allow as a people.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee, who works for a local nonprofit, worries about the fate of her court case; however, she stands by her decision to protest.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s always a fear of being treated like an example when these things happen,” Lee said. “But I do believe that I did not break the law.”\n \n\n   \n    He was arrested while trying to enter the ICE facility\n \n\n   \n  Sean Mills says he is not happy about how immigrants have been treated since the Trump administration started aggressively cracking down on illegal immigration earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  To voice his frustrations, Mills, 37, of Chicago, has become a weekly demonstrator at the Broadview ICE facility. He shows up every Friday and Saturday – sometimes wearing an American flag draped around his shoulders – and joins other protesters outside the facility.   \n \n\n   \n  But on October 17, Mills was arrested for the first time in his life, he said, after he tried to enter the building. Mills had become increasingly concerned with  claims by local activists  that the facility’s conditions were inhumane. So, Mills wanted to view the building’s interior himself.\n \n\n   \n  “I just had the urge to walk over and test my luck,” Mills said. “I walked over to see if I could investigate as a citizen and enter the facility to ask questions and document.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers surrounded Mills near the facility’s entrance, and one told him he was not allowed inside, Mills said. That same officer told Mills to “go back immediately” or be arrested, according to Mills.   \n \n\n   \n  “I tried to explain myself a little bit further,” Mills said, adding he told the officers he was a concerned citizen who wanted to go inside. “And I think about five or 10 seconds later, he (the officer) said ‘OK, you’re under arrest.’”\n \n\n   \n  Mills was shocked because he didn’t believe he had done anything wrong. He also felt the officers had not given him enough time to explain himself before restraining his hands with what he believes were zip ties.\n \n\n   \n  Three other protesters who also were trying to enter the building were arrested, he recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s just an over-policing example, because I walked up there with my hands out to my side, declared myself very openly, and said I’d like to enter the facility,” Mills said. “One hundred percent it was just to show an example of us.”\n \n\n   \n  Mills was escorted to a nearby curb, where he waited roughly 10 minutes for a police van that took him to the Broadview police station, where he was processed and given a citation, he recounted.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police cited him on suspicion of disobeying a police officer – a petty offense punishable by a fine – Cook County court records show, and is scheduled to appear in court November 25.\n \n\n   \n  The court documents do not offer a narrative of the arrest. State police did not directly respond to CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including about Mills’ claim that he did nothing wrong. Instead, they provided the same general statement they gave for Lee’s arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Mills has no regrets protesting and getting arrested because he’s standing up for his beliefs.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a shame that us peaceful protesters are being targeted instead of being encouraged to exercise our First Amendment rights,” Mills said.\n \n\n   \n  Mills objects to law enforcement officers being able to stop and ask people about their immigration status based at least in part on their  apparent ethnicity . A US Supreme Court ruling in a California case last month  appeared to clear the way  for a person’s ethnicity to be a  factor  behind immigration stops by law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Mills also does not support ICE’s roundups throughout Chicago of people accused of being in the country illegally.\n \n\n   \n  “We are doing the least that we can do to keep our neighbors safe, which is so important to us right now,” Mills said.\n \n\n   \n    School cafeteria worker tackled after threatening agents, authorities say\n \n\n   \n  Paul Ivery is a Chicago-area man with an intellectual disability who works at a high school cafeteria and admires and respects the police and first responders in his community – even saluting officers when he passes them – people who know him say.\n \n\n   \n  So it may have surprised acquaintances that for two weeks, he faced a felony charge of assaulting a federal officer at a protest at the ICE facility in Broadview.\n \n\n   \n  The case would draw numerous supporters, including his own mayor, to one of Ivery’s court hearings in an attempt to persuade a judge he wasn’t a threat. Ivery declined to be interviewed for this story, but a family representative, court filings and bystander video help chronicle a case that the government wanted prosecuted one moment but dismissed the next.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery walked from his home in Oak Park to the Broadview ICE facility on September 27 to join the demonstrations, family spokesperson Scott Sakiwama said.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery would later tell investigators he was there to “protest against ICE” because he believed that “ICE agents were disrespectful towards the Broadview Police Department and veterans,”  a criminal complaint filed against Ivery in federal court said,  without elaborating on his motivation.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was also upset that federal agents had been  deploying tear gas and shooting pepper balls at protesters  at Broadview, according to Sakiwama.\n \n\n   \n  At some point during the protest, Ivery approached a US Border Patrol agent and shouted something at him, according to the  complaint . While the agent couldn’t recall what was said, Ivery would admit to investigators later that he said, “I’ll (expletive) kill you right now,” and, “do something,” according to the document.\n \n\n   \n  After the shout, Ivery ran and jumped on top of an occupied vehicle as agents chased him, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Video from a bystander shows Ivery jumping off the vehicle, and an agent tackling him as he hits the pavement. Ivery yells as several agents restrain him. Nearby, other agents fire chemical irritants into the ground to keep bystanders away, appearing to cause some people to cough, the video shows . \n \n\n   \n  An onlooker asks Ivery for his name. Ivery yells it and says, “Help me!” Minutes later, after agents tied his hands behind his back and sat him up, an agent helps Ivery drink from a water bottle. Ivery is eventually pulled to his feet and led into the back of an unmarked vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  The complaint alleges that as agents were restraining Ivery, he grabbed an agent’s helmet and pulled it down, hurting the agent’s chin and exposing the agent to pepper spray.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was arrested and  charged  in federal court with felony assault on a federal officer, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was temporarily held at the Broadview ICE facility on the day of his arrest and transferred to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago that evening, Sakiwama said.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was held for several days. But by October 1, prosecutors asked to have him released from jail and put on house arrest pending trial, acknowledging his disability,  CNN affiliate WLS-TV reported .\n \n\n   \n  At a hearing that day, a judge released Ivery on his own recognizance. Many of Ivery’s supporters, including Oak Park Mayor Vicki Scaman, were there to back him,  according to WLS .\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to the judge, Scaman said Ivery is a “valued member of our community” who stops and salutes police when he sees them on the street. She wrote that Ivery is not a threat to the community, and she hoped the judge would consider Ivery’s “special needs diagnosis.”\n \n\n   \n  On October 9, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charge altogether, and the judge ordered the dismissal the next day. The court records did not say why the case was dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  The US attorney’s office for Illinois’ northern district did not respond to CNN’s request for information about the dismissal. Ivery’s court-appointed attorney declined to be interviewed about the specifics of the case.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy for Mr. Ivery and the just resolution of his case and hope that others who are also having their First Amendment rights trampled by the government receive justice as well,” Ivery’s attorney and federal public defender Johanathan Brooks said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Bill Kirkos and Caroll Alvarado contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/uk/andrew-sandringham-estate-explained-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"09:04:00-05:00","title":"What We Know About Sandringham, Andrew’s New Home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, a former royal, is being formally stripped of his titles and military rank due to allegations of involvement with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as detailed in Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.

      \n  By Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:04 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The rapid fall from grace of the now  former Prince Andrew , culminating in his humiliating exile by  King Charles III  to the Sandringham estate, has been no less than stunning.\n \n\n   \n  His titles and honors are in the process of being formally stripped – he will henceforth be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – and he’s been served notice to surrender his 75-year lease of  Royal Lodge , the huge mansion he has lived in for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  It is not yet known exactly when Andrew will leave Windsor, west of the British capital London, for the monarch’s retreat in rural Norfolk.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the sprawling estate that Andrew will soon call home.\n \n\n   \n    The late Queen’s favorite retreat\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has agreed to move out of the 30-room royal residence he has shared with his ex-wife  Sarah Ferguson  within the grounds of Windsor Great Park and into a new home in Sandringham. The estate was beloved by the late Queen Elizabeth II and is now said to be a favorite escape for Andrew’s elder brother King Charles and Queen Camilla.\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace is keen for Andrew to move to the country estate, roughly 100 miles north of London, as soon as is practical. But it will not happen immediately, a royal source told CNN on Friday. That’s because giving notice, surrendering the lease and other formalities related to the relocation - which is similar to buying a house - could make it a protracted process.\n \n\n   \n   Sandringham  was purchased in 1862 by Queen Victoria for her eldest son and heir Albert, later Edward VII, who had just turned 21. It has been the private home of five generations of British monarchs and is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas each year.\n \n\n   \n    Christmas family tradition\n \n\n   \n  Sandringham is perhaps the most famous stately home in Norfolk, on England’s east coast. The massive estate is spread across an estimated 20,000 acres, with 600 acres of royal parkland and some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  Since its purchase, each monarch has helped develop it over the years. The main house was completed in 1870, with a ballroom added 13 years later. Guest and staff accommodation came in the 1890s. It underwent a major overhaul in 1975 when more than 100 rooms in the service wing were demolished “to remove dry rot, save on heating costs and move the kitchens closer to the Dining Room,” according to the Sandringham website.\n \n\n   \n  The house was also the location for Queen Elizabeth II’s first televised Christmas broadcast in 1957.\n \n\n   \n  Within the grounds sits St. Mary Magdalene Church which is routinely used as a place of worship by the Windsors when in residence. It has become a tradition to see the family walk to it every Christmas morning, greeting well-wishers along the way.\n \n\n   \n  The estate also includes an organic farm, sawmill, residential and commercial properties, local parishes and communities.\n \n\n   \n  King George V described Sandringham as “the place I love better than anywhere else in the world” while his son and Queen Elizabeth II’s father George VI once wrote, “I have always been happy here and I love the place.”\n \n\n   \n  The property’s gardens were the first part of the estate to be opened to the public in 1908 by Edward VII. Elizabeth II later opened the main house to the public in 1977 to coincide with her silver jubilee year.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband Philip took responsibility for the estate’s management when Elizabeth acceeded to the throne in 1952. Conservation was at the heart of his approach to ensure that it was maintained for future generations.\n \n\n   \n    So where might Andrew live?\n \n\n   \n  No family members live at Sandringham House permanently these days, but King Charles frequently visits the grand property. Within its vast grounds there are several properties where the monarch could house his brother.\n \n\n   \n   York Cottage , previously known as Bachelor’s Cottage, was given to then-Duke and Duchess of York – the future George V and Queen Mary – as a wedding gift in 1893 by Edward VII. In recent years it has been used as accommodation for vacationers as well as estate staff and has also been used as the estate office for Sandringham, according to the Times of London. It was also reportedly considered for Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex before they stepped back as working royals.\n \n\n   \n   Gardens House  is another viable option. It was previously the home of the estate’s head gardener. The four-bed, three-bath property is currently being used as a holiday let. “This light and airy red brick Edwardian property accommodates up to eight guests, with each room thoughtfully furnished with a blend of rustic pieces, modern comforts, and botanical prints,” the Sandringham website reads.\n \n\n   \n   The Folly  is another available property on the estate. It too is being offered to travelers looking for the chance to “experience the serene splendour” of Sandringham. The original structure dates back to the 1800s and over the years has served as a hunting lodge and a space for ladies to enjoy afternoon tea. It can sleep six guests in its three bedrooms and features a wraparound balcony with a staircase that leads to a turret which “offers panoramic views across the estate,” according to its listing.\n \n\n   \n   Park House  is an additional property on the estate, but it would require some work. It was where Diana, the former Princess of Wales was born and spent much of her childhood. In the early 80s it was offered to charity Leonard Cheshire, which transformed it into a hotel for disabled people. There were plans for it to be renovated in 2019 which were put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n \n\n   \n   Wood Farm  is a farmhouse on the estate that has strong ties to Andrew’s parents. It is also where his father, Prince Philip, based himself after retiring from public duties in 2017 at the age of 95. However, it is not thought to be where Andrew will end up.\n \n\n   \n  Another option, though it seems incredibly unlikely, is  Anmer Hall,  which was gifted to Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales by the late Queen when they wed in 2013. The couple, along with their three children, do not live there permanently but are still thought to spend time during school breaks at the 10-bedroom Georgian property.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the move happening now?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is losing his royal titles and styles, as well as his Windsor home after weeks of snowballing scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Public fury was compounded after the publication of a  posthumous memoir from Virginia Giuffre  in October, in which she repeated her claims that she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions as a teenager while being trafficked by Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has always denied the claims made against him. But it is understood that the King took action after the recent developments sparked renewed outrage and threatened to taint the monarchy’s reputation further.\n \n\n   \n  His decision to essentially banish his disgraced brother to Sandringham came after consulting legal and constitutional experts, as well as his wider family and the government.\n \n\n   \n  Downing Street said Friday that it backed the King’s actions to remove Andrew’s titles and honors. “Our hearts go out to the family of Virginia Giuffre and all the victims who suffered from Jeffrey Epstein’s despicable crimes in all of this. We should never forget that,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew will also lose his last remaining military rank as vice admiral of the Royal Navy at the request of King Charles III, British defense minister John Healey told the BBC on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    And who will pay for relocation?\n \n\n   \n  Sandringham House and its extensive surrounding estate have been handed down through the generations and is privately owned by the sovereign.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, Andrew’s current home in Windsor is part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state.\n \n\n   \n  It is understood that the disgraced royal will move to an undisclosed property, with the relocation privately financed by Charles, who will also make financial provisions for his sibling.\n \n\n   \n  His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is also moving from Royal Lodge but she will make her own living arrangements and is not expected to join Andrew at Sandringham.\n \n\n   \n  The two Pembroke Welsh corgis,  Muick and Sandy, that once belonged to Queen Elizabeth II  will remain in the care of Andrew’s family, Buckingham Palace confirmed to Britain’s PA Media news agency on Friday. However, the palace did not specify if the dogs would stay with Ferguson, head to Norfolk with Andrew or be passed on to their daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/sport/new-york-city-marathon-obiri-kipruto","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00-05:00","title":"Obiri sets women’s NYC Marathon course record, Kipruto wins men’s race in photo finish","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hellen Obiri of Kenya set a new women’s course record in the 2025 New York City Marathon, finishing in 2:19:51 and breaking the previous record of 2:22:31 set in 2003.

in central England that Prime Minister Keir Starmer described as “deeply concerning.”\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested after the attack, which British Transport Police (BTP) declared “a major incident,” adding that counterterrorism officers were supporting the investigation. BTP also declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before later rescinding this.\n \n\n   \n  Police said 10 people were taken to hospital, nine of whom suffered life-threatening injuries. No fatalities have been reported from the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Officers were called at at 7.42 p.m. to a report of the attack on the service from the northern city of Doncaster to London’s King’s Cross. Armed officers were deployed to Huntingdon station, where the train made an unplanned stop and the two people were arrested, police said.\n \n\n   \n  More than 12 hours after the incident, police had yet to reveal details about the suspected attackers.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Defence Minister John Healey told Sky News on Sunday that the incident appeared to be an “isolated attack.”\n \n\n   \n    Passenger saw suspect tasered\n \n\n   \n  Wren Chambers, who was on the train when the attack happened, told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down.\n \n\n   \n  “A minute or so later a man… was running down with a very clear wound, bleeding quite badly on his arm. And I thought it was like some sort of Halloween prank at first. But then he’s shouting that someone’s got a knife, he was stabbed,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  After seeing more people running down the train, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get far down the train as they can.”\n \n\n   \n  Another witness who was traveling on the train said he saw an “extremely bloodied” victim. The man, who gave his name as Gavin, told Sky News he believed he saw a suspect tasered before he was arrested.\n \n\n   \n  He said police shouted “Get down, get down” as they got closer to him.\n \n\n   \n  “He then was waving a knife, quite a large knife, and then they detained him,” the eyewitness said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Another male passenger, Olly Foster, told the Daily Mail he’d been listening to an audiobook when the attack happened. “A young girl was distraught as the attacker tried to stab her, but a hero of an older man got in the way taking a gash on his forehead and I think another on his neck,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Video shared on social media of the immediate aftermath of the incident showed a bloodied person rushing out of Huntingdon station and dozens of police and emergency vehicles with flashing blue lights gathered outside. In one video armed officers were seen sprinting down a platform at the station toward the front end of a stationary train.\n \n\n   \n  British Transport Police Chief Superintendent Chris Casey called it “a shocking incident” and said his thoughts were with those injured and their families.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re conducting urgent enquiries to establish what has happened, and it could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything further,” he said. “At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident.”\n \n\n   \n    Large-scale response\n \n\n   \n  Emergency first responders said they had mobilized a large-scale response to the stabbing attack, including sending several air ambulances.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement on X, the East of England Ambulance Service said it had sent “numerous ambulances, tactical commanders, our Hazardous Area Response Team, and critical care teams,” from several regional jurisdictions.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer said on social media: “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” he said on X.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”   \n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said she is receiving regular updates on the investigation and urged people to avoid “speculation at this early stage” as to what was behind the stabbings.\n \n\n   \n  The rail company that operates trains on the East Coast Main Line, London North Eastern Railway (LNER), said that it was “experiencing major disruption across the LNER route.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.\n \n\n   \n  “Our advice is ‘Do Not Travel’. Please defer your travel where you can,” LNER said.\n \n\n   \n  It remains unclear at this stage what crimes the attackers will be charged with. Homicide rates in the UK are low compared to other Western nations. Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics. In comparison knife crime has risen overall since 2011, although a 1% decrease was recorded over the past year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/democrats-shutdown-politics","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"Democrats Are Winning the Shutdown Politics.

Can they stop now? \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After the 2013 government shutdown ended, Republican leaders made clear they had only been humoring Sen. Ted Cruz and his plot to defund Obamacare.\n \n\n   \n  “It was not a smart play. It had no chance of success,” then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  said .\n \n\n   \n  Then-House Speaker John Boehner initially said the GOP had “fought the good fight.” But he would later say the plan “ never had a chance ” and even called the Texas senator “ Lucifer in the flesh .”\n \n\n   \n  This is how shutdowns generally go. The side seeking a concession fights what they view as “the good fight,” and then they give up when it becomes clear that it’s also a losing fight. Because, as McConnell has often said, shutdowns don’t work.\n \n\n   \n  And maybe that’s how Democrats thought this one would go down. House Speaker Mike Johnson basically predicted as much Saturday, wagering Democrats might  back down after Tuesday’s elections .\n \n\n   \n  But a full month into the shutdown, it’s hard to see how Democrats can give up now. The politics of this have gone surprisingly well for them. And Republicans seem to be the ones struggling for a path forward.\n \n\n   \n  Much can change as some of the biggest impacts of the shutdown  start to hit this weekend  and in the coming weeks. But we’re in a very different kind of shutdown this time — one where it’s much tougher to see the politics forming an obvious off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The polling on blame has been remarkably constant since before the shutdown began. People continue to blame President Donald Trump and the Republicans more than Democrats by double-digit margins in most surveys. That margin was  45%-33%  in a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A  Yahoo News-YouGov poll , meanwhile, showed 46% said they blamed “conservative Republicans” a lot for the shutdown — more than the 38% who blamed “progressive Democrats” that much.\n \n\n   \n  Surveys also continue to show that Democrats’ policy demand, an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies, remains popular with more than 7 in 10 Americans.\n \n\n   \n  That Yahoo survey also suggested a problem for Republicans that we haven’t seen tested in previous polling.\n \n\n   \n  It showed Americans said by a nearly 3-to-1 margin — 63%-21% — that they disapproved of the firings of thousands of federal workers during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  This was, of course, Trump’s big threat to Democrats. He made a big show of casting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as the grim reaper ready to target Democratic employees and programs for cuts — even as some Republicans  cautioned the White House  that such cuts could squander the GOP’s political advantages. Then the administration  followed through .\n \n\n   \n  But it  doesn’t seem to have dissuaded Democrats from pressing forward. And there’s now reason to believe those Republicans had a point about these cuts backfiring on the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, much of the GOP’s handling of this seems rather haphazard. And Friday was a case in point.\n \n\n   \n  The day started with Republicans dealing with a curveball from Trump, who decided late Thursday to suddenly urge them to nuke the filibuster to end the shutdown. This completely impractical idea also  legitimized a key Democratic talking point  — that Republicans could end the shutdown any time they want.\n \n\n   \n  Then Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made a few seemingly unhelpful comments about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, also known as food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  She at one point said that if people really needed them that badly, then “ we have failed you .” House Speaker Mike Johnson soon stepped in to clarify that the “we” somehow meant, “we, the Democrats.” (Neither Rollins nor Johnson is, in fact, a Democrat.)\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Rollins was noncommittal when asked whether the administration would abide by a judge’s order for it to release emergency SNAP funds, saying, “We’re looking at all the options.”\n \n\n   \n  It was a stunning response — not just because ignoring court orders could trigger a constitutional crisis, but also because it would mean the administration would be taking such a drastic step to prevent poor people from getting food.\n \n\n   \n  A  pair of federal judges  soon ordered the administration to release the emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits. But ahead of the rulings, Republicans did a great job making themselves out to be opposed to this — and even ready to fight against it. (Trump on Friday night ultimately indicated he  would do what he could to fund SNAP .)\n \n\n   \n  Another major factor here is what the shutdown could do for Democrats. It’s early, but there is evidence this has led to something of a badly needed rallying effect on the left.\n \n\n   \n  The reason the Democratic Party has seen some of its worst poll numbers in history this year is largely because Democrats themselves have lost faith in their party. But a  Quinnipiac University poll  last week showed 58% of Democratic voters suddenly approved of their party’s congressional contingent.\n \n\n   \n  That’s still not great. But it is up nearly 20 points from where it was between February and July, when that number hovered around 40%.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats would seem to have relatively little reason to back down — and plenty of reason to stick with their demands that Republicans come to the table on extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. Imagine a situation in which they have these seeming political advantages and they throw in the towel anyways. It’s not difficult to see that reigniting a backlash on the left.\n \n\n   \n  And in case that danger wasn’t clear, witness a newly released Pew Research Center poll. It asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who expressed frustration with the party what the main reason for that was. Far and away, the most-cited reason was not fighting hard enough against the Trump administration,  which 41% cited .\n \n\n   \n  If you’re a Democrat, it’s hard to look at all of that and not want to at least let things play out. You might think the  premium increases  that people are seeing on their Obamacare plans after open enrollment began Saturday could shift the politics even more in your favor. And maybe you’ve got a little more confidence in how the SNAP issue is going to play.\n \n\n   \n  You might even start to think that, at the end of this long journey, there could be something more valuable than a moral victory.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/rama-duwaji-mamdani-wife-nyc-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"Rama Duwaji, Zohran Mamdani’s wife, stays in the background by design","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rama Duwaji, the wife of New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, has intentionally remained low-profile during the campaign, avoiding traditional first lady roles such as media appearances or political endorsements.

November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rama Duwaji isn’t playing the traditional role of a first lady in waiting.\n \n\n   \n  She hasn’t stumped for  Zohran Mamdani , the New York City Democratic mayoral nominee and front-runner she married earlier this year. She hasn’t done a joint television appearance or agreed to a splashy magazine profile.\n \n\n   \n  And hardly anything on her Instagram page, where she promotes her artwork depicting Middle Eastern women and the plight of Palestinians, suggests that she even knows Mamdani, aside from one post on the day of the June Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  “Couldn’t possibly be prouder,”  she wrote  in the caption of a carousel of photos showing the couple together, a photo of herself voting early and a photo of Mamdani as a boy.\n \n\n   \n  If Mamdani wins Tuesday’s election, becoming the city’s first Muslim mayor and its youngest in a century, Duwaji too would be positioned to make and shape history. She would be the first member of Gen Z to serve as New York City’s first lady, a 28-year-old artist moving into Gracie Mansion under the relentless spotlight of America’s largest city.\n \n\n   \n  While she’s skipped traditional campaign set pieces, Duwaji has been present during key moments and has advised behind the scenes on social media and campaign iconography. She tagged along as Mamdani cast his primary vote early in the day, when many observers still thought he was  unlikely to beat former Gov. Andrew Cuomo , and joined Mamdani onstage when  he delivered his victory speech  that night.\n \n\n   \n  She accompanied Mamdani to his most recent appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.” And she was in the crowd, sitting alongside more than 10,000 people at a packed Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, to watch Mamdani make  his closing argument at a rally  headlined by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n \n\n   \n  It isn’t clear what, if any, official role Duwaji would have if Mamdani is elected mayor. She has declined interviews during the general election campaign, including a request from CNN for this story.\n \n\n   \n  But the last several months offer some clues.\n \n\n   \n    An awareness of what she was getting into\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji, who is of Syrian descent, was born in Houston and lived in Texas until her family moved to Dubai when she was 9. She briefly attended the Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar before transferring to the school’s Richmond campus to complete her degree. She later earned a master’s degree in illustration as visual essay from the School of Visual Arts in New York.\n \n\n   \n  Her illustrations have appeared in The Cut, the BBC, Vogue and The New Yorker.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji and Mamdani met on the dating app Hinge in 2021. Mamdani had recently been elected to the New York State Assembly, something Duwaji knew little about.\n \n\n   \n  Their first date would sound familiar to many of the young supporters of Mamdani’s campaign: They shared a meal at Qahwah House, a Yemeni coffee shop in Brooklyn, followed by a stroll in nearby McCarren Park. On their second date, Mamdani took Duwaji on a tour of his legislative district in Astoria, Queens.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Duwaji were engaged a few years later, in October 2024. Days after announcing their engagement on Instagram, Mamdani launched his campaign for mayor. They celebrated their engagement in Dubai that December, followed by a courthouse wedding this February at the city clerk’s office in Lower Manhattan. They posed for photos on the green couches of the marriage bureau’s waiting room, in front of a backdrop showing City Hall.\n \n\n   \n  Several months before the ceremony, Mamdani and Duwaji discussed how his plans to run for mayor could potentially change their lives, limit their privacy and likely thrust Duwaji into the public eye, according to a person familiar with the couple granted anonymity to share private details.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Mamdani launched his mayoral bid and questions began to swirl about the couple — “Socialist NYC mayoral contender Zohran Mamdani secretly tied the knot in exotic Dubai ceremony, photos show,” read a  New York Post headline  — he released their civil ceremony images on Instagram.\n \n\n   \n  “Rama isn’t just my wife, she’s an incredible artist who deserves to be known on her own terms,” Mamdani wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji, the person familiar with the couple said, knew what she was getting into. In the year that Mamdani has campaigned for mayor, she has been a major source of support, even if he falls asleep on the couch as they try to get through “Temptation Island” and the “Mission Impossible” series in 15- to 30-minute increments.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji helped finalize the campaign’s brand identity and worked on the final version of the campaign’s iconography and font, which showcases a distinct blend of colors easily identifiable to New Yorkers: Metrocard orange-yellow, New York Mets blue for shadow drops and backgrounds, and splashes of firehouse red. The font calls back to a time of bold-yellow bodega signs calling out to customers.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, whose mayoral bid has been powered by his use of social media, also credits Duwaji with improving the campaign’s digital sensibilities.\n \n\n   \n  He has sometimes been peppered with questions about his young marriage and the couple’s future. At a recent press conference where Mamdani was highlighting his proposal to provide newborn New Yorkers and their families with “baby baskets,” he was asked whether he planned on having any children soon.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like I’m talking to my mother,” the 34-year-old responded with a laugh, adding that for now, he is focused on the mayoral race.\n \n\n   \n    A focus on the Palestinian cause\n \n\n   \n  Traditionally, first spouses thrust into high-profile support roles host events, back causes that complement their partner’s agenda, and keep their more controversial opinions to themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji’s political views speak loudly through her art, which features black-and-white illustrations depicting Middle Eastern women, severe hunger in Gaza and the Palestinian flag. Those posts broadly align with her husband’s  criticisms of the Israeli government  and its conduct of the war following Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks, comments that have at times  roiled New York City’s Jewish population , the largest outside Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “What she is posting has been in line with many of the things that Mamdani has talked about,” said Lisa Burns, a professor of media studies at Quinnipiac University who has studied the role of first ladies. “I’m starting to see some of that work merging, where the advocacy work that she is doing will support the work he is doing — even if it’s separate — as opposed to detracting from it.”\n \n\n   \n  In an April  interview  with Yung, a quarterly magazine focused on art from Africa and the Middle East, Duwaji said she creates her work “for people who care about the things I care about.”\n \n\n   \n  “With so many people being pushed out and silenced by fear, all I can do is use my voice to speak out about what’s happening in the US and Palestine and Syria as much as I can,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    A role to be defined\n \n\n   \n  New York City is no stranger to mayoral spouses with their own public profiles.\n \n\n   \n  Mayor Bill de Blasio’s then-wife, Chirlane McCray, was a staple of his campaign and administration, providing input on staff picks and high-profile appointments. Part of de Blasio’s  appeal to voters  was how his multiracial family had helped shape his worldview.\n \n\n   \n  A 2013  New York Times profile  of McCray described her and de Blasio as being “as much a package deal as Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton.” Political meetings were set around her schedule, and McCray sat in on key job interviews. She was assigned oversight of a mental health initiative that brought her in front of the City Council during budget negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Diana Taylor, the longtime partner of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, was a former government official and finance executive who didn’t define herself by the role.\n \n\n   \n  “Her famous boyfriend may be the least interesting thing about her,” then-Vogue editor Anna Wintour, a friend of Taylor’s, told  The Washington Post  in 2020 when Bloomberg was running for president. “She’s intelligent, independent — and completely her own person.”\n \n\n   \n  For now, Duwaji’s presence can’t be seen by most New Yorkers, even if it is felt quietly by her husband’s campaign.\n \n\n   \n  At a recent “sip and pour” event at a senior citizen center in Brooklyn intended to get out the vote, Mamdani tried to follow along as an art instructor showed the group how to draw a fall landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Brush in hand and a paper plate with dots of paint as a palette, Mamdani tried to tamp down expectations.\n \n\n   \n  “I have to warn you all, I’m not very good at painting,” he said, adding the last time he had painted anything was on a date with his wife. Mamdani then began to draw. Asked later about the quality of his sketch, he said, “Don’t tell my wife.”\n \n\n   \n  A campaign aide had already done so, texting a photo of his attempt to draw a tree.\n \n\n   \n  She fired back: “That is a triangle.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/zohran-mamdani-jewish-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"11:30:00-05:00","title":"'I hate my choices': How Zohran Mamdani’s run for mayor has split Jews in New York","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani’s run for mayor of New York has ignited a deep and generational split among Jewish voters, with younger, progressive Jews supporting his pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel positions, while older, more traditional Jews see them as dangerous or antisemitic.

November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As a Jew and a New Yorker, Norman Needleman said he finds the city’s mayoral election “painful.”\n \n\n   \n  Waiting in line Friday to vote on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, the 77-year-old Needleman thought Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist, would be good for the city’s social needs. But his positions on Israel were just too much for Needleman to accept.\n \n\n   \n  “If I try and bend that far, I’ll break,” he said, quoting the musical “Fiddler on the Roof.”\n \n\n   \n  His comments reflect what has been a fraught debate, among Jews in New York and elsewhere, ahead of the city’s mayoral election Tuesday. Jewish voters have long reliably  supported Democrats , and Mamdani won the Democratic primary, but concerns about rising antisemitism and Mamdani’s sharp criticisms of Israel have opened up a generational split and raised deeper questions what it means to be an American Jew in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  This election has shown clearly that “Jews and Jewish voters are not a monolith,” said Phylisa Wisdom, the director of the New York Jewish Agenda, an advocacy group promoting liberal Jewish New Yorkers.\n \n\n   \n  “Folks have been really trying to reckon with how much does it matter that they have a mayor that has their same feelings about Israel,” she said. “There are some who feel like it’s not the most important thing to me when I’m voting for mayor, how they feel about Israel, and there are some who think it’s existential, and they couldn’t vote for someone who disagrees with them on Israel or doesn’t support Israel as a Jewish state.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue stems from Mamdani’s history of pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel activism, from his college days when he started a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, to his support for the  Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement  against Israel, to his pledge to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  In more recent months, Mamdani has tempered some of his most controversial positions and tried to reassure Jewish voters worried about antisemitic attacks like the ones in  Washington, DC , and  Boulder, Colorado . Democratic Jewish politicians like City Comptroller  Brad Lander  and Rep.  Jerry Nadler  have endorsed him, though US Sen. Chuck Schumer remains a notable holdout.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone has been convinced.\n \n\n   \n  “Shabbat Shalom. To be clear, unequivocal, and on the record: I believe Zohran Mamdani poses a danger to the security of the New York Jewish community,”  Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove  of Park Avenue Synagogue told his congregation on October 18.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,100 rabbis and Jewish leaders across the US soon  signed an open letter  agreeing with Cosgrove’s message and calling on Americans to “stand up for candidates who reject antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s rise comes amid a growing split in the American Jewish electorate, particularly along age lines, about Israel in the wake of the war in Gaza the last two years. While 56% of Jewish Americans say they are emotionally attached to Israel, that number falls to 36% among those aged 18 to 34, according to polling from  The Washington Post .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a tense time in the Jewish family group chats,” Ezra Klein wrote in  The New York Times  this summer.\n \n\n   \n  While Mamdani is ahead among likely voters in most public polls, recent polls from  Fox News  and  Marist  both had 55% of Jewish likely voters in the city backing former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running an independent campaign after losing to Mamdani in the June Democratic primary. Mamdani had 32% with Jewish voters in each poll.\n \n\n   \n  For voters like Cosgrove, Mamdani’s position on Israel is a dealbreaker. Others, like those in the progressive activist group  Jewish Voices for Peace , see it as a positive. Still many other Jews see Mamdani’s views on Israel as less important than his other proposed policies: freezing increases on the city’s rent-stabilized apartments, focusing on affordability and standing up to President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Not to mention Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa have their own drawbacks.\n \n\n   \n  “I hate my choices,” said Cydney Schwartz, a 33-year-old liberal Democrat who has lived in Israel.\n \n\n   \n    What Mamdani has said about Israel and Jews\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel advocacy have been a key throughline of his political beliefs.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has declined to say he believes Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state, saying the country should provide equal rights to all residents. He previously refused to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada,” referencing an Arabic term used by Palestinians to describe their uprising against Israel. He has recently said he  would discourage the use  of the phrase.\n \n\n   \n  A day after the  October 7, 2023 , Hamas attacks on Israel, which sparked the devastating war in Gaza,  Mamdani issued  a statement that did not condemn Hamas or the attacks. He has repeatedly criticized Israel’s actions as a “ genocide ” and said he would arrest Netanyahu if he visits New York, citing a warrant from the  International Criminal Court , of which the US is not a member.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, a September 2023 video of him connecting New York Police Department oppression to the Israel Defense Forces spread widely online.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it’s been laced by the IDF,”  he said  then at a Democratic Socialists of America convention.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about that line last week, he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper, “It was a reference to training exercises that have taken place between the NYPD and the IDF.”\n \n\n   \n  “So do you still believe that the NYPD is basically working hand in glove with the IDF?” Cooper asked.\n \n\n   \n  “No. What I’ve made very clear is those are training exercises that are of concern to me,” Mamdani replied. “And what my focus is, is on working with the NYPD to actually deliver public safety for New Yorkers across the five boroughs.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, after his victory in the Democratic primary, he pledged to “understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree and to wrestle deeply with those disagreements.”\n \n\n   \n  During Rosh Hashanah, Mamdani attended services at Kolot Chayeinu, one of Brooklyn’s most progressive synagogues. For Yom Kippur, considered the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, Mamdani attended services at Lab Shul, a non-denominational Jewish congregation, accompanied by Jewish political allies in Nadler and Lander.\n \n\n   \n  He has met with Hasidic leaders, including two prominent rabbis from Williamsburg’s Satmar community, an ultra-Orthodox sect with its own set of demands for city government.\n \n\n   \n  He has promised he would keep in place police protection for the city’s annual parade honoring Israel. And he has said  he would not have an Israel-related  litmus test for working in his administration.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m going to have people in my administration who are Zionists,” he said, according to  The Free Press .\n \n\n   \n    How Jewish New Yorkers feel\n \n\n   \n  “Two Jews, three opinions,” goes the old joke, a play on the religion’s tradition of debate, and that was evident in conversations with liberal Jews voting for mayor Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re figuring it out,” Wisdom said. “There’s a lot of out-loud figuring it out.”\n \n\n   \n  Schwartz, the 33-year-old liberal who has lived in Israel, said she feels a powerful connection to the country. Still, she said, she didn’t agree with Israel’s politics or Netanyahu, similarly to how she disagrees with Trump’s politics in the US.\n \n\n   \n  She considered not voting, but ultimately picked a candidate, who she declined to share. “I want to focus on the city I live in,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  David, a 29-year-old wearing a yarmulke who declined to give his last name, said the vote felt like an “existential” decision. He said he didn’t particularly care about how the mayor feels about Israel, but Mamdani’s focus on Israeli-Palestinian politics made it hard to believe he’s not antisemitic, and he worried whether that could bleed into other policies.\n \n\n   \n  He said he planned to vote for Cuomo “reluctantly.” “He’s bad on everything,” David said of his preferred choice. “He’s a bad person.”\n \n\n   \n  Eric Weltman, a 58-year-old wearing a suit and tie, proudly said he voted for Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s smart, competent, principled and progressive,” he said, adding he had no qualms about Mamdani’s positions on Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s going to be mayor of New York, not ambassador to Israel,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As for Needleman, the 77-year-old who quoted “Fiddler,” he said he couldn’t support Mamdani and felt Cuomo was too dishonest. So he decided to vote for Sliwa even though he disagreed with the Republican’s politics, saying Sliwa seemed like a “decent guy.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/tech/saudi-arabia-ai-powerhouse","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Saudi Arabia is making a massive bet on becoming a global AI powerhouse","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Saudi Arabia is investing heavily in artificial intelligence through its state-owned Humain company, aiming to become the world’s third-largest AI market after the United States and China.

powerhouse \n       \n  By Tala Alrajjal, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Saudi Arabia is turning its oil wealth toward its massive AI ambitions.\n \n\n   \n  Its chief investment vehicle is Humain, a homegrown company that is building out a full stack of data centers, cloud capabilities, large language models and applications. It’s owned by the Kingdom’s nearly $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund.\n \n\n   \n  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman  unveiled Humain in May  ahead of President Donald Trump’s  state visit to Riyadh . This week, at the annual Future Investment Initiative in the same location, the scale, ambition and deep pockets behind the project came into clearer focus.\n \n\n   \n  Humain CEO, Tareq Amin, is setting out to make Saudi Arabia the world’s third-largest AI market, after the United States and China. It’s a bold ambition for a newcomer to the industry, but Amin argues the Kingdom’s competitive edge lies in its abundant and cheap energy resources that can feed the seemingly insatiable demand for computing power.\n \n\n   \n  “We have an advantage in Saudi Arabia,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “Look at this country’s amazing energy grid that doesn’t require a company like Humain to build the substations and the power to deliver that to a data center. That means I have saved 18 months of time.”\n \n\n   \n  Humain plans to build up to six gigawatts in data center capability across the country by 2034, with a rolodex of key AI partners, including Nvidia, AMD, Amazon Web Services, Qualcomm and Cisco.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Humain announced a  $3 billion deal  with private equity giant Blackstone to build data centers in the Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  It also publicly launched  Humain One , an AI-powered operating system where users speak or type to a computer to tell it to perform tasks, rather than clicking on icons, as is conventional in systems like Windows or iOS.\n \n\n   \n  Humain has been using the AI system internally to run much of its HR, finance, legal, operational and IT departments. Amin says there is now only one employee in his payroll department, with AI agents handling the rest.\n \n\n   \n  The Kingdom is entering the closing stretch of its Vision 2030 economic transformation plan facing headwinds from declining oil prices and delays in its construction of giga-projects like Neom, placing new urgency on its AI push to support the growth of the Arab world’s largest economy.\n \n\n   \n  It also  faces competition  from the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which has its own AI vehicle, G42, and recently secured a landmark deal with the Trump administration to build “ Stargate UAE ,” a sprawling $500 billion data center project billed as the largest outside the United States, with the help of OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether there’s room for two regional heavyweights, Amin said he supports democratizing AI, while touting Humain’s robust operations.\n \n\n   \n  “It is good for humanity to have knowledge — especially around AI — not to be all centralized in one location. So it’s good what is happening in the UAE. It’s very good what’s happening in Saudi Arabia,” he said. “I will tell you what we decided to do, which is very different … Humane is not a holding company. We are an operating company.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/americas/mexico-sonora-fire-dozens-killed-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:57:00-04:00","title":"Fire at general store kills at least 23 in northern Mexico, state governor says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fire at a Waldo’s general store in Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora state in northern Mexico, has resulted in at least 23 deaths and 11 injuries, with victims including minors.

“Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said three men, whom he identified as “narco-terrorists,” were killed in the operation, which he said was carried out in international waters. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n  The boat was “carrying narcotics” and “transiting along a known narco-trafficking route,” Hegseth said, citing US intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s attack marks the 15th known US military strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel since the Trump administration began the operations in early September. The strikes, which have been carried out in the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, have killed a total of 64 people.\n \n\n   \n  “These narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home—and they will not succeed. The Department will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda,” Hegseth said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s strike is the first targeting a boat in the Caribbean since October 24. After concentrating on the region initially, the Pentagon in recent weeks deliberately refocused its efforts against suspected drug traffickers to the eastern Pacific,  CNN reported  Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The shift was made because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, according to people familiar with the matter. Six known strikes have been carried out in the Pacific over the last two weeks, including three conducted in a single day last week.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in Congress and international leaders have questioned the legality of the Trump administration’s accelerating strikes.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the strikes  violate international law  and called for them to stop.\n \n\n   \n  “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats,” human rights commissioner Volker Türk said, according to a statement released by his office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers,  CNN previously reported . The opinion argues that the president is allowed to authorize deadly force against a broad range of cartels because they pose an imminent threat to Americans.\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers have accused the administration of lacking transparency about the strikes. A  closed-door briefing Thursday  lacked critical details and Pentagon lawyers were pulled from the session at the last minute, Democrats asserted last week.\n \n\n   \n  A day earlier, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner blasted the Trump administration for holding a briefing that day on the strikes but  not telling Democrats about it , calling the move “a partisan stunt.”\n \n\n   \n  While traveling in Asia on Friday, Hegseth insisted he had engaged Congress on a bipartisan basis regarding the strikes. However, that same day, Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, a Republican, and Ranking Member Jack Reed, a Democrat, released two letters they said they sent Hegseth over the past month seeking details about the operations but that have gone unanswered.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, Kaanita Iyer, and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/africa/western-kenya-landslide-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:09:00Z","title":"Landslide in western Kenya leaves 21 dead, 30 others missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly landslide in the Chesongoch area of Elgeyo Marakwet County, western Kenya, killed at least 21 people and left 30 others missing, following days of heavy rains during the country’s short rains season.

Now in the US, he’s looking for a way forward \n       \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Motaz Azaiza has witnessed the horrors of war. Now he’s trying to restore his faith in humanity. For 107 days, he was a photojournalist on the front lines of a warzone in his own familiar neighborhoods, documenting the carnage wrought by relentless Israeli airstrikes in such raw and unedited detail that it was impossible to ignore.\n \n\n   \n  Since mainstream news organizations were unable to film inside Gaza, Azaiza, like other Palestinian journalists in the strip, recorded the early days of the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two years, more than 68,000 people have been killed, according to local health officials in the enclave, and with over 90% of the residential buildings destroyed, most of the population has been internally displaced.\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza knows that he’s lucky to be alive. “My life is worth more now than if I was dead,” he told CNN earlier this month. “A lot of Gazans got killed. Nobody mentions their names.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 21 months since Azaiza escaped with his immediate family to Qatar; he’s now living in New York. He’s been working with aid groups to help the people of Gaza, and says he has raised $60 million and saved numerous lives. He recently launched a foundation to continue fundraising for Palestinians in Gaza, saying it will help to provide food and pastries, tanker trucks of clean water, blankets and shelter. “A candle in the darkness” is how he describes the Motaz Foundation to his Instagram followers, encouraging those in need to personally reach out for help.\n \n\n   \n  When asked at a recent event at the Muslim Wellness Center in Roswell, Georgia, why he named it after himself, he said that he simply couldn’t think of anything else to call it. But he’s proud of the work and it’s giving him purpose as he works through the traumatic upheaval of his life.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe this makes me forget the mental suffering that I’m in,” he pondered, leaning on the back of a pickup truck behind a Yemeni coffee shop which had just hosted a fundraising event for the foundation. “The moment I wire funds to people and get aid, support, and food, I feel high!” As he navigates a maelstrom of emotions, both his torment and his exhilaration are evident. “I’ve never been a useless person,” he said, “I’m always trying to be useful at every step.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 240 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led terror attack, in which more than 1,200 were killed and about 250 taken hostage, prompting Israel’s fierce military response. Israel denies targeting reporters, but Gaza has become the deadliest conflict zone ever for them, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he was receiving death threats via anonymous phone calls shortly before he left the strip and he knows that his story could easily have ended there. Does coming so close to death make him feel more alive? It’s complicated. “Yeah,” he responds, “because you don’t have anything to lose.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he has lost countless friends in Gaza. But he also feels as though he is dead inside. “My soul is turned off,” he said. Sometimes he felt lucky to survive – and luckier to escape – wrestling even now with survivors’ guilt, as do others who managed to flee the war  or  have witnessed it unfold from afar. “This is the feeling that people want me to feel,” he explains. “Or Israel wants me to feel, because if they defeat you inside then they don’t need to do anything else. I have it, but I’m trying not to allow it to control (me).”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he always wanted to be a photographer, but if violence hadn’t beaten a path to his door, then he would never have sought it out. He preferred taking artistic shots of bustling marketplaces or kids playing on the beach and resented that the outside world only seemed to be interested in paying for his work when he and Gaza’s other photojournalists competed for images depicting the most visceral scenes of the aftermath of an airstrike. His documentation of Israel’s response to the October 7 attack delivered him a massive social media following and professional success – his photo from October 31, 2023 of a woman trapped in a pancaked apartment building in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza was recognized as one of Time magazine’s  top 10 photographs of the year . But unlike his industry peers in other countries, he couldn’t celebrate the achievement because only his community’s extreme suffering had given him the opportunity to succeed.\n \n\n   \n    Dreams of war\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he feels that, somehow, fate chose him to be a bridge between the carnage in Gaza and the world outside, and he confides now that he foresaw his future many times before the war. Azaiza  would often dream of running through the streets in a press vest, a building next to him would blow up and he would bang his head on the ground before waking up, he said. The dream made no sense to him. “And then I found myself in the vest,” he said, “in the helmet, in the car (passing) the building that I saw in my dream. It was on fire. A lot of things that I imagined happened.”\n \n\n   \n  A young lady stood up to address him during one of the fundraising events in Georgia. “Thank you for opening our eyes,” she said, her voice cracking with emotion as she wiped tears from her cheeks. “Thank you for being alive, for being here. I’m so grateful for you.” Another man stood and hailed him a hero. “I’m not a hero,” Azaiza deflected, “I’m not Superman. I still have to wait in line for the toilet.”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza never wanted to be famous and, although he has more than 15 million followers on Instagram, he says that he’s the same man he was on October 6, 2023, just with more pressure on his shoulders. He’s learned the hard way that it’s impossible to stay out of politics when it comes to Gaza, where so many competing factions have their own agendas to promote; some of the people who used to applaud him now envy him and troll him with abuse on social media instead, he said. The hateful words are in some ways worse than the bullets, he said, because at least one knows how a bullet will hurt.\n \n\n   \n  “But this,” he paused for emphasis, “eats you from the inside, makes your heart tight, makes your stomach not able to eat, makes you overthink. And it hurts others around you, hurts your mom. The keyboard warriors, this is how Israel (can) win. They don’t need to divide us, we’re already divided.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s grateful for the ceasefire, and an end to the killing, but he doesn’t think it’s fair to the Palestinians. “I just wanted the genocide to stop,” he explained. “We’ve been calling for it to stop since October 9. Give them (Israel) the hostages. But nobody listened to us until we lost it all.\n \n\n   \n  “Now it sounds like peace that is giving Israel more peace and more power, they got what they wanted after the massacre, the whole strip. Maybe it’s going to last, because, like, there’s nothing left.”\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, echoing the findings of other genocide experts and human rights groups, all of which Israel has rejected.\n \n\n   \n  For now, Azaiza is focused on his humanitarian work but living in a kind of limbo. He dreams of returning to Gaza to build a home by the sea but wonders what kind of life he would be returning to. He says he’d like to be Gaza’s Minister of Youth one day but knows that many politicians become corrupt; he’d love to start a family too.\n \n\n   \n  Most of all, he dreams of working with his camera in a simpler life. “You know Tarzan?” he asked rhetorically. “I want to be Tarzan with a camera. I wish to go to Tanzania with my camera, capture lions and animals. I don’t want to capture any human anymore, humans bring problems, bring pain, and bring troubles. No humans anymore, only animals, that’s it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/pennsylvania-catholic-school-halloween-float-holocaust-imagery","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:25:00-04:00","title":"Pennsylvania diocese condemns Holocaust imagery displayed on Catholic school’s Halloween parade float","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Catholic school in Hanover, Pennsylvania, displayed a replica of the Auschwitz gate with the phrase 'Arbeit Macht Frei' during a Halloween parade float, prompting immediate condemnation from the Diocese of Harrisburg.

Nigeria \n       \n  By Alejandra Jaramillo, Nimi Princewill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:59 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump said Saturday he has ordered the Defense Department to prepare for possible military action in Nigeria as he continues to accuse the nation of not doing enough to stem violence against Christians — an accusation Nigeria has repeatedly denied.\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post criticizing what he called the “mass slaughter” of Christians in the country, Trump  wrote  the United States would “immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria” and warned the government there to “move fast.”\n \n\n   \n  In the lengthy message, Trump said the US “may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’ to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”\n \n\n   \n  Both Christians and Muslims have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists in the country of more than 230 million people. The violence in the country is driven by varying factors: some incidents are religiously motivated and affect both groups, while others arise from disputes between farmers and herders over limited resources, as well as communal and ethnic tensions.\n \n\n   \n  Although Christians are among those targeted, local reports indicate that most victims are Muslims living in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north.\n \n\n   \n  “I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action,” Trump wrote. “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!”\n \n\n   \n  “Yes sir,” US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth posted on social media with a screenshot of Trump’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “The killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria — and anywhere — must end immediately. The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s announcement comes after he accused Nigeria of religious freedom violations on Friday, claiming that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and designating the nation as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the  International Religious Freedom Act . The label is a suggestion that his administration has found that Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post after the designation, but before Trump’s mention of the military, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu  wrote : “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that Nigeria is “working with the United States government and the international community to deepen understanding and cooperation on protection of communities of all faiths.”\n \n\n   \n  Tinubu’s press secretary, responding to a social media post from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemning the “slaughter of thousands of Christians,” called the characterization “a gross exaggeration of the Nigerian situation,” adding that “Christians, Muslims, churches and mosques are attacked randomly.”\n \n\n   \n  “What our country requires from America is military support to fight these violent extremists in some states of our country, not designation as a nation of particular concern,” said Bayo Onanuga.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespersons for the White House and Tinubu’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/obama-campaign-nj-virginia-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:21:00-04:00","title":"Obama Campaigns for Sherrill, Spanberger on Saturday in Home Stretch of Gubernatorial Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the final days of the 2025 gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, former President Barack Obama campaigned with Democratic nominees Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, urging voters to reject President Donald Trump’s second term and restore democratic norms.

Spanberger on Saturday in home stretch of gubernatorial elections \n       \n  By Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:21 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former President Barack Obama urged voters to break with President Donald Trump and “set a glorious example for the nation” on Saturday as he campaigned with the Democratic nominees for governor in Virginia and New Jersey ahead of Tuesday’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  In his first of two events Saturday, a rally with former Rep. Abigail Spanberger — the Democrat facing Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s governor race — Obama told the crowd in Norfolk that after the first nine months of Trump’s second term, “the stakes are now clear.”\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don’t need to wonder about whether vulnerable people are going to be hurt, or ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. We’ve witnessed it. Elections do matter,” he said. “We all have more power than we think. We just have to use it.”\n \n\n   \n  With the Democratic Party out of power in Washington and without a clear national leader, Obama is reprising his role as the party’s biggest and most unifying draw, delivering a closing message in the final days of elections that will serve as a temperature check on Trump’s first year and set the stage for next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey later Saturday, Obama told voters the state should “point America in a better direction” by electing Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat who is taking on GOP former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli in the governor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  He mocked Ciattarelli for saying in a debate that Trump deserves an “A” grade for his performance in office.\n \n\n   \n  “I know there’s been grade inflation, but really? An A? This is the best we could do? I mean, these are the same folks who put secret war plans in a group chat,” referring to the  Signal scandal . “You don’t think there’s anything they could be doing better?”\n \n\n   \n  Before heading out to the rallies on Saturday, Obama called Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City. He has not endorsed Mamdani — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the former president was sharply critical of Trump — though he only once used his name.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us are being tested right now,” Obama said. “Trump and the Republicans — they want you to think it’s part of their story, that things only happen from the top down; that a few people in power make decisions and the rest of us have to live with the consequences. But real change has always come from the bottom up; from ordinary folks who look around and say, we can do better, and then join together to make change happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Obama said he knew what Trump planned to do, but added that he “will admit, it’s worse than even I expected.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he worries about “how quickly basic democratic rules and norms have been weakened.” Obama also said he is concerned about “the growing concentration of economic power in this country,” and that business leaders, law firms and universities “have been willing to bend the knee to this president’s autocratic impulses” to avoid confrontation.\n \n\n   \n  He also criticized Trump’s replacement of career prosecutors with loyalists at the Justice Department, his “shambolic tariff policy” and said the White House every day delivers “lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like every day is Halloween, except it’s all tricks and no treats,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Nine years after leaving office, Obama remains the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate — a reality underscored by his high-profile appearances on the final weekend of two of 2025’s most important contests. Obama has also  stepped up his warnings  about what he says is the damage being wrought to the country by President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The crowd in Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday waited about five hours for Obama to speak, but that didn’t damper their enthusiasm. When Spanberger introduced Obama, the cheers for him were so loud you couldn’t hear her. The 7,000-seat arena was near capacity.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger sought to tie Tuesday’s election to a signal Democrats can send to the nation.\n \n\n   \n  “With the political turmoil coming out of Washington right now, this election is an opportunity, because in just three more days, when the polls close, Virginia voters can and will send a message. Amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington, Virginia can and will flip statewide seats from red to blue,” Spanberger said.\n \n\n   \n  The event served as an important base motivator on the last day of early voting.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m concerned about the deterioration of the country, the way people are treated. The sadness of everything that’s happening, it’s heartbreaking,” Gail Buchanan of Chesterfield, Virginia told CNN at the rally.\n \n\n   \n  Also of note, Virginia’s Democratic nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones, spoke though he was not listed as a planned speaker. Jones has been under fire for  violent language  he sent about a colleague in recently surfaced text messages in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Obama is the closer after a number of ambitious Democrats have  also hit the trail  for Sherrill and Spanberger. The list of Democratic governors to campaign with Spanberger and Sherrill includes Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Maryland’s Wes Moore, Illinois’ JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  Obama has slowly ramped up his involvement in both gubernatorial elections. He cut ads for both candidates that began airing in mid-October.\n \n\n   \n  After voting in Bridgewater on Friday, Ciattarelli — whose near miss in the 2021 New Jersey governor’s race was an early indicator of the state’s rightward shift in the 2024 presidential race, when Trump closed his losing margin from 16 percentage points in 2020 to 6 points last year — downplayed any impact Obama’s appearance with Sherrill might have in the closing days of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what I refer to as the choreography of campaigns, but at the end of day, I really believe this, particularly in New Jersey, a candidate has to win the race, and that’s why I get up and down the state every day and engage with people every day, shake hands every single day.” Ciattarelli said. “I think we’ve done that a hell of a lot better than my opponent.”\n \n\n   \n  The Virginia and New Jersey governor’s races, which are held a year after presidential elections, are widely viewed as an important gauge of the nation’s political mood almost a year into a new presidency. One year into Obama’s White House tenure, Republican Bob McDonnell’s win in Virginia and Chris Christie’s win in New Jersey offered previews of the red wave that was to come in the 2010 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger and Sherrill are favored in the blue-leaning states, but wins are no lock: Four years ago, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governor race; in New Jersey, Sherrill hasn’t been able to pull away after several public polls found her with a single-digit edge over Ciattarelli.\n \n\n   \n  Both of Obama’s Saturday stops — Newark and Norfolk — are in areas with significant Black populations. Over the last several election cycles he has appeared often with Virginia Democratic candidates at base-rallying events in the Hampton Roads region.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arlette Saenz, Eva McKend, Eric Fiegel﻿, Edward-Isaac Dovere and Dalia Abdelwahab contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/snap-benefits-november-most-affected-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:55:00Z","title":"Millions of Americans Could Face Delays in SNAP Benefits Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to a government shutdown, millions of Americans faced delays in receiving their SNAP food benefits in November 2025.

Mace’s Director of Operations Cameron Morabito told CNN in a statement, “Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you’re leading the race for governor.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are forced to take the congresswoman’s safety extremely seriously,” Morabito said. “After the world watched Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the threats against her have only intensified. Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicize this reality is both dangerous and reckless.”\n \n\n   \n  Mace also briefly spoke with the Times, saying she did complain to the airport because she is concerned about her safety given recent death threats against her. “We all get frustrated when it’s not taken seriously,” she told the outlet.\n \n\n   \n    Mace ran late, arrived in different vehicle\n \n\n   \n  Two Charleston County Aviation Authority police officers were informed at 6 a.m. they would need to escort Mace from the curb to her flight, according to an incident report filed by the officers.

No other people were visible in the video.

It appears an airport employee made a call to an unknown person, and approximately three minutes later the two officers arrived to escort Mace. It took about seven minutes from the time Mace appears at the known crewmember entrance and starts interacting with airport employees to when the escorting officers arrive, according to the video.\n \n\n   \n  Mace allegedly continued cursing at the officers and into her phone while they walked with her to the gate, according to the account of one officer.

Trump administration to use emergency funds to partially cover food stamp benefits \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:40 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover  food stamp benefits  for tens of millions of Americans in November.\n \n\n   \n  The rulings from judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island reject a controversial US Department of Agriculture claim that it could not use a contingency fund, which the agency says has $5.3 billion remaining in it, to help cover the benefits amid the month-long government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, President Donald Trump said he has instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible because the attorneys “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available.”\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social Friday evening. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, costs between $8 billion and $9 billion a month, so the judges’ orders will not cover all of the needed payments for November.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt that the … contingency funds are appropriated funds that are without a doubt necessary to carry out the program’s operation.” US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island said. “The shutdown of the government through funding doesn’t do away with SNAP, it just does away with the funding of it.”\n \n\n   \n  During proceedings Friday, McConnell said he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure at least some benefits could be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur, if it hasn’t already occurred, in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In a written ruling released Saturday, McConnell wrote that the administration must make a partial payment to SNAP beneficiaries using the contingency funds by Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But he wrote the USDA should, within its discretion, find additional funds to provide full benefits to recipients. If the agency chooses this option, it must make the full payment by the end of Monday, as making the full payment is simpler than calculating partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  In his ruling, McConnell also responded directly to Trump’s comments Friday, writing, “the Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”\n \n\n   \n  McConnell’s ruling during a hastily scheduled hearing came minutes after US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston made a similar order. Both judges, appointees of President Barack Obama, also said that USDA is allowed to tap into another bucket of money of nearly $17 billion to pay November SNAP benefits in full, but that decision is currently up to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program. And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds … to avoid any reductions,”  Talwani said in a 15-page order. \n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration opposes tapping into those other funds, arguing in court it will hurt the child nutrition programs that the revenue supports.\n \n\n   \n  Even with Trump’s directive and the judge’s rulings, millions of recipients will still face delays in getting their benefits, which were scheduled to start being distributed on November 1. It will take time for the Department of Agriculture and states to get the money flowing again.\n \n\n   \n  In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  The Boston lawsuit was filed earlier this week by a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the case in Rhode Island was brought Thursday by a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could seek appeals. Asked earlier Friday by CNN what the department would do if courts required USDA to tap into the contingency fund, Secretary Brooke Rollins said, “We’re looking at all the options.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.\n \n\n   \n  Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information ahead of the new month in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\n \n\n   \n  Talwani acknowledged the likely delay in benefits during a hearing Thursday, and also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/snap-benefits-november-judge-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:38:00-04:00","title":"Will SNAP benefits be paid in November?

Here’s what we know about the judges’ rulings \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:38 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges have said the Trump administration is required to use  emergency funds  to provide at least partial  food stamp benefits  to tens of millions of Americans in November, as the federal government shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  And President Donald Trump on Friday evening said that he’s instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the much-needed assistance won’t come that quickly for many food stamp recipients. Also, it remains unclear whether they’ll receive their full benefits or a smaller amount since the US Department of Agriculture’s contingency fund doesn’t have enough money to cover the total cost.\n \n\n   \n  Several legal and procedural challenges must be overcome before the benefits can start flowing to the nearly 42 million people in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. The US Department of Agriculture halted November allocations, arguing it  doesn’t have the funds  to provide them, which prompted  a coalition of Democratic-led states  and a group of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to sue earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  It’s now unclear whether the administration will appeal the rulings. However, the Justice Department signaled during a hearing on Thursday that it would do so if US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston issued an adverse ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  A judge in Rhode Island said during proceedings Friday in a separate case over the SNAP payments that he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure at least some benefits could be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  In a written ruling released Saturday, the judge, John McConnell, wrote that the administration must make a partial payment to SNAP beneficiaries using the contingency funds by Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But he wrote the USDA should, within its discretion, find additional funds to provide full benefits to recipients. If it chooses to do this, the agency must make the full payment by the end of Monday since it is simpler to make the full payment than calculate partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could also appeal this decision.\n \n\n   \n  In his ruling, McConnell also responded directly to Trump’s comments Friday, writing, “the Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  Whatever happens in court, it will take time for SNAP recipients to get access to any assistance in November.\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of  issuing benefits for November  after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  The delay will be felt immediately. Some 3 million recipients should receive their benefits on November 1, according to an estimate by Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. The number grows to nearly 13.7 million by November 5, with remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not going out on time,” Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said of the November benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Still, providing full payments would be the fastest way to get assistance to food stamp recipients.\n \n\n   \n  “If the administration complies with the courts’ rulings to release the SNAP contingency funds immediately and supplements those amounts using its legal transfer authority, which the courts also affirmed, then SNAP benefits could begin to be issued with only a short delay,” said Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n    Partial payments harder to do\n \n\n   \n  However, the process could become much more complicated — and time consuming — if the USDA opts to only tap into its contingency fund and doesn’t augment it with leftover tariff revenue dedicated to child nutrition programs, as it did with the  WIC nutrition assistance program .\n \n\n   \n  The emergency fund only has $5.3 billion remaining in it, while benefits total about $8.2 billion for the month, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which represents the USDA in the case. (Other expenses and benefits bring the total closer to $9 billion.)\n \n\n   \n  The USDA also has access to nearly $17 billion in tariff revenue, but a Justice Department attorney told a judge Friday that using the funds for SNAP would hurt the child nutrition programs that the money supports. Both Talwani and the judge in Rhode Island, John McConnell, left it up to the USDA to decide whether to use the additional resources to pay full benefits in November.\n \n\n   \n  If only the contingency fund were tapped, the USDA would have to reduce benefits for all SNAP recipients, which it has never done, according to a declaration filed by the agency official who oversees the program. Also, state agencies would need to recode their systems to issue the smaller benefit amounts, which could result in payment errors.\n \n\n   \n  “Because no template, processes, or past experience exist to inform a reduction in benefits, there are multiple variables which could lead to significant problems in attempting to reduce benefits for every SNAP household in the country,” Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of the USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said in his declaration. “The ability, time and resources to accomplish this system change would vary greatly among State agencies, with some State agencies working with systems that are decades old.”\n \n\n   \n  For at least some states, the process could take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, Penn said, drawing upon informal conversations with state agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Before states could even act, the USDA would also have to determine how to calculate and authorize the reduced allotments. This effort could be hampered if its employees have been furloughed during the shutdown or laid off or departed amid the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government, Plata-Nino said.\n \n\n   \n  While some states have identified potential ways to issue smaller benefits quickly, the methods must be programmed, tested and verified, which could take time, she noted.\n \n\n   \n  If recipients receive partial benefits in November, they would get retroactive payments to make them whole once the government reopens, she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/trump-white-house-press-limits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:34:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration restricts reporters’ access to White House press secretary’s office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on journalists’ access to the White House press secretary’s office, requiring appointments to enter the 'Upper Press' area where Karoline Leavitt works.

House press corps are now restricted from the press secretary’s office, the latest in a series of Trump administration actions to limit media access.\n \n\n   \n  The new rule says journalists cannot access what’s known as the “Upper Press” office space, where White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt works, “without an appointment.”\n \n\n   \n  This area has been accessible to White House correspondents for decades, supporting a free flow of information between the president and the public.\n \n\n   \n  The White House says the clampdown is due to security concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “This policy will ensure adherence to best practices pertaining to access to sensitive material,” a White House memo asserted on Friday night.\n \n\n   \n  In response, the White House Correspondents’ Association, which represents hundreds of credentialed reporters, said it “unequivocally opposes any effort” to limit journalists from areas that have long been accessible for newsgathering, “including the press secretary’s office.”\n \n\n   \n  “The new restrictions hinder the press corps’ ability to question officials, ensure transparency, and hold the government accountable, to the detriment of the American public,” the association said.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN’s Jeff Zeleny explained, reporters routinely “wait in the hall” by the press secretary’s office and seek information from communications aides. “When there is breaking news, that often happens,” Zeleny said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, “reporters will only have access to a smaller set of offices of junior advisers, junior aides, junior press secretaries,” according to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  White House communications director Steven Cheung’s office is also deemed off-limits due to the change.\n \n\n   \n  Cheung, who regularly expresses hostility toward reporters on social media platform X, asserted in a Friday night post that, “some reporters have been caught” taking pictures of sensitive information and “eavesdropping on private, closed-door meetings.”\n \n\n   \n  That claim came as news to White House press corps leaders, who are not aware of colleagues being “caught.”\n \n\n   \n  Early in Bill Clinton’s presidency, Clinton aides similarly attempted to bar journalists from the “upper press” area, causing an outcry. That ban was rescinded.\n \n\n   \n  Journalists had normal access to the offices during President Trump’s first term in office. But in his second term, Trump and his aides have taken several steps to stymie news coverage and circumvent traditional media outlets.\n \n\n   \n  Last winter, the administration blocked the Associated Press   from attending some White House events, leading to a First Amendment lawsuit that is still working its way through the courts.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has also stopped publishing transcripts of Trump’s remarks; has taken control of daily press pool assignments; and has invited fawning pro-Trump commentators to presidential Q&As.\n \n\n   \n  Some cabinet secretaries have followed Trump’s lead. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth implemented severe new restrictions for Pentagon press pass credentialing, leading virtually every major media outlet to reject the rules and give up access to the Pentagon complex.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/fbi-fires-agent-trump-investigations","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:52:00-05:00","title":"FBI forces out special agent who helped oversee Trump investigation, sources say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI has reportedly forced out special agent Aaron Tapp, who previously oversaw key investigations into Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including the Arctic Frost probe into fake electors.

CNN\n \n   \n  The FBI has forced out a special agent who previously helped oversee public corruption cases, including an investigation that became part of former special counsel Jack Smith’s probe into President Donald Trump, according to two sources familiar with the matter — another apparent casualty of the Trump administration’s retribution push.\n \n\n   \n  Aaron Tapp, the special agent in

later this month, a third person briefed on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For a time he had oversight of probes into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. One of these investigations — known as Arctic Frost — focused on the fake electors scheme, in which Trump allies sought to have Trump electors counted as electoral college votes from states that Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Republicans have released FBI records showing details of the Arctic Frost investigation and accused Smith and FBI leaders of political motives in using grand jury subpoenas to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers. The records, obtained in 2023, covered four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot . The FBI didn’t obtain the contents of the calls.

Driscoll and other senior officials resisted efforts to try to fire or otherwise punish all FBI agents or employees for simply having worked on criminal investigations of Trump, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Patel and other officials, during Senate confirmation hearings, had dismissed any plans for political retribution, despite Trump’s repeated threats during his campaign rallies to do exactly that.\n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Aaron Tapp had been fired.

The NYPD’s future is also at stake \n       \n  By Mark Morales, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:22 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With the  high-stakes New York mayoral contest  hanging in the balance, the largest police department in the country may find itself caught between the promise of reform and the stability that followed a couple of scandal-scarred years.\n \n\n   \n  If  Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani  wins the election, his choice to lead the NYPD through a period of political transition is already in the job: current Commissioner Jessica Tisch.\n \n\n   \n  While Tisch has managed to earn praise from representatives from both political parties as well as business leaders, her stance on various key issues, from the use of the NYPD’s gang database to the deployment of a specialized unit that responds to protests and major events, stands in opposition to what Mamdani has promised during the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Despite their stark differences in policing strategies, Mamdani has said each hire he makes for his new administration would be in lock step with his vision for the future. Tisch has declined to publicly address the prospect of staying on as police commissioner, but Mamdani has said he is confident she would accept the position, leaving former police officials and advocates to wonder how both would coexist.\n \n\n   \n  While the New York City police commissioner technically answers to and is appointed by the mayor, a savvy police executive can always carve out some autonomy despite an administration’s reform promises.\n \n\n   \n  “She has leverage over him at the moment, and leverage in the sense of negotiating,” former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said of Tisch, a former sanitation department commissioner. “I think she would be willing to stay if some of her conditions, whatever they may be, be met.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani officially announced his intention to keep Tisch as commissioner from a debate stage on October 22.\n \n\n   \n  “I make the decision to retain Commissioner Tisch not only to build on the results that we’ve seen under her tenure, but also to deliver on the agenda that I’ve been running on,” Mamdani told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Tisch said she was staying out of the fray.\n \n\n   \n  “As I’ve said many times, it is not appropriate for the Police Commissioner to be directly involved or to seem to be involved in electoral politics,” Tisch said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    Flashback to over a decade ago\n \n\n   \n  Public safety has been a major issue in the hotly contested mayor’s race that pits Democratic socialist Mamdani against former New York Gov. and  independent candidate Andrew Cuomo  and the  Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa . Cuomo and Sliwa each have said they would keep Tisch as police commissioner.\n \n\n   \n  Judging by the early voting numbers,  New Yorkers are already flocking to the polls .\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the course of the campaign,  Mamdani has moderated some of his most controversial stances  on policing, distancing himself from a previous call to defund the police and apologizing for calling police officers “racist” and “wicked.”\n \n\n   \n  Bratton, an experienced police executive who ran the NYPD twice, was in a similar position in which Tisch may find herself when he came back for the second time during the start of Bill de Blasio’s administration in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  While de Blasio was known as a progressive who rankled many of the rank-and-file, Bratton said they shared the same vision when it came to incorporating neighborhood policing, de-escalation training, more police officers on the street and a robust budget to operate the department, Bratton said.\n \n\n   \n  As a condition of accepting the appointment, Bratton said, he made sure he could pick his team and had the freedom to make decisions without interference.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Tisch appear to be further apart philosophically than he was from de Blasio, according to Bratton.\n \n\n   \n  “The worst thing that can happen for (Mamdani) is, if (Tisch) were to step away, a successor comes in, crime goes up and disorder goes up. And the potential for that is very, very significant,” Bratton said.\n \n\n   \n   Bratton’s retirement as police commissioner in September 2016  came at a time of record declines in crime but heightened distrust of police by minority communities, after the death of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of police on Staten Island in 2014, sparked protests.\n \n\n   \n    Conflicting philosophies emerge\n \n\n   \n  Tisch took over as police commissioner in November of last year, just a week before prosecutors allege Luigi Mangione gunned down the UnitedHealthcare CEO in midtown Manhattan. Since then, Tisch has made her mark on the department, replacing many loyalists of former Mayor Eric Adams who were in positions of power, shuffling others around, and accepting the resignation of  former Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey  after he was embroiled in an overtime-for-sexual-favors scandal.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also touted the importance of the controversial NYPD gang database used to track gang members, attacked the “Raise the Age” law, which increased the age of criminal prosecution from 16 to 18, and gone after bail reform laws – all positions that are at odds with Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  The candidate has also spoken out about disbanding the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group – an elite unit that specializes in responding to major events, whether they be protests or even the midtown mass shooting at 345 Park Ave. Mamdani also wants the final disciplinary decision on officers to go from the police commissioner to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the city agency charged with oversight of the NYPD – though that would need a change to the law. Both are ideas that routinely spark sharp criticism from law enforcement circles.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the seeming differences, if Tisch were to stay, it would provide stability for officers not only out on the street, but for high-ranking officials who would otherwise be walking on eggshells inside police headquarters as they wait for a new administration to take over.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it calms a lot of the cops who may have been nervous. That there’s not going to be this big, dramatic change overnight,” said  former NYPD Chief of Department Kenneth Corey,  who was the highest-ranked uniformed member of the department on Adams’ first day as mayor in 2022. “Whether they like (Tisch) or not, she’s the devil they know and it also helps calm the business community, who are also very worried about the prospect of what crime would look like under a Mamdani administration.”\n \n\n   \n    Mental health response would be focus\n \n\n   \n  While there may not be wholesale changes to the NYPD if Tisch stays as police commissioner, there would be new initiatives under Mamdani, such as a new civilian agency called the Department of Community Safety. The agency would focus on a community-based prevention approach targeting homelessness and people experiencing mental illness.\n \n\n   \n  Its hallmark won’t be adding more police but rather adding more mental health professionals and violence interrupters – a plan Mamdani says he hopes would free up officers to respond to other crimes.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023, the NYPD responded to under 180,000 calls that involved an emotionally disturbed person, out of roughly 9 million 911 calls, according to statistics unveiled at a city hall hearing in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Corey said he tried to get a similar plan off the ground but had trouble with appropriate staffing.\n \n\n   \n  “The city is not the greatest employer when it comes to pay. You’re going to hire clinicians and social workers and people with advanced degrees. You’re not going to pay them a whole lot of money,” Corey said. “Then you’re going to tell them, ‘Oh, by the way, you know you’re working Christmas morning, or you’re working the midnight shift every weekend.’ These are the challenges we ran into when we’ve tried to do that before, even as a co-response model. There are just not enough of these clinicians and mental health professionals who are willing to go out into the street and do this kind of work in the hours that it needs to be done.”\n \n\n   \n   Richard Aborn , president of the nonprofit   Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, supports mental health professionals being involved but wonders about safety.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it makes a lot of sense to have mental health teams go on calls when there’s an emotionally disturbed person, but having a mental health team go exclusively could be dangerous,” Aborn said. “The question is, how are you going to assess that? A call comes into 911, there’s a person locked up in the bedroom screaming, ‘I’m going to kill you.’ Who’s going to assess whether it’s just a mental health team or if police officers go along?”\n \n\n   \n  Corey recalled a scenario when a woman called 911 asking for help for her son, telling dispatchers they were nonviolent.\n \n\n   \n  “If you heard her, she almost sounded like she was sleeping,” Corey said about the woman’s 911 call. “And she’s just ‘no, he’s not violent. He just needs to go. Somebody just needs to take him to the hospital so he can get his medicine,’ and 11 seconds after the police officers were in the apartment, there was a cop flat on his back. This guy was straddled, with a butcher knife, over him, and (NYPD) shot him.” The man was killed in the shooting, according to Corey.\n \n\n   \n    The specter of the National Guard\n \n\n   \n  Looming in the distance as well is the threat of potential federal intervention into crime-fighting in New York City, should Mamdani win the election.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has spoken out about President Donald Trump sending National Guard troops into Democrat-run major cities, a move the president says is to restore law and order. Mamdani previously told CNN he would respond to the attempt by filing a lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  “What we would do in running this city, is first, to actually take this administration to court and to do so immediately as opposed to being pressured to do it,” Mamdani said, adding he would follow in the footsteps of other leaders like  Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. \n \n\n   \n  Bratton is among those current and former law enforcement leaders who say the sheer size and scope of the NYPD, in addition to low crime numbers, are strong indicators New York City doesn’t need the National Guard – who are already deployed but work in a different capacity  –  to patrol the streets in that way.\n \n\n   \n  It may not even come to that, Bratton said, if Tisch, a billionaire heiress from one of New York City’s most prominent families, remains at the helm.\n \n\n   \n  “Jesse and her family have very good relations with a number of the Trump side of the house,” Bratton said. “Jesse also brings a form of stability against the tide that we know is going to put pressure up against New York, and she has the ability, I think, to dissipate some of what’s going on in Los Angeles and Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Tisch took over for interim police commissioner Tom Donlon, who has since gone on to  file a lawsuit alleging corruption  at the highest levels of the NYPD. She became the fourth police commissioner appointed during the Adams administration – a constant change that became emblematic of the instability and air of corruption   at the department.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the department is struggling with staffing issues as members continue to either retire or get poached by other police departments in other cities. There are currently less than 35,000 members with the NYPD, a figure that’s less than highs in 2000 and 2019, according to statistics provided by the Police Benevolent Association.\n \n\n   \n  So far this year, roughly 300 officers have left the department each month, according to the union’s statistics.   NYPD recruit classes continue to lag behind the number of recruits in previous classes, according to a union official.\n \n\n   \n  As staffing is a constant issue, Mayor Eric Adams announced a plan to potentially add 5,000 new police officers to the department by 2029, a move that would boost the department’s headcount to the largest it’s been in the last 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  While the move opens the door to adding more officers, it still leaves the issue of actually finding enough recruits to fill the hiring surge. In April, city officials changed the eligibility standard for recruits, eliminating the need for college credit. The move bolstered applications, with 4,000 ineligible applicants – who did not meet the requirements – reopening their cases, according to city officials.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, who credited Tisch with rooting out corruption, believes she has shown during a turbulent period that she’s committed to the department.\n \n\n   \n  The high turnover among top police executives, is something Corey says rank and file officers – who may find themselves having to execute  progressive strategies they may not agree with – have noticed.\n \n\n   \n  “What the cops have learned at the bottom is that, ‘If I don’t like your idea, I don’t actually have to do it,’” Corey said. “‘I just need to slow walk it, because you’re going to be gone soon, and so will your idea.’”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/uk/us-lawmakers-urge-andrew-to-address-epstein-links-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00-05:00","title":"US Lawmakers Intensify Calls for Andrew to Address Epstein Ties","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following King Charles III's decision to strip Andrew Mountbatten Windsor of his royal title and evict him from Windsor Castle due to public outrage over his behavior, US lawmakers—particularly Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee—have intensified demands for Andrew to voluntarily testify about his alleged ties to the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

(See the recent controversy over  AI actress Tilly Norwood. ) But as loud as the concerns might be, AI continues to grow in the arts.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 146,000 followers on  Instagram alone , Monet is proof that consumers are increasingly open to the idea, even if the industry is riled by it.\n \n\n   \n  Monet’s Apple Music artist profile explains that Monet is “an Al figure presented as a contemporary R&B vocalist in the highly expressive, church-bred, down-to-earth vein of Keyshia Cole, K. Michelle, and Muni Long.”\n \n\n   \n  Monet was designed by Telisha Nikki Jones, a poet from Mississippi who writes the lyrics Monet is seen performing with help from Suno, “a generative artificial intelligence music creation program,” the bio explains.\n \n\n   \n  Monet released a full-length album “Unfolded” in August, which had 24 songs. A seven-track EP, “Pieces Left Behind,” followed in September.\n \n\n   \n  A press release from Monet’s representative touted the AI singer’s “smooth, soulful sound” and “human-like delivery.” But Romel Murphy, who says he’s Monet’s manager and spoke with  CNN’s Victor Blackwell,  insisted that there is no intent to replace human singers and songwriters.\n \n\n   \n  “AI doesn’t replace the artist. That’s not our goal at all. It doesn’t diminish the creativity and doesn’t take away from the human experience,” he said. “It’s a new frontier and like anything would change some people are receptive and some people are apprehensive.”\n \n\n   \n  Billboard recently reported that “in just the past few months, at least six AI or AI-assisted artists have debuted on various Billboard rankings.”\n \n\n   \n  “That figure could be higher, as it’s become increasingly difficult to tell who or what is powered by AI — and to what extent,” according to the publication. “Many of these charting projects, whose music spans every genre from gospel to rock to country, also arrive with anonymous or mysterious origins.”\n \n\n   \n  Murphy doesn’t appear to see an issue and likens it all to the music of Michael Jackson and Prince, who died in 2009 and 2016 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  “They both have music catalogs that are expanding decades to this day. Youth are still listening to those songs and they’re no longer with us and they’re connected to their music,” Murphy said. “So it is the music because they don’t have the history of the contact or the concert live field, but they still love those songs. Music has to evolve as well.”\n \n\n   \n  “We just have to keep the integrity and be intentional about the realness of it and push the music to the world,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Monet’s representative for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, working musicians are – as expected– troubled.\n \n\n   \n  “There is an AI R&B artist who just signed a multimillion-dollar deal … and the person is doing none of the work,” Kehlani  said  of Monet in a now-deleted video posted to TikTok. “This is so beyond out of our control.”\n \n\n   \n  The human singer added: “Nothing and no one on Earth will ever be able to justify AI to me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/early-voting-elections-nyc-virginia-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"What early voting data says about NYC, Virginia and New Jersey elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Early voting data from New York City, New Jersey, and Virginia suggests that Democratic candidates are in stronger positions than Kamala Harris was at the same point in 2024.

 \n  By Edward Wu, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Early voting data suggests that  Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia  are heading into the final weekend in a slightly stronger position than Kamala Harris was at the same time last year.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City,  Andrew Cuomo  may be in a stronger position than in the primary, but there are signs of increased activity from younger voters, a key part of  Zohran Mamdani’s base .\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s experts analyzed the pre-election voting data in all three locations, comparing to 2024 in New Jersey and Virginia to better reflect the changes in early voting patterns over the last four years.\n \n\n   \n  Although early voting analysis can provide hints about which candidates may be well positioned heading into November 4, it is impossible to know who pre-election voters supported or how candidates will do on Election Day, when many of the ballots will be cast.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey: A Democratic turnout advantage\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Democrats have turned out at a higher rate than Republican voters in both mail and early in-person voting, putting the Democratic candidate for governor, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in a stronger position than Harris was last year at this point. Harris eventually won the state by about 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  Through the end of Thursday, registered Democrats led registered Republicans in mail ballot returns by over 41 points, a couple of points better than the 39-point gap at this point last year. But unlike last year, Democrats also hold a nearly 2-point lead in in-person early voting. Last year at this time, Democrats trailed in in-person voting by 2 points.\n \n\n   \n  Mail ballots also represent a larger portion of the pre-election vote so far. As a result, registered Democrats represent a larger share of the total pre-election electorate than they did at this point last year.\n \n\n   \n    New York City: Older voters have turned out more; younger voters are catching up\n \n\n   \n  Among registered Democrats, a group that will make up the lion’s share of New York City mayoral voters, older voters have turned out more so far than they did during the primary, when strong backing from younger voters helped propel Mamdani to a surprise victory. But the electorate is still younger than in past mayoral elections and has only been getting younger as the week has gone on.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis of early voting data from the New York City Board of Elections has found that through October 31, about 53% of registered Democratic voters (55% of all voters so far) are ages 50 and up, while almost 16% of Democratic voters are ages 18 to 29 (15% of voters overall).\n \n\n   \n  That’s more weighted towards older voters than the total Democratic   primary electorate, when about 48% were 50 or older and about 18% of voters were 18-29, according to data from L2.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown that younger voters overwhelmingly favor Mamdani, while Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has a smaller lead among older voters.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s turnout is still younger than the city’s last mayoral election in 2021, when just 9% of voters were ages 18 to 29 and 62% were ages 50 and older.\n \n\n   \n  Over the course of the week, daily turnout among Democrats has gotten younger: while older voters outnumbered younger ones by about 50 percentage points on the first day of early voting, that dropped below 20 points on the seventh day.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of Democratic votes has also been more favorable to Cuomo than it was in the June primary, with turnout strongest so far in precincts where Cuomo did best and relatively weaker in strong Mamdani areas. The most Cuomo-friendly precincts have cast 125% of their primary early in-person totals while the most Mamdani-friendly precincts have cast 85% of their early voting totals.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if the precinct-level Mamdani vs. Cuomo vote from the primary stayed the same, the changes so far in geographic distribution alone wouldn’t be nearly enough for Cuomo to overtake Mamdani among Democratic early voters.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia: Spanberger appears in slightly stronger position\n \n\n   \n  While voters don’t register by party in Virginia, the geographic breakdown of votes cast so far suggests Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is in slightly stronger position heading into the final stretch than Harris was at the same point in last year’s election, when she won Virginia by less than 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of early in-person votes has slightly favored Republicans, while the distribution of mail ballots is similar to what it was at this point last year. But mail ballots, in which Democrats typically perform better, make up a larger share of the pre-election vote this year (24%) than they did at this point last year (21%), resulting in a geographic breakdown of the combined pre-election vote that is more Democratic-leaning relative to the same point in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  Through Thursday, counties where Trump won last year are averaging 61% of their in-person votes cast at the equivalent point last year, while Harris-won counties are at just over 57%. The worst performing counties so far have been places where Trump won more than 75% of the vote – they’re at just 54% of the in-person votes they’d cast at this point last year.\n \n\n   \n  And that gap between Trump- and Harris-won counties has been narrowing over the course of the last week, dropping from 10 points to 4 points now, largely coinciding with an increased number of voting locations opening in large Democratic-leaning counties such as  Arlington  and  Fairfax .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/berkshire-hathaway-profits-buffett","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00.000Z","title":"Berkshire profit rises, cash soars to record","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Berkshire Hathaway reported a 34% rise in operating profit and a 17% increase in net income in the third quarter of 2025, despite a cautious market outlook and record cash reserves of $381.7 billion.

Time is just about up if you want the best deals on flights for Thanksgiving and Christmas, according to travel company Kayak, which uses search data to analyze trends. The booking “sweet spot for holiday savings” stretches from mid-October to early November, the company says.\n \n\n   \n  Holiday travel set a record in the US last year, and it’s forecast to surpass 2024 levels. Aviation analytics firm Cirium told CNN that passenger bookings on major US airlines for Thanksgiving are up 2.2 percent from last year.\n \n\n   \n  Reservations for Christmas week are up as well, but less than 1 percent, Cirium said.\n \n\n   \n  Hoping to avoid the crowds?  Kayak suggests  flying out for Thanksgiving on Monday, November 24. That day will be the cheapest. As for Christmas, the most affordable day to fly domestically or internationally will be Christmas Eve.\n \n\n   \n  A rush of passengers would be welcome news to America’s travel industry, which the U.S. Travel Association estimates has lost out on $1 billion in consumer spending every week of the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controller staffing shortages have already caused delays at facilities across the country during the monthlong shutdown, and it could get worse.\n \n\n   \n  Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches, Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy  warned on Thursday , after a roundtable at the White House with aviation, travel and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s going to lead to massive delays,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  At LaGuardia Airport in New York earlier this week, Duffy said safety would never be compromised, but staffing shortages often result in slower rates of departures and arrivals.\n \n\n   \n  “If we have issues, we will slow it down,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  AAA recommends travelers arrive at the airport extra early in case of TSA security line delays caused by potential staffing shortages.\n \n\n   \n    Still time to get spooked\n \n\n   \n  Halloween weekend’s not over yet, and some “spooky explorers” hunt for ghosts all year long.

CNN spent 24 hours on board .\n \n\n   \n  The aptly named Dolce Vita Orient Express, which was unveiled earlier this year, is Italy’s first homegrown luxury train. It’s meant to evoke the panache of post-war Italy as exemplified by the films of Federico Fellini, including,  chiaramente , the 1960 classic, “La Dolce Vita.”\n \n\n   \n  Travelers can choose among 18 itineraries. A single day on the train is a 24-hour fever dream of wood paneling, wine and pampering. And it all begins at Rome’s updated Ostiense station.\n \n\n   \n  While train travel is often the way to go in Europe, it continues to face obstacles in the US.  America’s fast train  — NextGen Acela — made its public debut on August 27, but the new trains are rarely able to reach their max speed of 160 miles per hour because of the tracks they’re riding on.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Welcome to Paradise’\n \n\n   \n  After Anesu Masube’s mother died shortly before Christmas in 2017, he rushed back to his native Zimbabwe from Washington, DC, and he expected it to be  the worst flight of his life .\n \n\n   \n  His last-minute booking saddled him with the middle seat, which is especially uncomfortable for someone like Masube, who’s 6-foot-3-inches tall.\n \n\n   \n  But he managed to get moved to an exit row where the woman beside him greeted him by saying with a smile, “Welcome to Paradise.”\n \n\n   \n    In case you missed it\n \n\n   \n   Are American tourists easily distinguishable from Canadians? \n \n\n   \n  Let  the debate  begin.\n \n\n   \n   A private phone number, secret opening times, and no interest in Michelin. \n \n\n   \n  Inside one of Tokyo’s  invite-only  restaurants.\n \n\n   \n   This new tech could save old languages from dying out \n \n\n   \n  It’s a  robot  that’s works like a talking Elmo   toy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/science/nasa-moon-lunar-lander-options","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:32:00-04:00","title":"Inside NASA’s scramble to find a backup moon plan — and the wild ideas companies are pitching","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NASA is scrambling to find a backup or faster path to the Artemis III moon landing mission, amid growing concerns over SpaceX’s Starship rocket delays and technical failures.

       9:32 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A suggestion made last week by acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy that SpaceX could be booted from the agency’s upcoming moon-landing plans has rocked the space industry.\n \n\n   \n  Now, behind the scenes, pitches for alternate paths to the lunar surface are quietly starting to take shape.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX currently has a $2.9 billion contract to prepare its gargantuan Starship rocket system to ferry astronauts to the moon’s surface as part of NASA’s Artemis III mission. However, citing delays in Starship’s development and competitive pressure from China, NASA asked SpaceX and Blue Origin — which holds a separate lunar lander contract with the space agency — to submit plans to expedite development of their respective spacecraft by October 29.  Both companies have responded.\n \n\n   \n  But the space agency is also asking the broader commercial space industry to detail how they might get the job done more quickly, hinting that NASA leadership is prepared to sideline its current partners.\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke with half a dozen companies about how they plan to respond to NASA’s call to action, which the agency will formally issue once the government shutdown ends, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  While some of the potential proposals appear more straightforward than the current moon-landing plan that uses Starship, each involves constructing and testing new spacecraft designs, a process that typically takes at least six or seven years, noted Casey Drier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society.\n \n\n   \n  This could pose an issue for NASA’s timeline. China aims to land its astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030, and Duffy has repeatedly indicated he views beating China as a national security imperative.\n \n\n   \n  Artemis III is currently slated to happen as early as mid-2027, and NASA has signaled that the current pace of Starship development is threatening to push that target months or years into the future.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a certain part of the moon that everyone knows is the best,” Duffy said, referring to the moon’s largely unexplored south pole region — the target landing site for NASA’s Artemis III astronauts.\n \n\n   \n  “We have ice there. We have sunlight there. We want to get there first and claim that for America,” he said in  August .\n \n\n   \n  Experts who spoke with CNN for this article said that reevaluating SpaceX’s lunar lander contract could be wise. Spending years to develop an entirely new spacecraft could still potentially be faster, some argued, than waiting for Starship, which presents extremely difficult engineering challenges due to its sheer size and unprecedented design.\n \n\n   \n  Still, SpaceX has ticked a few boxes that might give it a significant leg up on the competition. Though in light of NASA’s broader lunar ambitions, experts say the real contest is about much more than speed.\n \n\n   \n    More power, more problems\n \n\n   \n  Touted as the most powerful rocket system ever built, Starship has launched on 11 eye-popping suborbital test flights, relighting engines in space, reusing boosters and demonstrating the ability to deploy satellites along the way.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted to its website on Thursday, SpaceX also said it has “completed 49 milestones tied to developing the subsystems, infrastructure, and operations needed to land astronauts on the Moon.” And the “vast majority” of its contractual testing milestones for NASA have happened on schedule, according to the company.\n \n\n   \n  NASA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on SpaceX’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  Starship has also faced significant setbacks — particularly this year. In the first six months of 2025, three prototype vehicles exploded during test flights and another burst into flames during routine ground testing, causing damage to SpaceX’s surrounding infrastructure in Texas. The hangups prompted national security hawks to voice worries that SpaceX won’t deliver Starship in time to realize NASA’s goals.\n \n\n   \n  Under the current plan, NASA would launch its astronauts aboard the Orion capsule atop the Space Launch System rocket, both of which NASA developed. After reaching lunar orbit, the astronauts would transfer to Starship, which would ferry two people down to the moon’s surface and then back to lunar orbit.\n \n\n   \n  But Starship is likely still a long way from being capable of carrying out such an endeavor.  So far, the company has only attempted to fly Starship on hour-long, suborbital test flights. It has not yet sent a vehicle to orbit on an operational mission, nor has it attempted to top off Starship’s fuel during a flight — a step that will be necessary for lunar missions because of Starship’s massive size and design.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how many refueling flights would need to be launched prior to Starship carrying out Artemis III. As CNN previously reported, the number could be  anywhere from 10 to 40 . And transferring cryogenic propellants, of the kind Starship relies on, has never been attempted before with any spacecraft.\n \n\n   \n  “SpaceX is not going to be able to make this work before 2030,” said Doug Loverro, a former chief of human spaceflight at NASA, expressing a sentiment recently  echoed  by two prior NASA administrators.\n \n\n   \n  The company did not provide details about its plan to expedite work on the NASA contract. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment from CNN, nor does the company typically answer questions from reporters.\n \n\n   \n    Retrofitting Blue Moon\n \n\n   \n  One alternative option that Duffy mentioned during a TV blitz last week is using a spacecraft built by Blue Origin. The Jeff Bezos-funded company already has a contract to provide lunar landers for use later in the Artemis program, including the Artemis V mission.\n \n\n   \n  And because Blue Origin already has an Artemis contract, it could be simpler for NASA to switch up the order in which it relies on its contractors rather than bringing a new company into the mix.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, Blue Origin is developing two models of its Blue Moon landers: Mark 1 for cargo, and Mark 2, the vehicle designed for humans and intended for use during Artemis V.\n \n\n   \n  But to expedite the creation of a lunar lander that could be used for the Artemis III mission, Blue Origin plans to propose a new design that leverages elements of both Mark 1 and Mark 2, according to an industry source familiar with the plan that hasn’t been made public.\n \n\n   \n  Then, to get the vehicle to the moon, Blue Origin would make use of one or more Mark 1 landers that have been essentially converted into small rocket stages that could boost a scaled-down version of Mark 2 out of Earth orbit and to its destination.\n \n\n   \n  The approach would require multiple launches, but likely fewer than the current plan with Starship, the source noted. Blue Origin’s plan also does not require the launch of refueling tankers or transferring super-chilled propellants between spacecraft in orbit.\n \n\n   \n    A team effort\n \n\n   \n  Lockheed Martin — which previously worked on Blue Origin’s lander design but is not actively part of a partnership — also intends to throw its hat in the ring.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, as a legacy NASA contractor, the company built the  $20.4 billion Orion spacecraft  that astronauts will ride when they take off from Earth.   Orion has already flown one successful mission around the moon — Artemis I — and is slated for a crewed test flight to lunar orbit as soon as February.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Lockheed says it can piece together a two-stage lunar lander that uses spare parts harvested from Orion.\n \n\n   \n  The company would make use of Space Shuttle-era OMS-E engines — which are also  used on Orion  — to serve as the propulsion for an “ascent stage” of the lunar lander, providing the thrust for the vehicle to lift off the moon after a mission is completed.\n \n\n   \n  But the vehicle also needs a descent stage to get down to the lunar surface in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  For that component, Lockheed plans to work with another commercial space outfit, though it has not yet decided which one, said Rob Chambers, Lockheed’s director of human spaceflight strategy, and Tim Cichan, the company’s chief architect of space exploration, during a video call last week.\n \n\n   \n  There are two paths Lockheed could take   for its descent stage that could determine which company it teams up with.   It could use a cryogenically fueled lunar lander similar to Blue Origin’s Mark 1. Or it could go with a vehicle that uses more stable propellants such as hypergolic fuels.\n \n\n   \n  If Lockheed decides to go with cryogenic fuels, which must be kept at super-cold temperatures, it would need to launch its ascent stage and descent stage on separate rockets and dock them in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  In that scenario, it may also need to launch additional “boost stages” to kick them out to the moon, Cichan said.\n \n\n   \n  If Lockheed opts for a descent stage with more stable fuels, however, the whole lander could launch in one piece. But it would need to be topped off with fuel in orbit, Cichan added.\n \n\n   \n  He noted  that the refueling process in that case would not, however, be as complex as attempting to refuel cryogenically powered spacecraft, such as Blue Origin’s lander or SpaceX’s Starship, in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  Transferring stable fuels between vehicles in orbit is a less risky proposition and has been taking place on the International Space Station since 2000, Cichan explained. “The Russians and Soviets have been doing it all the way back to the ‘70s,” Cichan said. “So that’s very known technology.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked what would make Lockheed’s proposal competitive with Blue Origin or SpaceX, Chamers said the company’s “approach is quickest because it leverages existing hardware, minimizes the required cadence of launches, and does not rely on technologies like cryogenic refueling or long duration storage that have never been performed on orbit.”\n \n\n   \n  Other commercial space companies contacted by CNN — including Firefly Aerospace and Northrop Grumman — said simply that they were “ready to support” NASA in its endeavor to find a faster way to complete the Artemis III mission.\n \n\n   \n  They did not confirm whether they would formally respond to the space agency’s anticipated request for   companies to submit proposals.\n \n\n   \n    Back to the drawing board\n \n\n   \n  Experts who spoke with CNN suggested that NASA should stretch its imagination when it comes to the spacecraft that will land astronauts on the moon.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody’s put together a true concept of design,” Loverro said.\n \n\n   \n  “All of that’s doable very quickly,” he noted, adding that he believes a new lander could go from concept to reality within five years.\n \n\n   \n  Loverro suggested that NASA should leverage in-house expertise by leaning on its own Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL, which he said should be empowered to rapidly pursue a lunar lander development program.\n \n\n   \n  While JPL couldn’t do the job alone, because the center is focused on robotic exploration and does not have human spaceflight experience, Loverro noted, the laboratory   has built a reputation over decades for its engineering precision and ability to pull off complex missions on unforgiving timelines.\n \n\n   \n  “You really want that that kind of program management leadership that JPL embodies so well,” Loverro said.\n \n\n   \n    Expensive red herrings\n \n\n   \n  One huge consideration with any of these proposals is the price.\n \n\n   \n  From NASA’s vantage point, SpaceX’s Starship is by far the cheapest proposal because the company is spending so much of its own money on the project. The company even  estimates  it is funding 90% of Starship’s production, test and launch facilities.\n \n\n   \n  None of the other companies CNN spoke with about alternative proposals for NASA’s lunar lander offered cost estimates for bringing their ideas to fruition.\n \n\n   \n  But as with any spaceflight project, it’s safe to assume they won’t be cheap.\n \n\n   \n  NASA’s funds are already limited. While Congress has been on board with supporting the Artemis program — adding $10 billion to bolster lunar efforts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — it’s not clear whether lawmakers would throw even more money at the project in an attempt to speed things up.\n \n\n   \n  The space agency also can’t easily cancel existing contracts with either SpaceX or Blue Origin.\n \n\n   \n  Drier noted, however, that support for the Artemis program does seem to be a stand-out unifying force for lawmakers. He also highlighted the fact that the current administration clearly views Artemis as a priority, allowing work on the program to continue  despite the ongoing government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  But considering the time and money space programs tend to consume, an attempt to hash out a new moon landing plan for Artemis III is an idea that “is probably three years too late to make a difference,” Drier added.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s only ever been one example of a successful human lunar lander in history: The contract for that was awarded in 1962, and it was first demonstrated on Apollo 9 in 1968,” Drier noted.\n \n\n   \n  “So that’s six years — and that cost about 30-ish billion dollars” for the lunar lander alone when adjusted for inflation, which is an exorbitant amount of money that exceeds the agency’s entire annual budget since the mid-1990s, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The space agency’s funding levels have remained far below the highs hit during the Apollo era in the decades since the program concluded.\n \n\n   \n  Another key consideration is time: It’s possible that pursuing one of these alternative options does successfully expedite the Artemis III mission. It’s also possible this pursuit will be an expensive red herring — sucking time and resources away from realizing the plan NASA has been working toward for years.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A base not a race’\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the flurry of conversations around rushing to cobble together a lunar lander, another discussion has been percolating — one that questions whether NASA should be trying to expedite Artemis III at all.\n \n\n   \n  Drier is among the experts who told CNN that they did not view simply landing on the moon before China as essential. The more important goal, they argue, is to pave the way for a permanent lunar base where astronauts can live and work.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX has appeared to support this viewpoint,  saying in its Thursday statement that Starship “will be a central enabler that will fulfill the vision of NASA’s Artemis program, which seeks to establish a lasting presence on the lunar surface, not just flags and footprints, and ultimately forge the path to land the first humans on Mars.”\n \n\n   \n  The company argues that is why Starship remains the best option for NASA’s Artemis program: The vehicle boasts a massive cargo bay and immense power that could be transformational — opening up possibilities once considered unthinkable, such as delivering 100 metric tons of cargo to the moon in one trip, according to SpaceX.\n \n\n   \n  In the public imagination, the new “space race” — as much as it really is a race — may be won or lost the moment the next astronaut sets foot on the moon. But perhaps the true winner will be the country that is able to build lasting infrastructure, experts say.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes great press fodder to frame this as competition,” said one space policy source, who was among several that spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss controversial issues. “But this is about the long game and the sustainability.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/europe/ukraine-pokrovsk-russia-fighting-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:12:00-04:00","title":"Fighting intensifies around key town in Ukraine amid fresh attacks on Russian energy","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Fighting is intensifying around the strategic town of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces claiming military gains.

intensifying, with the Russian Defense Ministry claiming to have eliminated a group of Ukrainian special forces sent to help defend the area.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks,  Russian  units have begun penetrating Pokrovsk itself and have closed in on the last resupply routes used to sustain Ukrainian forces in the town.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian special forces had landed in a helicopter on the northwestern outskirts of Pokrovsk, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Drone footage shared by an unofficial Russian Telegram channel showed Ukrainian soldiers fanning out from a Blackhawk helicopter. Eleven of the troops that had landed were killed, the Defense ministry claimed. It’s unclear when the mission took place.\n \n\n   \n  A source in Ukrainian intelligence told CNN that the claim was untrue. Stabilization efforts led by the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov continue in Pokrovsk, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian 7th Aerial Assault Corps also said there had been a successful landing in the Pokrovsk area. “It was a complex operation that required the synchronized actions of various units,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian units have managed to improve their tactical position in several districts of the city, according to the Corps. “We are increasing the number of assault groups in Pokrovsk,” it said, adding that 85 Russian soldiers had been killed in Pokrovsk over the past week.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian military’s commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that Pokrovsk and the neighboring town of Myrnohrad were “not surrounded or blocked, and we are doing everything we can to maintain logistics.”\n \n\n   \n  “A comprehensive operation to destroy and dislodge enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing,” Syrskyi said, adding that he had visited the area to coordinate its defense.\n \n\n   \n  Enemy units continued “to attempt to infiltrate residential areas and cut off our supply routes,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that its units “continue to destroy surrounded Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the area of the railway station” in Pokrovsk, and had repelled several attempts by Ukrainian forces to break out of the town. It added that the encirclement of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad was tightening.\n \n\n   \n  President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that about 200 Russian troops had infiltrated Pokrovsk. Geolocated video has shown Russian soldiers in the southern part of the town, moving in small groups.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian forces have tried to counter-attack, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, and had marginally advanced north of the town.\n \n\n   \n  Were Pokrovsk to fall, it would be the largest urban area to be taken by Russian forces since they seized Bakhmut in May 2023. The town is a junction for road and railway lines and occupying it would bring Russian forces closer to the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in the industrial belt of Donetsk.\n \n\n   \n  According to the unofficial Ukrainian DeepState website, which analyzes the battlefield, Russian forces gained 267 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in October — the same as in September.\n \n\n   \n  Efforts by the US President Donald Trump to get a ceasefire agreed in Ukraine have come to nothing, with the Kremlin insisting that the root causes of the conflict - including NATO’s expansion eastwards and what it has called the “Nazification” of Ukraine - must be addressed before there can be a truce.\n \n\n   \n  Moscow has said that the original goals of what it calls its Special Military Operation are non-negotiable: sovereignty over four eastern regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk.\n \n\n   \n    Pipelines blown up\n \n\n   \n  As Russian forces edge forward along several parts of the frontline, Ukraine have continued their long-range efforts to destroy and disrupt Russia’s energy and military infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Ukrainian saboteurs blew up up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to the country’s defense officials – the latest attack in a campaign by Kyiv to target refineries, pumping stations and pipelines.\n \n\n   \n  “The ‘Koltsevoy’ oil pipeline, which supplied the Russian occupation army,” was disabled on Friday in a special operation, according to a statement from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI).\n \n\n   \n  It published an image showing what appeared to be devices placed on three separate pipelines near Ramenskoye, south of Moscow, which were under anti-drone netting. Video published by DI showed an explosion that sent flames hundreds of meters into the air.\n \n\n   \n  “All three lines used by the aggressor to transport gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel were successfully and simultaneously blown up,” DI said.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many recent attacks using drones and missiles, the Ukrainians used a sabotage team to lay explosive devices at the site, according to the DI video.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been no word from the Russian authorities on the explosion nor on any disruption to fuel supplies. But the local authorities in the nearby district of Zhukovsky reported power cuts for some consumers on Friday without specifying the cause.\n \n\n   \n  The pipeline that forms a ring around Moscow is fed from several refineries. It is capable of pumping up to 3 million tons of aviation fuel, up to 2.8 million tons of diesel fuel, and up to 1.6 million tons of gasoline annually, according to DI.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine began  targeting  Russian energy infrastructure on a persistent basis in the summer, using longer-range drones and missiles to attack facilities deep inside Russian territory.\n \n\n   \n  “Our strikes have had more impact than the sanctions [against Russia]” said Budanov. “We have caused much greater damage to the Russian Federation through direct action than any economic levers of influence that have been introduced so far.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s President Zelensky said earlier this month that as much as  20%  of Russian refining capacity had been taken out of action, and several Russian regions have reported petrol shortages.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has imported more fuel from Belarus to compensate for the shortages.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/gaza-israel-isf-trump-plan-ceasefire-cnn","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":""},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/tariff-strategy-trump-canada-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s unusual tariff strategy puts America’s allies in a near-impossible situation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has escalated his use of tariffs as a political and diplomatic weapon, imposing increases on Canada (10%), India (50%), Brazil (50%), Colombia (unspecified), and South Africa, often for non-trade-related reasons such as political criticism or media content.

Trump’s unusual tariff strategy puts America’s allies in a near-impossible situation \n       \n  Analysis By Richard Quest, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has made it clear that his favorite method to gain leverage over opponent countries on the other side of a negotiating table is to  raise tariffs . It doesn’t matter whether the offense is trade-related or not.\n \n\n   \n  If there had been any lingering doubt (and I doubt there was), it was erased when Trump announced last week that he was  increasing tariffs  on Canada by 10% because he didn’t like an  anti-tariff commercial  Ontario aired across the United States. Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s TV ad quoted the late former President Ronald Reagan, who in 1987 criticized the use of general tariffs as a weapon of trade policy.\n \n\n   \n  It might seem obvious that there is no direct causal trade link between Ontario’s and, by extension Canada’s, action and Trump’s threat of raising Canada’s tariffs by 10%. Nevertheless, Trump’s response was hardly a surprise.\n \n\n   \n  The Canadian incident shows countries on the other side of the negotiating table with the United States face a near-impossible situation.\n \n\n   \n  First, they must negotiate trade deals by coming to Washington with a transactional mindset: “What can we offer up?”\n \n\n   \n  Second, they must, at the last minute, be prepared for the US president to want more — so they better have something else up their sleeve they can give as an offering.\n \n\n   \n  And there’s a third wrinkle: Never mind reciprocal tariffs — the United States is in the business of retaliatory tariffs for seemingly unrelated issues. It means no country can know what decision, policy or indiscretion will offend Trump, who may retaliate at virtually any time with further tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  This is uncharted territory, and it is not the normal way of doing business. Traditionally, tariffs have been used to correct a perceived trade imbalance and to protect the home market by making imports more expensive.\n \n\n   \n  What seems clear is that Trump’s love of tariffs will ensure they remain at the heart of US economic policy. I see no scenario in which the president, even after having negotiated a trade deal, doesn’t reserve to himself the right unilaterally to change his mind, threaten and then launch a fresh tariff.\n \n\n   \n  Some of Trump’s tariffs contain at least a scintilla of geo-political logic. For example, his decision to punish India with 50% tariffs came because the country is still buying oil from Russia. One could – just about – argue the tariff was supporting some wider, strategic goal in halting the Russia-Ukraine war.\n \n\n   \n  With others, it remains difficult or impossible to understand the trade purpose of tariffs. Take Brazil’s case: Trump thinks it’s wrong to prosecute the former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for allegedly plotting to overturn an election. Describing the prosecution as “a witch hunt that should end immediately,” Trump raised the tariff to 50% due “in part to Brazil’s insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans.” (The previous tariff had been around 10%.)\n \n\n   \n  According to the Brazilian Specialty Coffee Association, exports of special coffees are now down 70% and the IMF is warning of a more general slowdown in Brazil’s economy because of the tariffs.  The tariff weapon has hit its mark.\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s Colombia. After Colombian President Gustavo Petro criticized Trump’s bombings of alleged drug smugglers off the Caribbean coast, Trump called Petro “an illegal drug leader” who is “low rated” and very unpopular. The punishment: cutting off foreign aid and an unspecified increase in tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  For a country where democracy is often fragile at best, the economic disruption from increased tariffs could have devastating political effects.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also imposed steep tariffs on South Africa for its perceived ill treatment of White farmers and land reforms.\n \n\n   \n  The list goes on. Last week’s threat against Canada only confirmed the trend.\n \n\n   \n  After the last few weeks and months, countries have been warned. No one should be surprised if and when the weapon is fired.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the only country that has stood up to Trump and won is China. Xi Jinping has mastered the careful art of letting Trump appear to win while quietly claiming victory at home.  Xi played his hand perfectly  and came away from their meeting this past week with a reduction in tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s one final wrinkle: The US Supreme Court next week will hear Trump’s appeal of two lower court rulings that found his use of tariffs as leverage to be an illegal use of his emergency powers. If the Supreme Court upholds those rulings, Trump’s favorite tool could be significantly blunted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/michigan-church-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:49:00-04:00","title":"FBI Says Shooter in Deadly Michigan Church Attack Was Motivated by Hatred Toward the Mormon Faith","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A former Marine, Thomas Jacob Sanford, opened fire at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, on September 28, 2025, killing four people and injuring nine, before being killed by law enforcement.

motivated by hatred toward the Mormon faith \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:49 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  The former Marine who  opened fire in a Michigan church  and set it ablaze in September was motivated by “anti-religious beliefs” against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the FBI confirmed Friday.\n \n\n   \n  While  friends of the gunman  in the deadly shooting have said he harbored hatred for what is widely known as the Mormon church, the FBI had previously declined to specify the motivation behind the attack that left four people dead and the church burned to the ground, except to say it was a “targeted” act of violence.\n \n\n   \n  The gunman,  Thomas Jacob Sanford , 40, was killed by  law enforcement  responding to the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “I am confirming this is a targeted act of violence believed to be motivated by the assailant’s anti-religious beliefs against the Mormon religious community,” Jennifer Runyan, special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit field office, said in a prerecorded video message. The agency declined to share further information on what led to its conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Sanford drove his pickup truck into the side of a Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, 60 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, on Sunday, Sept. 28, and began shooting at congregants. Authorities have said he used gasoline as an accelerant to then light the church on fire.\n \n\n   \n   Body camera footage  released by Grand Blanc Township police shows an officer yelling, “Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop it now!” One of the officers tells another, “I’ve got your back, back here man. Yeah stay there. Shoot him!”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI said Friday that nine people were injured in the attack. The previous official count had been eight.\n \n\n   \n  “During our investigation, an additional individual was determined to be “injured” during the Grand Blanc critical incident,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The agency declined to comment Friday on the nature of the additional injury.\n \n\n   \n  The four people who were killed have been identified through family and friends as Craig Hayden, William “Pat” Howard, John Bond and Thelma Armstrong.\n \n\n   \n  Lisa Louis, who was in the chapel when her father, Hayden, was fatally shot, wrote in a letter that after looking into the shooter’s eyes, she  forgave him , “with my heart.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, top church leaders preached a  message of love and forgiveness  in the wake of the attack while gathered for the faith’s twice-annual general conference in its home state of Utah. Its members responded by raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in an  online fundraiser for the gunman’s family .\n \n\n   \n  The church said it strengthened its security protocols for the conference and, days later, for the  funeral of its oldest-ever president , who died a day before the Michigan shooting.\n \n\n   \n  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints did not have a comment Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Brandt Malone, a member of the faith who was attending services at a nearby church on the morning of the shooting, said the FBI’s statement “did confirm some of our darkest fears — that this attack was motivated by hatred.”\n \n\n   \n  “This affects all believers of all religious traditions, and it hurts that there are those out there who are motivated by the darkest of feelings,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Malone grew up attending events at the church where the attack occurred. He said local Latter-day Saints have been uplifted by an outpouring of love from the Grand Blanc Township community and other religious congregations.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have released little information about Sanford and the attack. People who knew him have said he began vocalizing anti-Mormon sentiments years ago after living in Utah, where he dated and broke up with a girlfriend who was a member of the faith. Sanford had moved to Utah after leaving the Marines and told his friends he had become addicted to methamphetamines.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney acting as a spokesperson for Sanford’s family did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/africa/tanzania-hassan-landslide-election-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:28:00-04:00","title":"Tanzania’s Hassan declared landslide winner in election marred by violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tanzania's electoral commission declared President Samia Suluhu Hassan the winner of the presidential election with 97.66% of the vote, despite violent protests that erupted after the vote, driven by opposition accusations of electoral fraud and suppression.

But the leader of one global powerhouse is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The US president flew out of South Korea Thursday, moments after his  landmark meeting  with his Chinese counterpart that appeared to  de-escalate the protracted trade conflict  between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  With Trump choosing to skip the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation – which groups together countries accounting for more than half of global trade – Xi stepped into the limelight by calling for unity, cooperation and proposing a global body to govern artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his absence, Trump’s protectionist trade policies and punishing global tariffs have loomed over the two-day event in the city of Gyeongju. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stood in for Trump during the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific signed the “Gyeongju Declaration,” which included commitments to cooperate on economic recovery and growth. The leaders also adopted an AI initiative and a framework to respond to demographic changes caused by low birth rates and aging populations.\n \n\n   \n  “The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum in his opening remarks Friday. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”\n \n\n   \n  “China’s door to openness will not close; it will only open wider,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year was on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.\n \n\n   \n  In their declaration, the leaders acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges,” and as su﻿ch they would “support efforts to ensure resilient supply chains” and “create new drivers of growth” through digital innovations, including AI.\n \n\n   \n  “We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “Only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee also sat down for talks with Xi, who is on a state visit to South Korea, in the first summit meeting between the two leaders. The two discussed ways to expand cooperation and advance denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean presidential office.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the talks, Lee said the relationship between Seoul and Beijing has “not completely recovered yet” and there was a need to “find the path for helping one another.” He looked forward to China playing a role in promoting peace on the peninsula, Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea called talk of denuclearization a “pipedream” that will never be realized. The country’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho accused South Korea of lacking “common sense” for refusing to acknowledge Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Among the high-profile meetings Xi had on the sidelines of APEC was with Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.\n \n\n   \n  Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  “I aim to maintain communication with you and therefore jointly promote the development of China-Japan relations along the right track,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi faced a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes. \n \n\n   \n  She told reporters after the meeting that China and Japan agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship.” But Takaichi said she also expressed concerns to Xi on sensitive issues including Chinese export controls on rare earths, China’s activity in the East China Sea, and the detention of Japanese nationals in China.\n \n\n   \n  “I also asked China to resume Japanese beef and seafood imports,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting appeared in stark contrast to the  warm camaraderie  showed by Takaichi and Trump in Tokyo just days before, when the two allies had embarked on a “new golden age” of relations. Takaichi and Trump demonstrated a close bond complete with smiles, fist pumps and jokes.\n \n\n   \n  For Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, meeting with Xi marked a “turning point” in their relationship, according to his office.\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier speech that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”\n \n\n   \n  Carney had been looking for a reset of Canada-China relations after years of worsening ties and  diplomatic rows . Trade negotiations with the US, Canada’s biggest trading partner, are at  a dead end , and Carney said at the APEC summit that he was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders “affirmed their commitment to renewing the relationship between their two countries in a pragmatic and constructive way” and discussed a framework “to deepen cooperation across a range of areas – from clean and conventional energy, to agriculture, manufacturing, climate change, and international finance,” the prime minister’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Carney also accepted an invitation to visit China and both leaders “directed their officials to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Carney said that he had apologized to Trump for a  political advertisement  that angered the President so much that he terminated trade talks with Canada.\n \n\n   \n  “I did apologize to the President,” Carney said when asked by a reporter about the issue on Saturday. “The President was offended by the ad. It’s not something I would have done… which is to put in place that advertisement, and so I apologized to him.”\n \n\n   \n  The ad was released last month by the government of Canada’s Ontario province and featured audio from  a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan  criticizing tariffs on foreign goods.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"07:19:00-04:00","title":"Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in over 150 years, devastated the Caribbean, with Jamaica experiencing the worst damage as a Category 5 storm.

\nUpdated: \n        7:19 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after  Hurricane Melissa  tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds have  already unleashed  widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa lashed Bermuda as a Category 1 storm overnight Thursday into Friday as the storm passed the islands, bringing quick-hitting bursts of strong wind and rain. The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical as it races south of Newfoundland into cooler Atlantic water.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the storm, authorities in Bermuda closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands across the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  At least 50 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.\n \n\n   \n  The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.\n \n\n   \n    Jamaica hardest hit\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica took the  heaviest battering . Melissa made landfall there as a  Category 5 storm , with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).\n \n\n   \n  “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit coastal town of Black River on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  People gathering around the Black River Bridge searched for water, food and news about their loved ones. The Jamaican Defense Forces have landed in the area by helicopter, but desperation is setting in for residents, Van Dam reported. Many are trying to leave the area with their personal items by car, motorbike or on foot.\n \n\n   \n  Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15 feet of storm surge from Hurricane Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.\n \n\n   \n  The heat and humidity are complicating recovery efforts. There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”\n \n\n   \n  “What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17 th  century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.\n \n\n   \n  But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.\n \n\n   \n  In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, education minister Dana Morris Dixon said in a Tuesday  statement .\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, more than 13,000 residents were still in shelters, while 72% of the island was without power,  Jamaican government officials  said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, minister for local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel pushing more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Schools around the capital Kingston on the eastern side of the island are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba\n \n\n   \n  Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday. The country sustained “extensive damage,” according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n \n\n   \n  This included flooding, mudslides, property destruction and infrastructure damage, particularly in Cuba’s eastern regions, where hundreds of rural communities were left isolated.\n \n\n   \n  As many as 140,000 people were cut off due to rising rivers as the storm passed, according to  the Red Cross . In the province of Santiago, at least 241 communities were cut off due to the storm, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were evacuated in Cuba as Melissa approached.\n \n\n   \n  Cuba’s foreign ministry said it is in touch with the US State Department to get clarity on how the United States would be willing to help with recovery.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio  announced  earlier Thursday that the US is “prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance” to the Cuban people – both directly and through local partners.\n \n\n   \n  The administration of President Donald Trump has historically taken a hard-line stance against the communist-ruled island. In June, the president signed a  memorandum  that the White House said would increase pressure on the Cuban government and support the long-running US economic embargo of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio said Thursday that US law includes exemptions that authorize private donations of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to Cuba, as well as disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío responded to the offer by  saying : “We have been in contact with the State Department and are awaiting clarification on how and in what way they are willing to assist.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuba is already receiving some aid from partners such as China and Venezuela, as well as the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n    High death toll in Haiti\n \n\n   \n  The highest death toll so far has been reported in Haiti, where the hurricane did not make direct landfall but caused significant damage and at least 30 deaths, Reuters said. Twenty of these fatalities, including 10 children, were due to flooding in Petit-Goâve, where a flooded river burst its banks.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    International efforts\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding. The British government also said it was chartering a limited number of flights to help British nationals leave Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the UK pledged an additional an additional 5 million pounds ($6.5 million).\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  on Tuesday showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/shutdown-congress-divided","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The problem is everybody wants to win: Congress bitterly deadlocked as shutdown pain skyrockets","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government is facing its longest shutdown in history due to a deep political deadlock between Republicans and Democrats, with President Donald Trump pushing for radical measures such as eliminating the Senate filibuster to force a resolution.

skyrockets \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown is on the verge of becoming the longest in US history — and lawmakers still have no idea how much longer it will go.\n \n\n   \n  In Washington, senators left town for the weekend deadlocked and more frustrated than ever, while  critical safety net programs  could soon lose federal funding for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits for the month of November. President Donald Trump said later Friday he’d instructed administration lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits, adding that if “given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  But he noted that even immediate guidance from the courts would result in delayed benefits for food stamp recipients — which could still only be  a partial and short-term fix . Tens of millions of Americans are still bracing for a crisis that will leave them without the government assistance they need to eat, heat their homes or take care of their kids while they work.\n \n\n   \n  And after a week abroad, Trump announced his return with a missive that threatens to further complicate the path out of the shutdown: calling for eliminating the Senate filibuster in a “nuclear” move that even his closest congressional allies worry would only do more damage in the long run.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, the problem is everybody wants to win,” GOP Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia, who has advocated for Trump to get more directly involved in negotiations to reopen the government, said of the standoff in the Senate. “And you’ve got a lot of people really hurting, and that really upsets me.”\n \n\n   \n  “I imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” fumed Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who has repeatedly bucked his party and sided with Republicans on the funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  Privately, lawmakers of both parties have acknowledged in recent days they need to find a way out of the shutdown in the next week or two or else face even more dire consequences, according to interviews with a half-dozen sources.\n \n\n   \n  And publicly, many are hopeful that the skyrocketing pressure on both Republicans and Democrats will force the two sides to find a deal.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s going to be a flood of phone calls from people saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, my health care is going to go up by that much?” Sen. Chris Coons, a centrist Democrat from Delaware, told CNN, referring to the spiking premiums that his party has made a central demand in the funding fight. But he said phone lines would, too, be lighting up for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “I also think Democrats are going to get a flood of calls from people saying, wait, wait a minute. My SNAP and WIC is going to be…? So I think there will be building pressure on both parties to find a path forward.”\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate and House GOP leaders are confident Democrats will cave shortly after the November 4 elections, several of the sources said. Many point to a flurry of talks with some centrist Democrats to end the shutdown, perhaps in exchange for a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that remain Democrats’ biggest demand in the funding fight, as well as a commitment to full-year spending bills.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope it frees people up to move forward with opening government,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Election Day on Tuesday, claiming Democrats would be more willing to yield when they’re not “concerned about turnout” in key races in Virginia and New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Yet several people close to Democratic leaders insist the party is unwilling to back down for a show vote. After more than 30 days of insisting on a clear commitment on the health care issue, many Democrats will be unswayed by unofficial commitments: They want to hear directly from Trump.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown has dragged on, even some Republicans have grown antsy as Johnson has kept the House out of session since September 19 and lawmakers have remained in their districts.\n \n\n   \n  “People ask, ‘Do you like being here in the district?’ Of course I do because I get to see all of my constituents,” GOP Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told reporters on Tuesday from Washington. “But I also would tell you that we are built to work here. We are all built to be here and doing our jobs and late nights and early mornings and trying to figure out a path forward. And so, it’s a little unusual.”\n \n\n   \n  Many House lawmakers concede they don’t know what will happen if the shutdown extends past November 21, the date of the House-passed government funding extension.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also pointed to Trump’s late-night call for nuking the filibuster, which injected fresh uncertainty into the situation and raised further questions about the role the president might play in resolving the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In a Friday statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that “if Democrats won’t do what’s best for the American people, the nuclear options will need to be invoked,” though she did not offer a specific timeline. Top GOP leaders, meanwhile, were quick to swat away the suggestion of weakening the custom, while maintaining that Trump and Republicans in Congress were united in ending the shutdown without ceding any ground to Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  That includes Trump’s resistance to any further meetings with Hill leaders, despite constant requests from Democratic senators.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, shot down GOP leaders’ offer earlier this month to guarantee a vote on the floor on ACA subsidies in exchange for Democratic votes to end the shutdown, quipping, “I’m not sure that Leader Thune is really the leader of the Senate.”\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have insisted that their stance remains unchanged, and that there won’t be any negotiations until Democrats cave and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “Let them open up the country, and we’ll meet,” Trump said Friday. “We’ll meet very quickly. But they have to open up the country.”\n \n\n   \n  But in the days before Trump returned to the US, aides had privately discussed options for enticing Democrats to give in, including agreeing to undo the administration’s recent mass firing of federal workers in exchange for reopening the government, two people familiar with the deliberations told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those conversations were preliminary and did not yield any final decisions, the people familiar cautioned, especially amid concerns that it would hand Democrats an opportunity to claim they won the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  Another suggestion discussed by GOP officials — that Trump invite Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House next week to try to broker an end to the impasse — was swiftly ruled out. One senior congressional GOP aide stressed that it was never a real option.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the behind-the-scenes activity offers a window into the increasing urgency to end the shutdown before more pain hits Americans across the country — and the lingering concern within the administration over which side will bear the brunt of the political fallout.\n \n\n   \n  In recent polling, more voters still blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown than they do Democrats. And while the expiration of food aid has pushed more Democrats to seek an end to the shutdown, it’s also worried a swath of Republicans who represent the millions of red-district voters reliant on SNAP — and are already under pressure over high prices, health care and other economic issues.\n \n\n   \n  “The question becomes, who politically gets the blame?” said one GOP adviser involved in the shutdown discussions. “If Republicans are really feeling the tide shifting on that one there may be a more political imperative to get this solved.”\n \n\n   \n  Within Trump’s orbit, aides and advisers are largely resigned to the shutdown blowing past the 35-day record set during his first term, three people close to the White House said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet they are still holding out some hope that the impasse won’t last much beyond Tuesday’s elections, believing Democrats are increasingly eager to find an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, insist it’s Trump who needs to offer them one.\n \n\n   \n  “We could end this at any moment, if we can get the right people in the room, and that includes the president. He spent an hour on this, as far as I could tell, in a month. An hour. How much time has he spent on his ballroom?” Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told reporters this week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/how-to-help-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00Z","title":"How to Help SNAP Recipients as the Shutdown Drags On","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the government shutdown delayed the distribution of SNAP benefits scheduled for November 1, 2025, millions of Americans at risk of food insecurity responded by organizing community-led initiatives.

Ramishah Maruf, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  More likely than not, someone in your community — whether  friend, family or neighbor  — uses   SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  As  millions of people could lose access to food assistance programs  during the government shutdown, many Americans are trying — in however small a way — to fill in the gaps for people at risk of being left behind.\n \n\n   \n   Two federal judges ruled that the Trump administration has to tap into emergency funds  to at least partially cover November food assistance. But the aid, which was scheduled to disperse on the first of the month, will still be delayed reaching recipients.\n \n\n   \n  Tee Tran, the owner of Vietnamese restaurant Monster Pho in Oakland, California, knows the struggle all too well. He was one of the thousands of Vietnamese boat people, eventually reaching California in 1989, where his mother worked five jobs and used SNAP benefits to keep food on the table. Now he’s decided to give away free meals to children receiving help through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and a discount for their parents.\n \n\n   \n  “When I see these kids going through this and not having food, it really makes me think of me,” Tran said. “I know how it’s like when you look up to your parents and they want to give you so much … but financially they can’t do it.”\n \n\n   \n  But even though people are pitching in as much as they can to help, there are few options for families that help as much as food stamps. \n \n\n   \n  “No food bank, no charitable organization, can fill the gap if November SNAP isn’t provided,” Stefanie Shuman, Food Bank For New York City’s communications director, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Check with local businesses\n \n\n   \n  Kevin Cassidy, the owner of a chain restaurant on Long Island called KC’s Pizza & Wings, made a heartfelt post on social media saying he would provide a free meal, no questions asked, to anyone presenting a SNAP/EBT card. He didn’t expect the flood of support.\n \n\n   \n  In two days, he said he got over $1,000 in donations and hundreds of messages from people around the country asking how they can help. Now, he’s planning on prepping pre-made meals, working with a local food bank and using community donations to give out gift cards to local grocers.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is struggling a bit, and when you help others it comes back tenfold. The only way to receive is to give,” Cassidy said.\n \n\n   \n  Tran, the owner of Monster Pho, said he has lost 30% of his business in the past six months because of tariffs, immigration restrictions and reduced spending from his customers. That’s why he’s offering free meals to children and a discount to their parents, to help as much as he can without going under.\n \n\n   \n    Donate to a food bank\n \n\n   \n  Food Banks say that cash donations are more helpful than giving food directly if people are able to do so, because they are able to buy a lot more food in bulk themselves. In New York City, for example, $1 can provide up to 5 meals at Food Bank For NYC.\n \n\n   \n  Many companies also match employee donations to organizations such as these, so check with your employer, as well.\n \n\n   \n  The money goes a long way, especially right now.  Food banks have already been feeling the strain  due to increased lines and higher prices of food.\n \n\n   \n    Grocery Buddies\n \n\n   \n  Other people are using online forums to act as “grocery buddies” for families at risk of losing benefits,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors post in these community groups that they are willing to be a “grocery buddy,” offering help to whoever needs. Then, the parties figure what that help will look like, whether that means shopping together, using gift cards or something else.\n \n\n   \n    Local food pantry and mutual aid groups\n \n\n   \n  For those donating physical food, food bank groups said the best options are non-perishables. Key items include proteins such as canned chicken, tuna and salmon, as well as beans and nut butters. Pastas and rice also have a long shelf life.\n \n\n   \n  Other items food banks and local groups tend to need are hygiene products, such as tampons, pads, diapers and wipes, which can eat away at peoples’ grocery budgets.\n \n\n   \n    Call your local representative\n \n\n   \n  Other advocates say an easy and free way to take action is to call your local representative as the government is still shut down.\n \n\n   \n  Some local and state governments have stepped up to attempt to fill the gap left by SNAP, though it’s still not enough to totally cover the amount of aid.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no face to hunger. It’s oftentimes, again, working families… (when) the wage has not kept pace with the cost of living,” Shuman said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby and Alisha Ebrahimji contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/judge-blocks-trump-citizenship-proof-voting-form","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00-04:00","title":"Federal judge rules Trump can’t require citizenship proof on federal voting form","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled that President Donald Trump lacks constitutional authority to require documentary proof of citizenship on federal voter registration forms, finding the move violates the separation of powers.

judge rules Trump can’t require citizenship proof on federal voting form \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:57 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled Friday.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, DC, sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the Trump administration over a March executive order to overhaul US elections.\n \n\n   \n  She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in US elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion.\n \n\n   \n  She further emphasized that on matters related to setting qualifications for voting and regulating federal election procedures, “the Constitution assigns no direct role to the President in either domain.”\n \n\n   \n  Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when  she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue. \n \n\n   \n  The ruling grants the plaintiffs a partial summary judgment that prohibits the proof-of-citizenship requirement from going into effect. It says the US Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin of the ACLU, one of the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling “a clear victory for our democracy. President Trump’s attempt to impose a documentary proof of citizenship requirement on the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional power grab.”\n \n\n   \n  A message seeking comment from the White House was not immediately returned.\n \n\n   \n  While a top priority for Republicans, attempts to implement documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voting have been fraught. The US House passed a citizenship mandate last spring that has stalled in the Senate, and several attempts to pass similar legislation in the states have proved equally difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Such requirements have created problems and confusion for voters when they have taken effect at the state level. It presents particular hurdles for married women who have changed their name, since they might need to show birth certificates and marriage certificates as well as state IDs. Those complications arose earlier this year when a proof-of-citizenship requirement took effect for the first time during local elections in New Hampshire.\n \n\n   \n  In Kansas, a proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in effect for three years created chaos before it was overturned in federal court. Some 30,000 otherwise eligible people were prevented from registering to vote.\n \n\n   \n  Voting by noncitizens also has been shown to be rare.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit brought by the DNC and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump’s order. That includes a requirement that all mailed ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Other lawsuits against Trump’s election executive order are ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  In early April, 19 Democratic state attorneys general asked a separate federal court to reject Trump’s executive order. Washington and Oregon, where virtually all voting is done with mailed ballots, followed with their own lawsuit against the order.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/china/china-sends-youngest-astronaut-to-space-station-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:03:00Z","title":"China sends its youngest astronaut and four black mice to ‘Heavenly Palace’ space station","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China launched the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft, carrying three astronauts, including Zhang Hongzhang and Wu Fei — the youngest members of China's astronaut corps — to its permanently inhabited Tiangong space station, marking a generational shift in crew selection.

Here’s what the trial revealed \n       \n  By Jason Kravarik, Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A trial to decide the  fate of the National Guard deployments  in Oregon concluded Friday, leaving Portland residents, Trump administration officials and hundreds of soldiers in limbo as they await the judge’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Karin Immergut presided over the three-day trial that featured a surprising revelation: National Guard troops were on the ground at Portland’s ICE facility earlier this month even after the judge ordered them not to show up.\n \n\n   \n  The trial also provided insight on what top federal and National Guard officials knew — and didn’t know — when President Donald Trump called for hundreds of troops to protect the ICE facility that has faced months of protests.\n \n\n   \n  As Oregon and California challenge the effort to send 400 soldiers from their states to the facility, federal attorneys argued during the trial it’s within Trump’s presidential authority to respond to the daily protests outside the facility that have subjected the building and its agents to what it described as coordinated violence.\n \n\n   \n  But state and city attorneys called the move “one of the most significant infringements” on Oregon’s sovereignty in the state’s history and argued the Trump administration is dramatically misrepresenting the situation and risking inflaming tensions.\n \n\n   \n  “The government cannot create the very emergency they propose to resolve,” Oregon attorney Scott Kennedy said.\n \n\n   \n  Troops have so far been barred from deploying due to two temporary restraining orders from Immergut: one blocking  troops from Oregon  and another blocking  troops from any state . The former order is temporarily on hold after  being appealed  to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n \n\n   \n  Plaintiffs are seeking a ban on deploying National Guard troops to Oregon. The judge, whom  Trump appointed  during his first term, is expected to file a decision by Sunday when the previous order expires. The decision is expected to draw a quick appeal from the losing side.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ admits soldiers were at ICE facility even after judge’s order\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced abruptly in a social media post last month that he would order Oregon National Guard troops to Portland, hurling his administration into a legal showdown with the state.\n \n\n   \n  As the case played out, Immergut issued an initial restraining order on October 4 blocking the deployment. But government attorneys admitted this week that Guard soldiers were already at the facility – and remained there for hours after her order.\n \n\n   \n  Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  The judge briefly pressed the Trump administration on whether the soldiers’ presence might have been in contempt of her order, questioning why the government would deploy those Guard members while knowing her ruling on the restraining order was imminent.\n \n\n   \n  “The government deployed that very night that I told you I would issue an opinion,” Immergut said. “Does that not seem in bad faith?”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think so,” Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton replied, adding that the Guard members were needed at the ICE building prior to the judge’s ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Immergut questioned why the Oregon National Guard members didn’t vacate the ICE facility for hours after her restraining order was issued, yet California troops were able to arrive in Oregon by the next day.\n \n\n   \n  “Doesn’t that seem odd?” she asked.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton told her the direction to comply with her order “went high up in the chain of command,” and a four-star general was involved. He argued it took time to implement the order. “There are steps that it has to go through.”\n \n\n   \n  “My clients were working to end the mission,” Hamilton said.\n \n\n   \n  The issue was tabled after Immergut suggested there could be a separate hearing on the potential order violation.\n \n\n   \n    ICE facility official was surprised by Guard deployment\n \n\n   \n  Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, one of those officials testified.\n \n\n   \n  A deputy regional director for the Federal Protective Service, identified in court by the initials R.C., said he and his boss, the FPS regional director, found out about the order on the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I was surprised,” R.C. said.\n \n\n   \n  “Your first thought was ‘What would I do with 200 National Guard men?’” asked Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, sir,” R.C. said, admitting he already had a large number of FPS and supporting agents staffing the ICE facility. Asked about  Trump’s claim  that Portland is “burning down,” the official said, “I do not agree with the statement that Portland is burning down.”\n \n\n   \n  A high-ranking official in the National Guard Bureau also testified that he had never been to Portland’s ICE facility – or been formally briefed on the conditions there – before he authorized the Guard deployment.\n \n\n   \n  Acting Major General Timothy Rieger said the only direct information he had regarding conditions on the ground in Portland were from the media and other anecdotal accounts.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t know if that (media) footage is from this year or prior years?” asked California attorney Barbara Horne-Petersdorf.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not know the veracity of that footage,” Rieger replied.\n \n\n   \n  Rieger said he was acting on the direction of an internal memo from the Secretary of Defense’s office that was corroborated by a Truth Social post from Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Is the facility ‘under siege’ or under control?\n \n\n   \n  Underpinning the arguments was a fundamental disagreement over how extreme the demonstrations have been – and whether local law enforcement is capable of handling criminal activity or violence when it occurs.\n \n\n   \n  Portland “is not war-ravaged, there is no rebellion, and the laws continue to be enforced every day,” Caroline Turco, an attorney for the city of Portland, said during opening statements.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, a simmering protest scene only ramped up after Trump ordered Guard troops to enter Portland in late September, state and city attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting there have been “sporadic and inexcusable crimes” along with peaceful protests, Oregon’s attorney Scott Kennedy called them “precisely the kinds of challenges” that existing law enforcement can and have handled.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration focused on a particularly chaotic night in June as they argued local law enforcement is unable to fully protect the facility.\n \n\n   \n  The tense June 14 protest resulted in a  riot declaration by Portland police , and drew a crowd that was “very active, high-energy and engaged in active criminal conduct,” said DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis, quoting a report from Oregon State Police Captain Cameron Bailey.\n \n\n   \n  During cross examination on Wednesday, Bailey admitted troopers—who were scheduled to provide mutual aid to Portland police—were not on scene before the protest began.\n \n\n   \n  There was “no immediate law enforcement intervention available at that time?” Davis asked. Bailey agreed, saying troopers were scheduled to start later in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  R.C, the high-ranking official with the Federal Protective Service, said demonstrators that night threw broken glass, rocks and debris at federal agents. There was also an attempt to “breach the facility,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers that night considered using deadly force if protesters entered the building, saying they may have to “go lethal,” according to R.C.\n \n\n   \n  “Protesters were putting chains on the door,” R.C. said. “It shows an attempt to lock the officers in and create a hazard for the team that was there.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that two FPS officers were injured from fireworks thrown at the building and an ICE employee required medical attention after being hit with an object.\n \n\n   \n  Davis also sought to establish that federal officers were getting little help from Portland police by outlining several incidents in which rocks were thrown at the ICE facility without any arrests. One report logged people “using slingshots to shoot cameras” at the ICE facility, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for Oregon and Portland maintain Trump’s lawyers are seizing on a small sample size of dates that ended in violence, instead of a vast majority of nights that remained peaceful.\n \n\n   \n  Portland Police Commander Franz Schoening testified that managing these demonstrations can become complicated because the city’s sanctuary laws limit how officers are able to interact with crowds outside the immigration facility.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not engage in immigration-related enforcement or participate in activities” that could be related to it, Schoening said. That includes clearing crowds in front of the ICE driveway, so the task was left to federal agents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers are also restricted from assisting federal agents if they have begun to deploy munitions like pepper balls and tear gas, Schoening said, citing a law passed in 2020 that limits Portland’s participation with agencies using such munitions.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Unpredictable’ use of force can create safety risks, police commander says\n \n\n   \n  The Portland police commander highlighted starkly different approaches between federal and local law enforcement in handling the protests, saying federal tactics sometimes contribute to the chaos.\n \n\n   \n  Portland police often have different interpretations of the level of threat outside the ICE facility, Schoening said, including on October 18, when federal agents used munitions on the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “We simply didn’t see that (as necessary),” Schoening said.\n \n\n   \n  That night, police witnessed a federal officer launching tear gas canisters that “skipped off of their driveway and went onto the roof of the ICE facility where other officers were standing.”\n \n\n   \n  That prompted those federal officers to deploy more munitions, he said. “Our officers were impacted by those munitions.”\n \n\n   \n  The commander said he was “startled” to see the amount of force often employed by federal agents, noting it was “disproportionate to the level of criminal conduct we are seeing down there.”\n \n\n   \n  The use of force against demonstrators has at times threatened the safety of nearby Portland officers, Schoening added. When federal agents use “indiscriminate force,” he said, including the “unpredictable” use of chemical crowd dispersal agents, local police do not get a warning.\n \n\n   \n  “Officers face safety risks themselves,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration, however, argues federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters that justifies a more forceful  response.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton said the protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence. “The agitators coordinate their activity, including their information-gathering techniques.”\n \n\n   \n  The government also dismissed the state’s claim that National Guard presence escalates the tensions on the ground, saying there is no substantive evidence that has occurred.\n \n\n   \n  “It is totally speculative that there will be inflamed tensions and that inflamed tensions would impact plaintiffs in any way,” Hamilton said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-strikes-pacific-drug-trafficking","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:35:00.000-04:00","title":"Pentagon shifts to Pacific strikes seeking stronger link between targets and US drug trafficking","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon has shifted its military strategy to conduct anti-drug strikes in the eastern Pacific Ocean, replacing previous operations in the Caribbean, due to stronger intelligence indicating that cocaine trafficking from Colombia and Mexico has a more direct link to the U.S. market than from Venezuela.

After the first boat strike in September, for example, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the vessel had likely been headed toward Trinidad and Tobago.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is also not known to be a major source of cocaine for the US market, but the Trump administration has been aggressively trying to link Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to the drug trade while accumulating a huge military presence near Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “At the direction of the President, the Department of War is taking the fight to the cartels and defending our Homeland from Designated Terrorist Organization’s illicit activities before their violence and poison reaches our shores – this includes all of our nation’s borders,” a Pentagon official told CNN. “The Department’s newly established counter-narcotics Joint Task Force is expanding efforts on both the East and West Coasts to counter illicit drug trafficking by narco-terrorists using maritime routes.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not provided Congress with evidence to back up its claims that the 15 vessels the military has struck since September in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 61 people, were ferrying drugs and carrying known drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  During a classified briefing on Capitol Hill this week, Pentagon officials also told lawmakers they do not know how to gauge success in the ongoing military campaign, according to a source familiar with the closed-door session.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t know whether there’s any data or metrics that would show (the strikes are) impeding the flow of drugs, whether there has been an increase in the price due to higher demand or lower supply, like there’s just no information,” the source said. “None of the briefers could say what they’re going to do when the traffickers change their tactics. None of them could say how they’re addressing air and land routes.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs said following the briefing on Thursday that administration officials confirmed that they do not necessarily know the individual identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it.\n \n\n   \n  “They said that they do not need to positively identify individuals on the vessel to do the strikes,” Jacobs said, adding that the administration did not want to detain or try survivors in court, “because they could not satisfy the evidentiary burden.” The US military briefly held and then repatriated two survivors of one of its strikes earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials also told lawmakers on Thursday that the strikes were targeting cocaine, not fentanyl.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump told a collection of senior military brass assembled during an  unusual event in Virginia last month  that the strikes were primarily targeting fentanyl transporting ships.\n \n\n   \n  “These boats, they’re stacked up with bags of white powder, that’s mostly fentanyl and other drugs too,” he said. “Every boat kills 25,000.”\n \n\n   \n  Fentanyl killed more than double the number of Americans than cocaine did in 2023, according to  US government data . By Trump’s math, the campaign against alleged drug boats thus far should prevent roughly 375,000 deaths, or slightly more than the total population of Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Jacobs said the briefers insisted that cocaine is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl but it was not a satisfactory answer for most of us.”\n \n\n   \n  “None of them could say what they’re doing for fentanyl,” said the source familiar with the briefing. “Fentanyl is the real problem here, and they’re actually not addressing fentanyl in any of these operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats and Republicans also want a better explanation of the legal justification for the strikes, but military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings. The legal counsel to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was supposed to brief lawmakers on Thursday but pulled out after it became clear that lawyers from the defense secretary’s office were given a “pass” at attending, sources told CNN. Without the lawyers there, Democrats said the briefers could not fully answer their questions about the legality of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t even show up with the lawyers,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts said after the briefing. “They canceled at the last minute.”\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth told reporters on Friday while traveling in Asia that he had engaged with Congress on a bipartisan basis about the strikes. But also on Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said.\n \n\n   \n  The letters requested the execute orders for the US military strikes on the boats, and the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that CNN has reported the administration is leaning on to legally justify the strikes. Some Republican senators were shown the OLC memo by administration officials during a briefing on Wednesday, infuriating Democrats who were not invited to the briefing and have still not seen document.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner called the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95310","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:03:00-04:00","title":"Gender Inequality Accelerates Japan's Rural Depopulation","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article explores how gender inequality in rural Japan is accelerating depopulation, with young women leaving their hometowns due to rigid traditional roles, limited employment opportunities, and expectations to marry and bear children.

inequality accelerates Japan's rural depopulation \n         By Anthony Kuhn \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 5:03 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. AKITA, Japan — Young men in traditional festival clothes balance heavy bamboo poles up to 40 feet high on their heads, hands, hips and shoulders. Crossbars on the poles carry dozens of candlelit paper lanterns. Part ritual, part festival and part competition,   kanto  is a centuries-old display of strength, skill and culture unique to Akita Prefecture, in northern Japan's Tohoku region. Traditionally, only men are allowed to touch the poles. Women play flutes and drums. Kanto practitioners believe that women cannot participate because, according to Japan's Shinto religion, women's blood from menstruation and childbirth is considered impure for the purpose of religious rituals. Some Japanese women accept Kanto's gender divisions as part of the culture, or simply refrain from criticizing them. College student Mayaka Ogawa, for example, says, \"We can't really argue against tradition and religious reasons.\" Kanto is emblematic of both Akita's cultural splendor and its conservative rural society. And Akita itself is emblematic of Japan's 21st century demographic challenges: It has the most aged   population  (39% were over age 65 in 2024), the lowest birth rate and the fastest declining population of Japan's 47 prefectures, according to government figures. Gender inequality is accelerating depopulation in rural areas like this. Rural women flee gender inequality A Japanese government  report  on inequality published in June found that 27% of young women want to leave their hometowns, compared to 15% of young men — and rigid gender roles in rural society are prompting young women to vote with their feet. The survey shows that most women move to the cities in search of better employment opportunities — but there's a gender angle to that, too. Widespread expectations that women will prioritize housework and childcare also diminish young women's educational prospects, motivating them to leave rural areas.  In rural communities, \"women are stuck in temporary or part-time jobs and only men get promoted. Women don't want to work in these places, so they move to Tokyo,\" says Chuo University sociologist Masahiro Yamada. The problem is persistent, he says, because \"middle-aged and older men in rural areas don't want to change the current situation of discrimination against women.\" While last month's selection of Sanae Takaichi as Japan's first female prime minister breaks an important glass ceiling, she advocates a conservative, traditional view of gender roles. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Japanese women's political empowerment ranks 125th out of 148 countries in the  World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Report  for 2025. A   study  last year found that 744 Japanese municipalities, or 43% of the total, mostly in rural areas, are at risk of disappearing because their proportion of women of childbearing age are expected to drop by half by mid-century. But the effects of depopulation in Japan are already impossible to miss. Hundreds of thousands of jobs go unfilled due to  labor shortages . Millions of homes stand  vacant  or abandoned. Making women's voices heard While the exodus of rural women continues, some women stay put or return to rural areas to try to improve them. Ren Yamamoto  wanted to make young rural women's voices heard. So the 26-year-old resident of Nirasaki, a city in Yamanashi Prefecture — home to Mount Fuji and some 80 miles west of Tokyo — taped 100 interviews with rural women and started her own YouTube  channel . Many of her interviewees told her \"when they go back to their hometowns, they're asked: 'when are you getting married? when are you going to have children?' and they're sick of being forced into such a role,\" she says. Japan's public broadcaster NHK  reported  on her project. Earlier this year, then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba invited her to  meet  with him. \"Policies to support women have been centered on childcare and marriage, without addressing the reasons why women leave rural areas,\" Yamamoto told Ishiba. \"Policymakers haven't faced the fact that women have their own choices to make. We feel like we're seen as baby-making machines.\" Ishiba told Yamamoto he was trying to improve the situation, but it was tough because local officials are overwhelmingly middle-aged men. The government searches for policy fixes Japan's government has pointed out that the issues of gender equality and falling birthrate are inseparably linked. Central and local authorities are trying various  policies  to address both issues. Some local governments, including  Tokyo's  and Akita's, serve as matchmakers to try to increase marriages and births. \"I hate that,\" exclaims Mayaka Ogawa, the Akita college student. \"It almost comes across as women can't do it for themselves.\" She adds: \"Women are starting to awaken to the fact that they don't really need to form a family in order to be fulfilled.\" On a recent weekend, a handful of mostly middle-aged women attended a lecture in Akita, where an \"assertiveness trainer\" coached them on how to convince husbands to help more with housework and childcare. A poster for the event shows drawings of smiling men ironing laundry and cradling children. \"Even though so many people across Japan are putting in so much effort [toward gender equality], we still find ourselves in a situation where progress is painfully slow,\" says Naoko Tani, director of the Akita Prefectural Central Gender Equality Center, which hosted the lecture. Gnawing unease and pessimism Some Akita women say they suffer from  moya moya , a vague, gnawing sense that things aren't right, but they can't put their finger on it. Taboos against challenging gender roles and male authority thicken the fog of  moya moya . Tani says she too once suffered from this confusion, but \"through learning about things from a gender perspective, there were moments when things suddenly clicked for me — when I thought, 'Ah, so this is what it's about.' And at those times, the realization moved me to tears.\" Others are just moved to leave and not look back. \"Akita is often called an isolated island on land,\" says high school student Yukina Oguma, whose family are hereditary managers of a Buddhist temple in Akita. She plans to go to college in another prefecture. Asked what she would do if she were told or expected to stay in Akita and take over the temple, she replies, \"I would run away.\" Some women are pessimistic about improving gender equality in Akita anytime soon. \"Let Akita be depopulated. There is no way of stopping it, honestly speaking,\" argues college student Miwa Sawano. \"They won't realize they have a problem until the women leave.\" Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report in Tokyo and Yamanashi and Akita Prefectures. \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   Japan has more elderly adults than any major nation, and it is losing nearly a million people a year. By mid-century, an estimated 750 towns and villages may vanish from the map. One of the surest indicators of a village's slide toward extinction is when young women start leaving. NPR's Anthony Kuhn explains. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in non-English language). ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Crowds cheer as young men balance bamboo poles up to 40-feet high with lanterns on their hands, heads, hips and shoulders. It's a centuries-old tradition unique to Japan's Akita Prefecture. Only men are allowed to touch the poles and be sashite, or pole carriers. The women play flutes and drums. One pole carrier is New Zealand college student, Raz Tripp (ph). He says Kanto is rooted in Japan's Shinto religion. RAZ TRIPP: The reason only men can be sashite is because the goddess resides in the pole, and she doesn't like being touched by women. She gets jealous. KUHN: Miwa Sawano (ph) is a college senior and former Kanto club member. She accepts Kanto's gender roles as part of Akita's traditional culture, but she objects to the club's drinking parties with local residents. MIWA SAWANO: (Through interpreter) Things like sexual harassment happen. Kanto performers wear shorts, and girls' legs get touched a lot by the local men. KUHN: Akita has the most aged population, the lowest birth rate and the fastest rate of population decline of Japan's 47 prefectures. A government report in June said that many women are leaving rural areas due to rigid gender roles there. Even more leave for better jobs, but Chuo University sociologist Masahiro Yamada says there's a gender angle to that too. MASAHIRO YAMADA: (Through interpreter) Middle-aged and older men in rural areas don't want to change the current situation of discrimination against women, where women are stuck in temporary or part-time jobs and only men get promoted. Women don't want to work in these places, so they move to Tokyo. KUHN: But some women stay in or return to their hometowns to try to improve them. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC) KUHN: I met one such person in Nirasaki, a small city of about 28,000 people, some 80 miles west of Tokyo in Yamanashi Prefecture. So it's about 1 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon, and this is the main street of Nirasaki. And there's a fair amount of traffic, but most of the storefronts and shops here are shuttered. Twenty-six-year-old Ren Yamamoto (ph) wanted to make young, rural women's voices heard. She taped a hundred interviews and posted them on YouTube. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Japanese). REN YAMAMOTO: (Through interpreter) Lots of them said that when they go back to their hometowns, they feel pressure because they're asked, when are you getting married? When are you going to have children? And they're sick of being forced into such a role. KUHN: Yamamoto put the issue of gender inequality and depopulation on the map. Public broadcaster NHK reported on her project. Later, then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba invited her to meet with him. Yamamoto told Ishiba that government policies are missing the mark. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) YAMAMOTO: (Through interpreter) Policies to support women have been centered on child care and marriage without addressing the reasons why women leave rural areas. Policymakers haven't faced the fact that women have their own choices to make. We feel like we're seen as baby-making machines. KUHN: Japanese women's political empowerment ranks 125th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Report for 2025. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUMS AND FLUTE PLAYING) KUHN: Back in Akita, kids try drumming as the Kanto performance wraps up. Many women are pessimistic about changing Akita's conservative traditional culture. Independent Akita journalist Miwako Miura (ph) says her local newspaper boss told her not to report on gender inequality. MIWAKO MIURA: (Through interpreter) The deeper you go into rural areas, the more people try to not talk about gender issues. People are afraid that if they say something that crosses the line, they'll be criticized. It's a taboo. KUHN: Some rural women complain of what they call in Japanese moyamoya (ph). It's a vague feeling that something is wrong, but you can't quite put your finger on it. Often, it's enough to make women leave the countryside. College senior Miwa Sawano says let them go. SAWANO: (Through interpreter) Let Akita be depopulated. There's no way of stopping it, honestly speaking. They won't realize they have a problem until the women leave. KUHN: Sawano adds that women should not have to suffer oppression in the name of preserving traditional culture.

population will make it even harder to care for elders \n         By Kristin Wright, Marisa Peñaloza \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Sunday \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON, D.C. — Maurice White, 75, and Renee DeVigne, 68, are among the millions of family caregivers in the U.S. whose lives center around caring for aging loved ones. The Washington, D.C. couple has gone to extraordinary lengths, into their own retirement years, to take care of family elders. They've cared for White's mother Evelyn White in their home for 25 years. The retired teacher turned 104 in October. She's one of the last of their elders they will care for. \"There have been 12,\" said DeVigne. \"His father, my mother, and other aunts, uncles, grandparents.\" The couple also helps care for DeVigne's dad, who lives in a memory care facility. While people are living longer, they're also having fewer children,  according to the United Nations . In the U.S., this population shift means caring for parents, grandparents, and other relatives could become even more challenging with fewer family members to pitch in. The caregiving industry is already experiencing a workforce shortage. The   decline in the birth rate  may reshape how we think about caring for the oldest Americans. Multigenerational living Maurice White and DeVigne say they know many families can't keep loved ones at home for various reasons. Some are juggling the demands of jobs and parenthood. White retired early — 20 years ago — and the couple doesn't have children. Some families may not have enough space in their homes. White built an apartment in their basement for his mother. He says their culture as a Black family plays an important role in their decision to provide care at home. \"I do think that African-American families have more of a tendency to do that, many because of money, but more just because of the family connection,\" he said. \"This is my mom. We put her to bed every night and say prayers with her.\" According to  Pew Research Center , about 26% of Black and Hispanic Americans, and 24% of Asian Americans lived in multigenerational households compared to 13% of white Americans in 2021. And the  Bureau of Labor Statistics  says from 2021-2022, 45% of Black elder care providers were taking care of a parent. For Hispanics or Latinos, that same figure was about half. Ai-jen Poo is Executive Director of Caring Across Generations and President of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. She says the U.S. is nearing a tipping point with families overwhelmed by caregiving demands. \"We've kind of taken this model of care where you're on your own and you're expected to shoulder and manage it as an individual or as families alone,\" she said. \"We've taken this model to its very limit and we're all at the edge of the cliff looking down and wondering what to do next.\" White and DeVigne took care of his mother Evelyn without assistance until she started needing more support a couple of years ago. Then, they hired home health aide Selisa Sutton. \"I'm like family. I call her my auntie,\" said Sutton, 52. Evelyn was out for mile-long walks. \"She was bathing herself, brushing her teeth, getting herself dressed, she'd ride her bike, we'd go to the senior citizen center everyday!\" But this summer, everything changed. Evelyn had a stroke. She was in the hospital for nine days and then started short-term rehab at Knollwood Life Plan Community, a senior living community in Washington, D.C. Workforce shortages and rising cost of care Knollwood is among many care facilities that have had to navigate the strain of workforce shortages. Beverly Morgan, a registered nurse and director of Sales and Marketing at the center says she's concerned about these shortages because it's projected to grow worse nationally. \"The shortage was an issue 10 years before the pandemic. Then, you had this horrific pandemic that took a large portion of people out of the system,\" she said. The Trump Administration's immigration policies are also expected to   deepen the strain .   Immigrants make up  more than a fourth of professional direct long-term care workers. The median cost of a home health aide for 40 hours a week was more than $68,000 a year in 2023, according to  KFF , an independent health policy research, polling and news organization headquartered in the D.C. area. The median annual price tag for a private bedroom in assisted living exceeded $64,000. Assisted living support at Knollwood starts at about $89,000 a year. Families typically must pay out-of-pocket or use long-term care insurance for both types of care. Congress has made cuts to Medicaid, as more than 700,000 aging adults, people with disabilities, and those with chronic conditions are   on waitlists  to receive Medicaid home and community-based care in dozens of states. \"If we're living an average of 20 years longer … we've got to re-imagine a system of care and a culture of caregiving,\" said Poo. Human connection is key  Maurice White and Renee DeVigne's advice for people who want to care for loved ones at home is to learn as much as possible about their elders' needs and resources.    \"Research, research, research,\" said White. \"You try to do your due diligence to gather your facts and learn and ask questions,\" said DeVigne. \"I try to surround myself with people who know more than I do.\" Over the years, the couple has done workshops on spirituality and self-care. They say they've also incorporated meditation and other techniques to promote mental and emotional well being. DeVigne says the family's prayers were answered. After weeks of rehab, Evelyn White returned home. \"We're proud of you, Mom, because you've worked very hard,\" said DeVigne. \"It's hard to do rehab in the best of times, but at 104, you're an inspiration to us all.\" Evelyn says she's grateful for her life, and all the care and love she gets from her son and daughter-in-law. They say, over all these years, she has passed down to them her philosophy on life. \"Being nice to everyone and being appreciative of the things that are done for you,\" said White. Since returning home, her family says she has gotten positive reports from her doctors. White is rebuilding some strength in physical and occupational therapy, and she's back at the senior center. The family is reflecting on their experience at Knollwood in the facility-care system. It has given them new perspective and made them think differently about the future. White and DeVigne say they're still figuring out what type of care and care setting they want for themselves. The one thing they know they need and want is human connection. \"I've always said I'd stay in my house until the day I died,\" said White. \"But it dawned on me, you can be isolated all the time. I think that's one of the things that's helped mom, she has never been isolated. We keep her going and it made a difference. It kept her alive!\" The couple's hope is that the country can solve the caregiving crisis and be ready for shifts in the population. They imagine a day when families can afford care, the professional workforce is valued with better wages, and elders get the care they deserve. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:   The caregiving industry is already struggling with a workforce shortage. Add to that, the fact that Americans are living longer and having fewer children. It's a population shift that means more people are growing into old age than people coming up behind them. In this report, NPR's Kristin Wright puts those two together - the decline in the birth rate and how that may reshape how we think about caring for the oldest Americans. KRISTIN WRIGHT, BYLINE: A retired school teacher sits in her black-and-white striped blazer and pearls, ready for a party in her honor. She smiles when you catch her eye. EVELYN G WHITE: My name is Evelyn G. White. WRIGHT: White is celebrating another birthday. She's 104 and grateful for her life and all the care and love she gets from her son, Maurice White, and his wife, Renee DeVigne. We ask if he's her only son. E WHITE: As far as I know. (LAUGHTER) WRIGHT: The couple has been caring for White at home for 25 years. They think she's one of the last of many they've cared for. RENEE DEVIGNE: There's been 12. MAURICE WHITE: There's my dad. DEVIGNE: You know, his father, my mother, other aunts, uncles, grandparents. WRIGHT: They took care of White on their own until just a couple of years ago when she started needing more support. The family began hiring home health aides and found Selisa Sutton. SELISA SUTTON: I'm like family. I call her my auntie. WRIGHT: Sutton says White was usually very active, going out for mile-long walks. SUTTON: She was bathing herself, brushing her teeth, getting herself dressed. She would ride her bike. We'd go to the senior citizens center every day. WRIGHT: But one day this summer, things changed. White had a stroke. She couldn't move her left side. She was in the hospital for nine days and then had to go to rehab at Knollwood senior living community in Washington, D.C., before she could go back home. Sutton still sings gospel music to her every day. SUTTON: (Singing) This is the day. This is the day that the Lord has made, that the Lord has made. WRIGHT: White is surrounded by Sutton and her family. She sits at a table in the dining room at Knollwood for the celebration. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WRIGHT: The room is decorated with balloons, the tables set with white and royal blue linens and pink flowers. Sunlight streams through the windows. Six women are being honored. They've made it to 100. White's family says she's passed down to them her philosophy on life. E WHITE: Being nice to everybody and being appreciative of the things that are done for you. WRIGHT: Being nice and appreciative - her son says that's the way he was raised. So he and his wife insisted that Mom, who was a widow, move in with them all those years ago. It took a while to convince her, but she quickly adjusted. M WHITE: She said to me, this is the best thing I've ever done in my whole life. I don't have to worry about the roof, the heating, the - nothing. And we were so relieved 'cause I was really worried that we had pushed her into something she didn't want. WRIGHT: They know many families can't keep loved ones home. The couple never had children of their own. They shuffled back and forth from house to house most days, tending to their elders while working and built an apartment in their basement for White. Maurice White says as a Black family, culture plays a role. M WHITE: I do think that African-American families have more of a tendency to do that - many because of money but more just because of the family connection. It's just this is my mom. We put her to bed every night and say prayers with her. WRIGHT: According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, about a quarter of Black, Asian and Hispanic-Americans - the term used by Pew - live in multigenerational households like theirs. Like so many, Maurice White and Renee DeVigne wish they had a senior-care blueprint. They're still learning how to care for White as she gets older. M WHITE: And it's a gradual process. I mean, every week or every month, something changes. Mom had been fixing her own food, and then it got to the point where it started to be an issue. WRIGHT: And now things are changing again since the stroke. Walking is harder than it used to be, and White will have to sleep in a hospital bed when she gets home from rehab. This is the couple's advice for people who want to care for their loved ones at home. M WHITE: Research, research, research. WRIGHT: White has long-term care insurance, but her family still had to shift some things around, like selling property to cover some of her care... DEVIGNE: You try to do your due diligence to gather your facts and learn and ask questions. WRIGHT: ...And finding people like Sutton who love caring for others. SUTTON: How you feel, Ms. White? E WHITE: Good. Feeling good. WRIGHT: Even with an experienced, dedicated caregiver who comes into their home, there are many hard days. The couple has taken workshops to help manage the stress and emotions. DeVigne shares this release technique. SUTTON: If you are driving in your car, you blast your radio or your music. You're screaming at the top of your lungs. You just scream. WRIGHT: Millions of families across the country are feeling the frustration too. The cost of care keeps rising, and cuts to Medicaid and yearslong state waiting lists for home and community-based care leave many with few options. And at this rate, population shifts will mean more older people and fewer caregivers. BEVERLY MORGAN: My concern is the nursing shortage. WRIGHT: Beverly Morgan is the head of marketing at Knollwood, where White went for stroke rehab. Morgan's been a registered nurse for 30 years. MORGAN: There's a physician shortage. There's a physical therapy - I mean, health care professionals are dwindling. WRIGHT: It got worse at the height of the pandemic, and the Trump administration's immigration policies are expected to put more strain on the care workforce. Immigrants make up almost a third of professional, direct, long-term care workers. Beverly Morgan wonders how older people will get the care they need in the future. MORGAN: I'm not so sure as a country how we're going to be able to meet those needs when the population of people are growing but the professionals that are going to be able to serve them are not. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: One, two, three... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. WRIGHT: At the party, the honorees get bouquets of pink roses, including Evelyn White. (SOUNDBITE OF PAPER CRINKLING) E WHITE: Thank you so much. WRIGHT: She says the celebration was moving. E WHITE: It was wonderful. I thought it was so nice. I'm blessed. WRIGHT: Blessed, she says. DeVigne says the family's prayers have been answered. After weeks of rehab, White's going home. DEVIGNE: We're proud of you, Mom, because you've worked very hard here. It's hard to do rehab in the best of times, but at 104, you're an inspiration to us all. E WHITE: Thank you. Ain't that nice? WRIGHT: Generations to come will make hard decisions about how to care for their elders. Some days, White's son, who's 75 and daughter-in-law, who's 68 - both retired - talk about who will take care of them and where. M WHITE: I've always said I'd stay in my house until the day I died. WRIGHT: The couple agrees they have more talking to do, but they do know they'll always need human connection. M WHITE: Then it dawned on me, but then you can kind of be isolated all the time. And I think that's one of the things that's helped Mom. She's never been isolated, and it made a difference. It kept her alive. WRIGHT: Maurice White and Renee DeVigne's hope is that the country can solve the caregiving crisis and be ready for shifts in the population so that families can afford care, professional workers are valued with better wages and aging family members get the care they deserve.

She skips doctor’s appointments and church to remain undetected. And if she is detained by immigration enforcement officials, her 13-year-old son is prepared with a list of people to call and his social security number memorized.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot be separated from my kids,” said the 30-year-old undocumented mother of four children who were born in the United States. “I just can’t risk it.” CNN agreed to only use Alejandra’s first name to protect her identity out of respect for her safety concerns due to her immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  The idea that her family might be ripped apart only crossed her mind recently, she said, when President Donald Trump’s nationwide  immigration crackdown  penetrated the humble, quiet Nebraska community she calls home.\n \n\n   \n  In June, a  meatpacking plant in Omaha  was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in what the agency described as the  largest worksite operation  in the state since the start of the Trump administration. Alejandra says several family friends and church acquaintances were among the dozens of people detained.\n \n\n   \n  As that event continues to generate aftershocks, a new ICE detention center, dubbed the  “Cornhusker Clink,”  is opening in western Nebraska soon and is expected to hold up to 300 adults, a spokesperson for Nebraska’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen told CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The facility will join other new ICE detention centers in Republican-led states, including “ Alligator Alcatraz ” in Florida, “Louisiana Lockup” or  “Camp 57”  in Louisiana, and “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana.\n \n\n   \n  These new ICE facilities “are significantly expanding detention space to house the worst of the worst illegal aliens,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN Wednesday. “We look forward to the opening of this new partnership with Nebraska very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s office has estimated the contract with DHS will bring around $14 million annually to the state. Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for the governor’s office described it as “the latest action undertaken by Gov. Pillen to stand with President Trump and protect Americans from criminal illegal aliens. The facility will not only serve Nebraska, but also other states in the region.”\n \n\n   \n  Sitting hundreds of miles away from the border, the opening of “Cornhusker Clink” may solidify Nebraska’s place in the national immigration debate. Unlike many states at the center of immigration enforcement operations, Nebraska is under full Republican control and its governor hasn’t shied away from the conversation.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen signed a  January executive order  expressing his support for federal immigration policy, ordered Nebraska National Guard deployments to Texas, and facilitated the  troops’ activation  ahead of recent ICE protests in his state. He also touted the alleged  arrest of a MS-13 “kingpin”  in Omaha this summer.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, immigration advocates, some state lawmakers and business leaders said it’s a contrast from the previously welcoming atmosphere they have worked to build in the state, especially to strengthen its economy.\n \n\n   \n    Nebraska’s immigrant workforce under threat\n \n\n   \n  Unlike other states, Nebraska is not often seen of as a haven for immigrants, but parts of the state are an enclave for Latinos, who have lived and worked in the Cornhusker state for many years in part due to the meat packing industry, immigration advocates and business leaders in the state say.\n \n\n   \n  Today, much of Nebraska’s Latino population is second, third, or even fourth generation. In rural towns like Schuyler, Lexington and Madison, which some call “Latino Pueblos,” some business owners and community leaders were initially drawn by jobs at meat-packing plants and stayed for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Now, immigration operations are threatening the stability of these small communities and industry operations in Nebraska, said John Hansen, president of the  Nebraska Farmers Union .\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an awful lot of folks that are just afraid to show up to work, afraid to be seen in public,” said Hansen, noting many farms and meatpacking plants are struggling to stay staffed.\n \n\n   \n  Nebraska’s meatpacking industry, which includes major processing facilities for JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield, depends on immigrant labor. Immigrants, many of whom are undocumented, represent about 53% of the state’s workforce, according to the  Migration Policy Institute .\n \n\n   \n  Immigration raids, rising deportation fears and political shifts have created “an atmosphere of fear and intimidation,” among workers, Hansen said, and some union members have privately expressed regret about voting for Trump, who won a majority of the state’s vote in the 2024 election, citing mass deportation and tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The state is experiencing a severe labor shortage, with only 70 available workers for every 100 open jobs as of August, according to data from the  US Chamber of Commerce .\n \n\n   \n  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly claimed  immigrants were taking jobs from Americans.  But in actuality, immigrants were  filling critical labor gaps,  economists say.\n \n\n   \n  While meat packing jobs initially built stable, middle-class lives, Hansen said, injuries like carpal tunnel surged as assembly lines became faster and more repetitive by the 1960s and 1970s, leading to an exodus of American workers. Then, immigrants filled the gap, shaping Nebraska’s farms, factories and towns for decades, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Immigrants, like Alejandra’s family who first migrated from Mexico to Iowa, as well as Latinos born in the US, have spent decades inside those plants, cutting, trimming, packing and processing meat that ends up on dinner tables across America.\n \n\n   \n  Ness Sandoval, a professor at Saint Louis University who studies inequality and Latino and immigrant demography, recalls growing up in Nebraska and his dad’s grueling job at a meatpacking plant.\n \n\n   \n  “He had no time or energy to go to any of my events or sports. He would make an effort when it was something meaningful, but he had to be in bed like at 8 o’clock,” Sandoval said. “It’s a very physical job on the body.”\n \n\n   \n  Injuries were once so routine Sandoval’s father was given an award for going a year without getting hurt. As the years passed, the repetitive work led him to suffer from shoulder injuries, arthritis and a later, he retired after breaking his shoulder in a fall, Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n  Although his father took pride in his work, he never wanted his son to follow the same path “because he understood how difficult that job was on the body,” Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n    Remote state prison transformed to hold immigrants\n \n\n   \n  The terracotta-colored building in McCook, Nebraska, soon to be referred as “Cornhusker Clink” was previously a state prison known as the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services’ Work Ethic Camp.\n \n\n   \n  With a focus on reintegrating low-risk offenders back into the community, the camp housed more than 180 inmates who often worked on-site at the facility’s kitchen or warehouse, according to a 2024  report.  Others filled road-crew jobs with the Nebraska Department of Transportation.\n \n\n   \n  The facility, opened since 2001, aimed to ease prison overcrowding “and make prison bed space available for violent offenders.” Decades later, the Nebraska prison system is still struggling to manage its current population, which is exceeding 140% of its design capacity, according to a  2024 report  by the state’s inspector general of the correctional system.\n \n\n   \n  Repurposing the facility in McCook is expected to further destabilize the prison system, said Mindy Chipman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska.\n \n\n   \n  “Transitioning a minimum-security facility that provides reentry services — services the Department of Corrections says are more needed than ever — into an immigration detention center removes support from Nebraskans and confines people, most of whom have no criminal record,” Chipman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Current prisoners will be discharged, placed on parole or transferred to other correctional facilities “by the time the facility is ready to house ICE detainees,” the governor’s office said in a  September news release .\n \n\n   \n  When the converted ICE detention center opens, state officials said, people with minor criminal records and nonviolent felonies will be eligible to be placed there but not those with felony convictions linked to acts of violence.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the governor’s office, the department of corrections and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s motive is not safety, according to Chipman, but rather to signal support for Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. The “Cornhusker Clink” is one of several new detention projects backed by the Trump administration’s $45 billion “ One Big Beautiful Bill ,” which would add 80,000 ICE beds nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the overcrowding, legal advocates in Nebraska said they worry the facility’s remote location could increase the likelihood of detainees experiencing civil rights violations, with many being far from family and attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  McCook is one of several small communities in southwestern Nebraska and sits somewhat close to Interstate 80, a major highway that travels east to Omaha – about four hours away – and west toward Denver – three hours away.\n \n\n   \n  There is no public bus from Omaha, the most populous city in the state, to McCook as well as to North Platte, a rural town about an hour north of it where most of the immigrants detained following the raid at the meatpacking plant in June were taken. All travel must be done by car, which could become tricky during the harsh Nebraska winters.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s easier to get to North Platte because it’s on I-80. McCook, you have to go further, and you are more in the middle of nowhere,” said Lina Traslaviña Stover, executive director of the Omaha-based nonprofit Heartland Workers Group, whose work involves advocating for migrants who are detained at immigration detention facilities in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “Isolation is part of the strategy,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Anne Wruth, an attorney with the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, who traveled west to meet with a detained client in North Platte, called the process a “logistical nightmare.”\n \n\n   \n  For lawmakers and advocates, who said they were surprised when plans for the ICE facility were announced, there are other pressing needs such as property taxes, labor shortage and affordable housing in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This was not something that went through us,” Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature whose district includes part of Omaha, said about state lawmakers and plans for the facility, noting the timeline was “extremely truncated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘And if anything happens, you go’\n \n\n   \n  Alejandra is realizing the state she and her parents have called home and instantly made them feel welcome – where many still say “please” and “thank you” – has started to turn against them, or at least some people.\n \n\n   \n  When the family first arrived in Nebraska, Alejandra excelled in school where she was surrounded by classmates from Thailand, Haiti, and El Salvador – a diversity fueled in part by the state’s refugee resettlement program, which welcomes the most refugees per capita compared to other US states despite Nebraska’s relatively small population of just over 2 million people, according to a  data analysis  from the Immigration Research Initiative, a non-profit, non-partisan think tank tracking immigrant data.\n \n\n   \n  “It was awesome. I saw so many different races and nationalities — I wasn’t the only one,” Alejandra said. “Compared to Iowa, I wasn’t highlighted as ‘she is not from here.’”\n \n\n   \n  Her parents, who are also undocumented, own a home and pay taxes. They’ve seen their children and grandchildren grow up and enjoyed taking them to the park or baseball games.\n \n\n   \n  With animosity toward immigrants on the rise in the US and Nebraska, Alejandra says her parents will soon leave the country as they plan to self-deport to Mexico in six months. They are afraid to be detained and worry the conditions at ICE facilities could jeopardize her mother’s fragile health.\n \n\n   \n  “They do not like living in fear,” Alejandra said.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not immune to that fear, and neither are her children. In recent weeks, Alejandra gave her 13-year-old son instructions on what to do if anything were to happen to her as they drove to the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  “’Mom, you stay in the car and I’ll go inside. I’ll get everything that we need. And if anything happens, you go, but you drive away,’” Alejandra recalled her son telling her. “I know who to call.”\n \n\n   \n  As she looks towards the future, Alejandra wonders what kind of future awaits her young sons, especially if the Nebraska she knows continues to transform and align with Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric. Like her parents, Alejandra says she may be forced to leave the state, and everything she knows, in exchange for a stable and happy life.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591456","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"In a fraught political moment, one woman finds comfort on her morning commute","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2008, during a politically charged period when California's Proposition 8 banned same-sex marriage, Kate Elsley, a nurse practitioner living in Redwood City, faced daily emotional distress walking past signs supporting the ban.

Every day, she would commute from her home in the city, first taking a train and then walking the rest of the way to her office. Most days, the trip wasn't noteworthy. But in 2008, Proposition 8 had just been announced. It was a ballot measure aimed to outlaw same-sex marriage in California and her commute now took her past sign after sign supporting the ban. \"It was very emotional for me to walk by businesses or people's homes that had signs supporting Prop 8 because I just would always think, 'Why do they hate me?'\" Elsley said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She found herself imagining what it would be like to confront the businesses and homeowners displaying Prop 8 signs. \"I would want to go up to the front door and just sort of present myself and say, 'This is my face. I'm gay and I love my soon-to-be wife. And why do you think it's not OK for us to have the same rights that you do?'\" But then, one cold morning, Elsley got off the train and saw an older man silently standing on the platform opposite her.

It just felt like such an unsafe time to love who I did, and feel like people were against us and actively campaigning to take away something that I knew was going to make me happy.\" Elsley and her wife have now been married for 17 years. But Elsley will never forget that cold morning in 2008. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"To this day, when someone talks about an act of kindness, I usually get tears in my eyes, and I wish that I could go back and meet that gentleman and say thank you.

They were planned years ago \n         By Kat Lonsdorf \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump's deployments of National Guard troops to U.S. cities have outraged his political rivals, tested legal precedents and led to nationwide protests. The courts are weighing in on their legality. But — if successful — they could also fulfill a long-running administration goal of employing America's military to aid in the mass deportation of immigrants without legal status, according to an NPR review of past comments from Trump and his allies. It's a  move that would stray significantly  from past federal use of the Guard, challenging laws that dictate how the U.S. military can be used domestically. And with the 2026 midterms looming, some experts worry Guard troops could even be used as a tool of systemic voter suppression and intimidation. Trump has sent troops into  four Democratic-led cities  and threatened to send them to several more, claiming they are needed to crack down on crime and protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments, and the White House's rhetoric around them, have  regularly conflated violent crime and illegal immigration  into a single crisis, blurring the lines around the role of the Guard and federal agents. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Taken one at a time, the deployments can seem random or fickle — Trump will often muse about sending troops into a city,  only to back track his comments  and focus on a different city days later. But the president and several others in his inner circle — most notably Stephen Miller,   a senior aide to Trump in his first term, and now Trump's  right hand man on immigration  — have long talked about using the National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration raids, despite U.S. laws broadly preventing the military from being used for domestic policing. To get around those laws, both Trump and Miller have talked about invoking the  Insurrection Act , which allows the president to deploy the military within the U.S. in certain situations. Legal experts, activists and watchdog groups worry the Trump administration could fundamentally change the way the military is used on U.S. soil, specifically raising concerns about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what armed troops on the streets could mean as voters cast ballots. Laying the groundwork Much of Trump's campaign ahead of the 2024 election was focused on drumming up anti-immigrant sentiment and pushing his plan for mass deportations. He vowed several times on the campaign trail that he would launch the  largest deportation operation  in American history. In his first term, Trump and his administration had similar ambitions, but  struggled to scale up infrastructure and manpower  needed to carry out the goal. In a  TIME Magazine interview  in April of 2024, then-candidate Trump was asked specifically if his plan included the use of the U.S. military. \"I can see myself using the National Guard and, if necessary, I'd have to go a step further. We have to do whatever we have to do to stop the problem we have,\" Trump responded. Using the National Guard for immigration enforcement is an idea that Miller had talked about publicly in the years before. In 2023, Miller appeared on the late right-wing activist  Charlie Kirk's podcast  to talk about how mass deportations under Trump's hopeful second term could work. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"In terms of personnel, you go to the red state governors, and you say, give us your National Guard. We will deputize them as immigration enforcement officers,\" Miller explained. \"The Alabama National Guard is going to arrest illegal aliens in Alabama, and the Virginia National Guard in Virginia.\" Miller doesn't specify how that would be legal — under U.S. law, the military can't be used for domestic policing unless authorized by the Constitution or Congress. For Democratic-run states that don't comply, Miller said, the federal government would simply send the National Guard from a nearby Republican-run state. The deployments In recent months, the Trump administration has deployed Guard troops to states against the wishes of their Democratic governors — including sending troops from Texas into Illinois. The administration said their purpose was to protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments are tied up in court challenges. Miles Taylor, former chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's first term, worked closely with Miller. He's since become a vocal critic of the president and his policies. Taylor says he's not surprised to see Miller's plan coming to fruition. \"Trump was deeply deferential to Stephen and I think you've seen that with a vastly more empowered Stephen Miller in a second term,\" says Taylor, an author and commentator. Taylor says that during Trump's first term, the president wasn't talking publicly about using the U.S. military for immigration enforcement, but it was something that was discussed behind closed doors. \"I can remember in meetings with him in the Oval Office, or on Air Force One, or at the border, him starting to bring up this idea of using the United States military to solve the problem,\" he says. It wasn't something that Trump just talked about. In 2017,  The Associated Press reported  on a memo it obtained from DHS, outlining a draft proposal to use the National Guard to round up unauthorized immigrants throughout the U.S. At the time, the White House denied it, saying there was no such plan. Taylor says there very much was — but it was also more than that. \"It was the invocation of the Insurrection Act to deputize the military to enforce domestic law to basically become a domestic police force,\" he says, noting that this particular idea was something that troubled him and several other staffers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It rocked us to our core,\" he says. Trump invoking the Insurrection Act would legally allow for the military to act as police on U.S. soil — to carry out immigration enforcement, but possibly other enforcement too, according to legal experts. NPR asked the White House about potential plans to deputize the Guard for law enforcement and to use the Insurrection Act, but it did not directly respond to those questions, instead criticizing Taylor and NPR. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson also referenced Trump's \"highly successful operations to drive down violent crime in American cities.\" Project 2025 The broader themes of these National Guard deployments are also embedded in  Project 2025 , a conservative action plan written by the Heritage Foundation after Trump's first term that's more than 900 pages long. Trump has incorporated many of its policies, and authors into his second administration. So much so that the report's architect, Russell Vought, is the head of the White House's Office of Management and Budget. Matt Dallek, a professor at The George Washington University who studies the American conservative movement, says that Project 2025 essentially opens the door for Trump's National Guard deployments — particularly to Democratic-led cities — without explicitly calling for them. \"The subtext of Project 2025 is to take any and all steps at the executive level to go into cities and states to enact the priority — which is to root out illegal immigration,\" Dallek says. The idea of bullying states and cities into following orders from the president is a key part of the text, says David Graham, a journalist for The Atlantic  who also wrote a book on the project . So is the use of the military. \"There is this idea in Project 2025, and among the authors, that the military is just an underused resource for policing immigration,\" Graham says, noting that often illegal immigration is presented as a national security problem. He says the report's authors believe that the U.S. has \"this huge, huge resource of armed people, and we're not doing anything with it, and we need to use it to secure the border.\" Beyond mass deportation In recent weeks, Trump has talked about  invoking the Insurrection Act often , especially in regard to deploying the National Guard. Earlier this month, he said that he was \"allowed\" to invoke it if the courts deny his deployments in places like Portland, Ore., or Chicago, where prosecutors and federal judges have questioned the need for troops on the ground. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump invoking the Insurrection Act to allow troops to help with immigration enforcement is also something that Stephen Miller has talked about. He  told the New York Times  back in 2023: \"President Trump will do whatever it takes.\" That possibility has both legal experts and immigration advocates worried, especially about the implications it could have for Americans at large. Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, an immigration rights advocacy group, says it has her worried about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what the presence of troops might mean for voters as they cast ballots. \"What I have said repeatedly is that the path to authoritarianism in this country is being built on the backs of immigrants. They will begin with immigrants. They will not end with immigrants,\" she says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5396897","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:45Z","title":"EU Launches Comprehensive AI Regulation Framework to Ensure Transparency and Accountability in AI Systems","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The European Union has finalized a comprehensive regulatory framework for artificial intelligence, aimed at ensuring that AI systems are transparent, fair, and respectful of fundamental rights.

So they add sound effects. And bright flashing lights. And then a blackout. It's honestly pretty convincing. \"The magic of the theater,\" says Tammy Holder, an artist in residence at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts, a theater in Fort Lauderdale. Holder is directing more than three dozen students from middle and high schools across South Florida in an adapted version of a musical that's new for student theater: the 2023 show  Once Upon a One More Time , a jukebox musical featuring the music of Britney Spears. Because this version of the show hasn't been released yet, there's no road map, no other school to copy or learn from, which means the glass slipper scene has to be created from scratch. The original Broadway version of  Once Upon a One More Time  only lasted about three months. But when a show flops — or has a short run in New York — it's not over. Many shows actually get a second, much larger, life when they get licensed for middle and high schools. In fact, four times as many people see live theater in schools, with student actors and performers, than see shows on Broadway. \"The secondary licensing world is so much bigger than Broadway,\" explains John Prignano, the director of education and development for Music Theatre International. The company holds licensing rights for Broadway shows and revamps them into junior versions to sell to schools. \"A show can then live on for years and years.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On Broadway,  The Addams Family  had mixed reviews and closed in 2011 after a year and a half. But schools loved it. By 2019,  it was the most popular high school musical in the country . Holder actually saw the original  Once Upon a One More Time  on Broadway and knew instantly it would make a great junior show for students. It had dancing, catchy pop music and themes about belonging and individuality that she knew would resonate with teenage performers. The story centers on Cinderella (Cindy), who wants to break out of her fairytale story and build her own happily ever after. She's deterred by her evil stepmom and stepsisters but has help from her feminist Fairy Godmother, who encourages her to break her glass slipper (hence that tricky, pivotal scene). There are some discoveries along the way, notably the fact that Prince Charming is the same prince in  everyone's  fairytale. In other words, he's essentially been cheating on Cindy with all of her friends (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, etc.). Cue the hit songs  Oops! ... I Did It Again  and  Womanizer . The size and makeup of the cast helped, too, Holder says: \"The show is like 25 girls and two boys. That's every theater program in the country.\" How to adapt a Broadway play for students Here's how it works: A junior version of a show typically costs a school a flat rate of about $700. In addition to getting the script and the score, schools receive a detailed guide to putting on the show, with directors notes and ideas for costumes, set design and lighting. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Turning a Broadway show into a student production means you have to shrink it down a lot, from more than two hours to about 60 minutes. Songs, scenes and subplots are cut, including those that might be controversial or not age appropriate. Songs with swear words have to go, or get a makeover: Spears' 2013 single  Work Bitch,  for example, gets changed to  Work It , a song the stepsisters sing to Cinderella. But in making all those cuts, the story still has to make sense. That's where the students in Fort Lauderdale come in. They are among a handful of schools and regional theaters that get to work out the bugs and make sure it can be performed successfully on a school stage. \"Talk about a theater kid's dream, getting ahold of something before anyone else can and putting it onstage,\" says Holder, who has worked with Music Theatre International to pilot several student productions. Holder and her students' job is essentially a logistical evaluation of the piece to figure out what stays, what goes and what just doesn't work. Is the length OK? Do the cuts make sense? Can they go from Cinderella's castle to the woods with no scene in between? They're about to find out. What Holder and these students learn and change will influence the final version of the show that will be available to schools across the country next year. Developing a cast of characters Because this version of the show has never been performed before, there is a lot of trial and error and problem-solving in the weeks leading up to opening night. And Holder ends up making a few big changes. The first is that nearly everyone in the cast gets a name. \"Rather than just say the students were 'in the ensemble,' we gave them all characters. So now you have a Tinkerbell, a pirate,\" Holder explains. \"Not just 'happy villagers' or 'fourth one from the right.' They're actually integral to telling the story. I'm always thinking, 'How can we include as many students in as many ways possible?'\" For Holder, another thing that didn't work was the role of the Fairy Godmother. In the shortened script, her character had been cut substantially. \"My first thought,\" she says, \"was 'What's up with the Fairy Godmother?' Her part is so small and she's literally the catalyst for all the change in the story.\" Holder decided to shine a little more light on that character by giving her a solo. Crafting the look and feel  When a show has been in circulation awhile — performed by many schools — there's lots of inspiration for sets and costumes. Take  The Addams Family,  for example. The show has been performed thousands of times now. Theater directors and cast members can surf YouTube and get tons of ideas. But Holder and her team must start from scratch. For help designing the costumes, they turned to local middle and high school students for ideas and used a local costume shop to make them. The sets were also made locally, designed and built by a theater tech class at Nova Southeastern University. In late May, at the final dress rehearsal, the students get to see what it's like to move and perform in their costumes — and to see how they look next to the colorful sets and props. \"My costume is shiny and blue and awesome,\" explains Prince Charming, otherwise known as Jay Hendrix, 17. He's wearing a blue sequined blazer with a bright yellow sash and a white ruffled collar. \"So it's this huge, deep purple maxi dress with, like, a lot — a lot! — of tulle on the sleeves,\" says Eden Gross, 14, who plays the Fairy Godmother. Those costumes and the sets will be photographed and included in the resource guide provided to schools when they buy this junior version next year. That means what they do in Fort Lauderdale will be duplicated — and perhaps set the standard — for schools and regional theaters for years to come. I can't get these songs out of my head Backstage at the final run-through, it's hard to escape the constant humming and singing of all the Britney Spears songs in the show — a constant, overlapping montage of  Circus,   ... Baby One More Time ,  Toxic  and, a personal favorite, the ballad  Everytime .   Before spending time with these students, we thought the Spears canon might appeal more to parents buying tickets than to students who hadn't even been born yet when these songs were on the radio. Wrong! \"We're such big fans,\" says Alanna Maurer, 18, who plays Esmerelda. \"Ever since I came out of the womb, I've been singing her songs,\" says Noa Anker, 15, who plays Cinderella. \"I had all the songs memorized on the first day of rehearsal,\" explains Chloe Catty, 14, who plays Rapunzel. \"She's a pop idol. She's an icon. She's a queen!\" says Daniel Zelfman, 13, who plays a prince. The energy backstage is exciting, but everyone also knows it's down to the wire. Tomorrow is opening night. That means this is the final opportunity to fix or change anything. Nerves are high. One of the performers is throwing up in the bathroom. But they work out the snags. They figure out the perfect combination of sound effects and lighting design for the scene where Cinderella decides to break out of her story and smashes her glass slipper. And when the curtain falls on the finale — a huge dance number with the entire cast that includes a medley of all the upbeat songs from the show — the students erupt in cheers from the stage. Things are really coming together. \"Y'all ... we've got a show!\" Holder yells from the audience. Beyond the show, student theater is a place of joy and belonging  On opening night, Holder gathers the cast in a circle backstage. The theater is packed, and parents, family and friends are buzzing with anticipation. The student performers hold hands and close their eyes. Tinkerbell's fairy wings are all smushed up against Fairy Godmother's humongous tulle sleeves. \"You are incredible,\" Holder tells them. \"You are the joy we need in this world.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Student theater, for Holder and so many others, is ultimately about believing in the power of imagination to build community and find your voice. \"It's not just about putting on costumes and doing a show; it's everything else around it,\" says Prignano from Music Theatre International, who will see this show in Florida a day after opening. \"Theater gives you confidence in who you are and what you can do in a way that other things don't,\" he says. \"The tools that you learn expands to everything in life.\" Holder agrees. \"Students are drawn to theater because it is a place of belonging and a place to be heard,\" she says. \"If the world could just put on a show!\" A hush falls over the theater as the spotlights illuminate the thick red curtain, and the narrator, played by Yair Gerges, takes his spot in the center. \"Places, everyone!\"   As the story unfolds, the cast all hit their marks. The costumes look incredible, the lights catching all those sequins and the glitter. Cinderella delivers when she shatters that glass shoe. The timing, the lights — it all works perfectly. There are a few hiccups: One cast member is out sick. An important prop is forgotten backstage. And there are a few microphone glitches. But all that is part of the charm of student theater. This show may not have worked on Broadway two years ago, but this shorter, revamped version, filled with emotion and energy from the teenage performers, gets a standing ovation for almost every song here in Fort Lauderdale. Weeks later, when the show finally wraps, the work shifts back to Music Theatre International, the company that owns the junior version. It will incorporate what these students learned and changed into the final junior version, set to be released to schools next year. If the crowd's response in Florida was any indication,  Once Upon a One More Time   Jr.  will have audiences across the country on their feet and dancing. This story was edited by Steve Drummond. \n         \n         Transcript \n         ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST:   Four times as many people see live theater in schools with student actors and performers than see shows on Broadway. So when a show flops or has a short run in New York, it's not over. But adapting a Broadway musical for teenagers is a special challenge, as I found out spending time backstage in Florida. Let's start on opening night. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Follow me now. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: I'm changing, I'm changing, I'm changing. NADWORNY: We're backstage at the Broward Center Performing Arts theater in Fort Lauderdale. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: Does anybody have eyeshadow? NADWORNY: Students from across south Florida are getting ready to perform. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: I can't believe the show is tonight. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Onstage, please. NADWORNY: It's a musical that's new to student theater. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"...BABY ONE MORE TIME\") NOA ANKER: (As Cinderella, singing) Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know? NADWORNY: Yep, you know that music. It's Britney Spears. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"...BABY ONE MORE TIME\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Show me how you want it to be. NADWORNY: These students are resuscitating the 2023 show that lasted just three months on Broadway. This version is \"Once Upon A One More Time Jr.,\" meant mostly for tweens and young teenagers. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As character) There's the charming girls, and Cinderella is nowhere to be found. NADWORNY: It's a pilot production. The students here are among the first in the country to perform it, to test it out. After the original show closed on Broadway, Music Theatre International got the licensing rights for students and reworked the script. When it's available, schools will pay a flat fee and get the junior script and score and a guide to putting it on. To see if it actually works onstage... TAMMY HOLDER: We're going to change to opening just a little bit, not a lot. NADWORNY: ...The company turned to a handful of schools and regional theaters, including this one in Florida. HOLDER: Quiet in the house, please. Quiet on the stage. This is sound check. NADWORNY: Tammy Holder is the theater director here... HOLDER: Sing nice and loud, (singing) oh, baby, baby. NADWORNY: ...And let me and producer Lauren Migaki sit in on rehearsals leading up to opening night. Now, not all Broadway shows can work for students. But \"Once Upon A One More Time\" has a lot of things going for it, especially the makeup of the cast. HOLDER: Because it's, like, 25 girls and two boys. It's every theater program in the country. NADWORNY: The catchy music helps. Plus, the plot has themes about belonging and individuality that really resonate with student performers. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #5: (As character) Once upon a time, there was a girl who wanted more. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) NADWORNY: The story centers on Cinderella, who wants to break out of her fairy-tale story and build her own happily ever after. ANKER: She definitely sort of fits in that princess persona. NADWORNY: Cinderella is played here by 15-year-old Noa Anker. ANKER: She's sort of a romantic. But she realizes that her prince is, like, a little bit unloyal. JAY HENDRIX: They discover that I'm actually all of the different princesses' princes. So I'm Cinderella's prince, Little Mermaid's prince, etc. NADWORNY: Jay Hendrix, 17, was cast as Prince Charming. HENDRIX: (As Prince Charming) Princes, we're just different. ANKER: (As Cinderella) That's all you have to say for yourself? HENDRIX: (As Prince Charming) Oops. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS!…I DID IT AGAIN\") HENDRIX: (As Prince Charming, singing) I think I did it again. NADWORNY: Yep, that's the 2000 megahit \"Oops!…I Did It Again.\" And how could you have a storyline with cheating and not use Britney's hit \"Womanizer\"? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WOMANIZER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Womanizer, woman womanizer. You're a womanizer. Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer. NADWORNY: We thought perhaps the Britney canon catered more to parents buying tickets, since most of the students in this performance weren't even born when these songs were on the radio. But we were wrong. Had you guys heard about Britney Spears before this musical? UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: Yes. NADWORNY: (Laughter). ALANA MAUER: I'm a huge Britney fan, for sure. Yeah. CHLOE CATTY: I had, like, all the songs memorized on the first day of rehearsal. DANIEL ZELFMAN: She's a pop idol. ANKER: Ever since I came out of the womb, I've been singing her songs. CATTY: (Laughter). NADWORNY: Those were students Alana Mauer (ph), Chloe Catty (ph), Daniel Zelfman (ph) and Noa Anker. The junior version is way shorter, so songs and scenes and subplots are cut, including some that might be controversial or not age appropriate. But the story still has to make sense onstage. HOLDER: Who missed the stairs for Prince Charming? NADWORNY: Which is something they're figuring out when we arrive at rehearsals a few days before opening night. HOLDER: All right. Today, we have a big challenge. She's supposed to break the glass slipper. NADWORNY: It's the pivotal scene where Cinderella decides to break out of her story and smashes the glass slipper, essentially a metaphor for this whole show. HOLDER: Pick up the shoe, and then just - so just pick it up like you're going to smack him with it. Pick it up. And then you say... HENDRIX: (As Prince Charming) What do you think you're doing? HOLDER: Shroom. (SOUNDBITE OF GLASS SHATTERING) NADWORNY: Obviously, broken glass on a stage is a no-go. HOLDER: Hey, Dan (ph), can that crash be even louder? DAN: Oh, yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF GLASS SHATTERING) HOLDER: Oh, I don't hate that. NADWORNY: So Noa and Jay work to time their movements onstage with the lights and the sound... HOLDER: Throw it down. NADWORNY: ...To make it look like Cinderella is smashing the shoe. ANKER: (As Cinderella, singing) I am stronger. HOLDER: Crash. (SOUNDBITE OF GLASS SHATTERING) HOLDER: Lights. Swing. Right here. Hold. Wow. OK. NADWORNY: The timing has to be perfect. HOLDER: Let's see what happens. I don't know what's going to happen. NADWORNY: Part of piloting the show means sets and costumes, too. A theater tech class at nearby Nova Southeastern University designed and built the sets. And then local middle and high school students... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Oh, that's cute. NADWORNY: ...Helped dream up what the costumes looked like. Those sets and costumes and tweaks they've made will be photographed and duplicated and perhaps set the standard for other schools and regional theaters for decades to come. EDEN GROSS: It's so glittery and sparkly. NADWORNY: At dress rehearsal, the night before opening, the students get to finally perform in those outfits. Here are students Eden Gross (ph) and Sienna Antone Mate Jiggins (ph). GROSS: I just love it. SIENNA ANTONE MATE JIGGINS: So it's this huge, like, deep purple maxi dress with, like, a lot of tulle on the sleeves. NADWORNY: It's down to the wire and nerves are high - one of the kids is throwing up in the bathroom - because the final rehearsal is the last chance to fix anything. HOLDER: Can we see the Little Mermaid? NADWORNY: Jenna Hubert (ph) twirls in her tight purple dress. HOLDER: Oh, look at you. Can you move and like... JENNA HUBERT: I can move. HOLDER: ...Not fall on the floor and everything? And it's... HUBERT: I can do that. HOLDER: OK. Y'all. We got a show. (CHEERING) NADWORNY: So by opening night, it's time to see if this thing is going to come together and work as a show that other schools across the country can perform. HENDRIX: Show day. NADWORNY: The producers from the licensing company, MTI, will be in the audience taking notes. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #6: (Harmonizing). YETYER GIRGIS: Got to stay calm. NADWORNY: Yetyer Girgis (ph) is gearing up to open the show as the narrator. GIRGIS: You got to lock in. The main thing is lock in. HOLDER: Stand up tall. NADWORNY: Holder gathers the cast in a circle backstage. HOLDER: Take a deep breath in. NADWORNY: They hold hands and close their eyes. Tinker Bell's fairy wings are all smooshed up against Rapunzel's hair extensions. HOLDER: Let it out in a big sigh. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: Ah. HOLDER: We have a story to tell. NADWORNY: Ultimately, tonight, and student theater in general, is about believing in the power of imagination to build community and find a voice. HOLDER: You know I'm a crier (laughter). There is such a light in each of you. And it puts beauty in the world, and it puts joy in the world. So when you get out there tonight, shine that light. NADWORNY: And they do shine. (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"ONCE UPON A ONE MORE TIME JR.\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #7: (As character) Read me a story. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #8: (As character) A fairy tale. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters) Fairy tale. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #9: A fairy tale. NADWORNY: The costumes look incredible and sequin-y and bright. The cast hits all their marks. Cinderella delivers. When she shatters that glass shoe, the timing, the lights, it's pretty convincing. (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"ONCE UPON A ONE MORE TIME JR.\") ANKER: (As Cinderella, singing) I am stronger. (SOUNDBITE OF GLASS SHATTERING LOUD) NADWORNY: Now, this show might not have gotten a long run on Broadway two years ago. But with the changes and the heart from the teenage performers... (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"ONCE UPON A ONE MORE TIME JR.\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Once upon a - give me a sign - once upon a... NADWORNY: ...The audience in Fort Lauderdale give nearly every song a standing ovation. (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"ONCE UPON A ONE MORE TIME JR.\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Once upon a one more... UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #10: (As character) Once upon a time. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) ...Time. (CHEERING) NADWORNY: After the show wrapped back in June, MTI has been incorporating what these students learned and changed into the final junior version. And that will be available for schools to perform starting next year. (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"ONCE UPON A ONE MORE TIME JR.\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) All eyes on me in the center of the ring just like a circus. When I crack that whip everybody going to trip just like a circus. Don't stand there watching me. Follow me, show me what you can do. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96296","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"01:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump Administration Faces Monday Deadline on Use of Contingency Funds for SNAP","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s administration faces a critical deadline on Monday, November 3, 2025, to determine whether it will fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) using contingency funds during the government shutdown.

The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation's social safety net — and it costs about $8 billion per month nationally. The situation leaves millions with uncertainty about how they will feed themselves. Benefits will be delayed in November regardless of the outcome of the court cases because many beneficiaries have their cards recharged early in the month and the process of loading cards can take a week or more in many states. Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions. Cities and nonprofits also filed a lawsuit. On Friday, judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts ruled separately that the administration must continue to pay for SNAP. They both gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the program partially or in full for November. The USDA has a $5 billion contingency fund for the program, but the Trump administration reversed an earlier agency plan to use that money to keep SNAP running. Democratic officials argue that the administration could also use a separate fund of about $23 billion. U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, said SNAP must be funded using at least contingency funds, and he asked for an update on progress by Monday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said all previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored. During the shutdown, the USDA has terminated existing waivers that exempted work requirements for older adults, veterans and others. In Boston, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled the suspension was unlawful and said USDA has to pay for SNAP. Talwani ordered the federal government to advise by Monday whether they will use emergency reserve funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the program using both contingency funds and additional available funds. Advocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills. The majority of states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the SNAP debit cards. To qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four's net income after certain expenses can't exceed the federal poverty line, which is about $32,000 per year. Last year, SNAP assisted nearly 42 million people, about two-thirds of whom were families with children. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590198","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"To Optimize Health, Sync Your Habits With Your Body Clock","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights how aligning daily routines with circadian rhythms — including sleep, food intake, and exercise — can improve metabolic health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

Here's how \n         By Allison Aubrey \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The return to \"standard time\" is better for our health according to sleep scientists, but the time change can be disruptive, and our bodies must also adjust to more hours of darkness as we head towards winter. The body is an exquisite time-keeping machine. And growing evidence shows that if you align your daily habits with  your circadian rhythms  — including when you sleep, eat, and exercise — you can help fend off chronic disease and optimize good health. Let's start with a quick primer: \"Your body is filled with clocks, explains  Emily Manoogian , a researcher and chronobiologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. In addition to the master clock in your brain, there are time-keeping mechanisms in every organ and in your cells. \"Every cell in your body that has DNA has a molecular clock that keeps its own time,\" she says. They're all part of your body's circadian system helping you stay in sync with the 24-hour cycle. But our bodies don't keep perfect time on their own. Every day, we stray a bit from the 24-hour cycle, and need a reset, explains Salk Institute researcher  Satchin Panda , author of  The Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy, and Transform Your Health from Morning to Midnight.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The master clock in your brain coordinates all the other clocks through a series of different cues,\" Manoogian explains, including external cues — such as light, food, and movement. And that's why the timing of our habits can play a pivotal role in keeping our clocks in sync. Light from the sun serves as the external cue to resynchronize the master clock. That's why it's helpful to open the blinds in the morning and spend time outdoors. And, it turns out, our first bite of food each day also works as an external cue to sync the clocks in our digestive system and throughout our bodies. \"Food is also a signal to reset the clocks, especially your gut,\" Manoogian says. \"That's one of the reasons why making sure you're eating at the right time relative to light is important.\" Eating is a cue to wake up your digestive and metabolic organs, which are primed to function best during the day. By nighttime, the metabolic system is ready for rest, too. \"When you're asleep, your body expects to fast. And so it shuts down the part of the system that captures glucose from the blood and stores it away,\" she explains. When people eat too close to bedtime or in the middle of the night, their metabolic organs aren't optimized to do their job. The misalignment can lead to poor blood sugar control. Her research shows that restricting the number of hours you eat during a day to about a 10 hour window, can lead to significant improvements in metabolic health. There's lots of evidence that eating out of sync with your circadian rhythms can increase the risk of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. Studies show that shift workers who work rotating, overnight  shifts have a higher risk  of developing these conditions due, in part, to the disruption of the natural rhythms. And when it comes to exercise, some people find they do best in the morning, others in the afternoon, says  Dr. Phyliss Zee , director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. But the science shows exercising late at night, just before bed can disrupt sleep. \"There's a peak time for almost every physiological process,\" Zee says. \"The timing of feeding, the time that you exercise, the physical activity, all of these help entrain the clocks in your body so that they're in sync,\" she says. If you eat dinner and go to bed around the same time most nights, your 'creature of habit' ways could pay off. \"The science shows that regularity is very important for the circadian system and for health,\" Zee says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And while each person is unique she says,  a general rule of thumb is to begin limiting exposure to light, food and heavy exercise starting a few hours before bedtime. But as scientists have learned more about the importance of keeping our biological clocks in sync, society has moved in the opposite direction. Manoogian points to advertisements for midnight food menus, and around the clock work and entertainment as examples of our 24/7 modern life. One way to push back is to track your daily habits. Michelle Pittsley, who lives in Vista, Calif., started using an app called  myCircadianClock  to log her eating and blood sugar. She says it helped her stick to a \"time-restricted eating\" window and helped her track her progress. The app was developed by Salk scientists as a research tool, and is used in Salk Institute studies. It's free to any adult who downloads it. The app provides guidance on when to sleep, eat, and exercise. (Note: if you sign up, you're sharing data with researchers.) When we have \"broken\" circadian rhythms, the risk for chronic disease rises, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, gut diseases and common cancers, say Panda and Manoogian. If you want to be more intentional about aligning your habits for better health, here are three strategies to try. 1. Drop the late night snack, and limit the hours you eat. People who restrict their eating to a ten hour window can reduce their risk of Type 2 diabetes, Manoogian says. She and Panda co-authored a study of 108 adults, average age 59, who had symptoms of metabolic disease. They found those who followed time-restricted eating saw a significant  reduction in their hemoglobin A1c  (which is a person's average glucose level over a few months), compared to participants who did not restrict their eating window. Participants were not asked to reduce calories, only to restrict the eating window for a period of three months. \"It was exciting to see that just the time restricted eating was able to reduce their risk for Type 2 diabetes by 60%,\" Manoogian says, because the reduction in blood sugar, if maintained, reduces the risk of the disease. Research also suggests that eating your biggest meal of the day in the afternoon, as opposed to later in the evening can be beneficial for those who want to lose weight. A study from Spain found  early eaters lost 25 percent more weight  than late eaters. Panda says when his mother gave up a late night snack that included tea with sugar and milk and an occasional snack, that one change led to a significant drop in her blood sugar levels. 2. Go to bed about the same time most nights  \"Keeping the same sleep schedule is optimal,\" Manoogian says. The consistency gives your body a chance to anticipate and keep internal clocks synchronized. During sleep,  waste is cleared out of our brains , and  memories are consolidated , and there's a pile of evidence to show rest is critical for our health. But don't beat yourself up when you have a late night out. And of course, there will be disruptions due to travel, work deadlines or weekend celebrations. \"Going off your circadian system is not like breaking an arm,\" Manoogian says. Think of the harms of erratic schedules akin to the way dripping water can erode stone. \"Little hits, time after time, can wear down the system,\" she says. And the result is you can feel slower and older. There are  lots of bedtime rituals  to foster a good night's sleep, including limiting light before bed and sleeping in darkness. Zee's research shows  even small amounts of light  while sleeping  can have adverse effects on cardiovascular and metabolic health. 3. Time exercise to your 'sweet spot,' but not too late at night    Whether you're a morning lark or a night owl can influence the ideal time for you to exercise, so this will vary from person to person, Zee says. \"The better time to exercise depends, in part, on what we call your chronotype,\" she says, which is a person's innate preference for timing of sleep or when they feel more alert and energetic. One way to estimate your tendency is with a  Morningness-Eveningness  questionnaire. \"If you're a morning person, then morning exercise can be beneficial,\" creating a consistent structure, Zee says, but people who grow more alert later in the day, may want to put it off until later. As people juggle competing obligations, exercise may be shoehorned into the time it fits on your calendar, even if it's not your body clock's preferred window. She says it's important to remember that exercise is beneficial, no matter what time you do it. But keep this in mind: \"Exercise is a stimulatory cue to tell your body you should be awake,\" Manoogian says, so it's not a surprise that  recent research  shows that exercise just before sleep can  disrupt sleep quality  . \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1188769974","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00.000Z","title":"Artificial Intelligence Advances: A Look at Innovation and Future Potential","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An article published on April 5, 2023, highlights the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly focusing on innovations driven by companies like Alibaba Cloud.

My favorite stories were filled with magic, adventure and possibility, like  Around the World in 80 Days . And I had all the time in the world to search for those tales at the library and school book fairs. As an adult, though, I get into reading ruts. I don't have as much time to dig around for books, and I'm not as sure of what I'll be into. Traci Thomas  loves recommending books to people like me who can't decide on what to read. She's the creator and host of the podcast  The Stacks , where she talks to guests about new titles (she recently interviewed former Georgia state representative Stacey Abrams about  her new romance novel ) and offers quirky book lists such as  short audiobooks to help you hit your reading goals  and  great books to re-read with your toddler . Thomas is confident that with a bit of soul-searching and a bit of luck, you  will  discover a book you'll enjoy and want to finish. \"There are so many books in the world, and there are books out there for you. Trust your gut,\" she says. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Interview highlights Go ahead, judge the book by its cover I am the queen of \"judge a book by its cover.\" The reason you can [do that] is because there is a lot of effort and marketing that goes into making covers that tell you what's in the book, what kind of person it's for and what to expect.  When you start to look at the books that you've loved in your life, you might notice some trends. When I look at my bookshelves, I have the most black books and the most red books, but I don't have a lot of green books. Whatever they're doing with the marketing for green books — not for me. I don't know if you should use a cover to pick a book 100% [of the time]. I have read books with gorgeous covers that I did not like. I have also read books that had embarrassing covers that I loved. But if you're at a bookstore and are trying to decide which of the three or four books to buy, pick what speaks to you and jumps out at you.  Just because Oprah liked it doesn't mean you will   People get into reading ruts because they try to read whatever they saw in  The New York Times  or Oprah's Book Club, even though it's not anything that they would normally want to read.  I encourage folks to trust what you like over trying to read with Oprah Winfrey because she's picking the books that  she  likes. Unless you have the exact same taste as Oprah, you might not agree that the book is great — and it might be difficult for you to get through it. Ditch the book if you find yourself scrolling through Instagram  You know if you don't like something. If you're falling asleep, checking your phone or rolling your eyes as you're reading the sentences, that might be a good sign that you don't like what you're reading.  So put the book down. Save yourself. There are too many books in the world to read. That is called \"cultivating taste.\" Zero in on what you like  You know what you're drawn to. Like, I know I want to see the \"Barbie\" movie. So what are some books [that take place during the time era when you might have been playing with Barbie]? What are some books that have hot pink covers?  Articulate what it is that you're looking for. Are you looking for something with a lot of plot? Something romantic? Something nonfiction about public schools? Do you want to read a novel? A play? A collection of poetry? Zero in on what you like. Pay attention to what's on display at your local bookstore Bookstores get to decide what they stock, so they're going to stock things they think will sell or will be interesting to their community.  [For that reason], I like to look and see what's on the tables at the front of the bookstore or what's facing out on the shelves, because there is usually something that's new and exciting to either the world at large or to the booksellers in that specific store.  Seek the wise counsel of a book 'magician'  Booksellers and librarians are book matchmakers and magicians. You can go into a bookstore or library and say, \"I'm in the mood for something that feels like a long drive on Christmas Eve.\" And they'll be like, \"Oh, here you go.\" They always come up with something.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. When I was a kid, I was a beast when it came to reading. I was gulping down books by the dozen. I think that's in part because of that BOOK IT! program where you'd get a free personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut when you read a certain number of books. But also, reading transported me to this other world filled with magic and adventure and possibility. Plus, I had a lot of free time. As an adult, I have lost some of that magic. I get into these reading ruts because my time is limited, and nobody's offering pizza. And also, I'm not sure what books I'll even like. TRACI THOMAS: OK, what kind of TV shows do you like? That's where I start. SEGARRA: That's Traci Thomas, reporting for duty. She's a creator and host of \"The Stacks,\" a podcast about books. And Traci is really good at recommending books based on questions like this. I told her I just watched a movie on Netflix called \"Uncharted\" with Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg. And they are in search of, you know, buried treasure from long ago. And there are other people who are trying to get to it first. It's a big, big adventure. THOMAS: OK. Would you want a story that's set in the past, or would you want a story that is set in the present or in the future? SEGARRA: What I liked about this was that it was set in the present, but they were looking for something from the past. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: She also asked how I want to feel when I'm reading - happy or maybe tense but only in a, you know, got to solve the mystery kind of way. I also told her that one of my favorite books as a kid was \"Around The World In Eighty Days\" by Jules Verne, another adventure tale. With that info, she came up with two intriguing book suggestions, which I will share at the end of this episode. But yeah, if you're looking for something to read, Traci's got so many tips for you. On this episode of LIFE KIT - how to find books that you will love. We talk about what questions to ask yourself, how to decide on a genre or category and whether you can, in fact, judge a book by its cover. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: What are you reading right now? THOMAS: Oh, that's a great question. So I am currently reading a book called \"Momfluenced.\" I'm doing that on audiobook. And then with my eyes, I am reading a book called \"The Death Of Public School\" by Cara Fitzpatrick. SEGARRA: Both of them sound like maybe nonfiction? THOMAS: Both of them are definitely nonfiction. I am a nonfiction girlie. SEGARRA: What do you love so much about nonfiction? THOMAS: I'm a skeptic. And so sometimes when I read fiction, I'm like, that would never happen in real life, and it takes me out of it. I have a hard time, like, suspending my disbelief. But when I read nonfiction, I'm like, this is real life. And I like to learn. And also, the writing style of nonfiction is often a little more straightforward. I think sometimes with fiction, you know, authors write with sort of flowery language, which I know lots of people love, but for me, it just can be distracting. SEGARRA: Totally. I want to know if you are someone, especially if you're someone who hasn't been reading that much lately or in - you're in a kind of a reading rut, how can you start to figure out what you actually want to read? THOMAS: I think you know, right? Don't you know? Like, for a movie, like, I know I want to see the \"Barbie\" movie. SEGARRA: Me too. THOMAS: I'm not sure if I'll like it or not, but I know, at least, that I want to give it a shot. And I just - I think that people feel like they have to finish books. And I think that that is not a helpful approach because I think there are so many books in the world, and there are books out there for you. And I think if you trust your gut a little bit more and you say, OK, I'm really interested in the \"Barbie\" movie, what are some books about the 1980s and 1990s, or what are some books that have hot pink covers - like, you know, like, just the things that you're drawn to. And I think once you find that, it's sort of easier to articulate what it is that you're looking for. Are you looking for something with a lot of plot? Are you looking for something that's romance? Are you looking for something that's nonfiction about public schools? Like, there's so many books once you start to zero in on what it is that you like. SEGARRA: Do you think it might be helpful to go to a bookstore and wander around? THOMAS: Yes. And talk to the booksellers or the librarians. I mean, booksellers and librarians are book matchmakers and sort of magicians. You can go in and say, I read this and this and this, and I loved those three, but I also read this other book that I hated, and I'm in the mood for something that feels like, you know, a long drive on Christmas Eve. And they'll be like, oh, here you go. And they always come up with something. SEGARRA: Yeah. It reminds me of when I go, occasionally, to a cocktail bar and I know exactly how to describe the type of drinks that I like. THOMAS: Yes. SEGARRA: Something either herbal and fresh or smoky, right? And, like, that's something that I have perfected over the years, like, just knowing... THOMAS: Yeah. SEGARRA: ...Getting a lot of the wrong cocktail and being like... THOMAS: Right, right. SEGARRA: ...This tastes medicinal or I'm - this is way too strong or whatever. So I wonder, yeah, are there ways to describe the kinds of book you might like that way? THOMAS: Yes. Yes, you can definitely describe books that way. I think there's sort of three ways to describe books - what it's about, what genre it is, and then also sort of how it makes you feel or what it feels like - you know, 'cause I don't always know what topic I want to read about. I'm usually like, oh, what's some great investigative journalism, or what's a book where someone takes their memoir and ties it into some research? And usually, by kind of coming together with what I'm in the mood for, not necessarily the exact topic, I can get some really great recommendations. SEGARRA: Right. So when you walk into a bookstore, do you have a strategy for how to figure out whether you will like a book that you pick up? THOMAS: I like to look and see what's on the tables in the front because that usually is something that's new and exciting to either the world at large or the booksellers in that specific store. Bookstores get to decide what they stock, so they're going to stock things that they think will sell or that they think are really good or interesting for their community. If the bookstore that I go into has books that face out on the shelves, I like to see which books they've sort of picked to face out. Definitely talk to the booksellers. I ask them what they're reading, what they're excited about, what they've heard good things about. And I'm also just kind of looking around to see what jumps out at me. And then I might read the jacket copy and see a little bit. I don't like to read a lot of the jacket copy because I do not like to know what I'm going into as much as possible. SEGARRA: Right. THOMAS: But if you're feeling like you're in a rut or you want to get into reading, I would recommend reading it a little bit more because you don't want to get a book and then be like, I'm not interested in this. SEGARRA: You mentioned before covers. How much can covers tell you about a book? THOMAS: I think so much. I am the queen of judge a book by its cover. I know I'm not supposed to say that. I have definitely read books that have gorgeous covers that I did not like the book, and I have also read books that had covers that I thought were embarrassing, that - like, embarrassing because they were bad - that I loved the book. So I don't think it's a surefire way. But I think when you start to look at the books that you've loved in your life or that you've read recently that you like, you might notice some trends. Like, for me, when I look at my bookshelves, I have the most black books and the most red books, but I don't have a lot of green books. Like, I think whatever they're doing with the marketing with the green books - not for me. But I think that the reason that you can judge a book by its cover is because there is a lot of effort and marketing that goes into making covers that tell you sort of what's in the book, what kind of person it's for, what to expect. I don't know if you should 100% use a cover to pick a book, but, you know, if you're down to the last three or four and you're like, I don't know which one, which one, you know, sort of speaks to you and jumps out to you? SEGARRA: Yeah. I feel like there are a lot of categories you could consider in books as well. So there's obviously prose, and then there's poetry. There are plays, graphic novels, workbooks. Do you think these are helpful distinctions to start with - like, what kind of book am I looking for? THOMAS: I think so, yes. I think most people have a sense - you know, a broad sense. Like, do I want to read a novel? Do I want to read a play? Do I want to read a collection of poetry? I definitely think if you know for sure you don't like poetry, then no point browsing the poetry section, though I would challenge people to try to read poetry. I am in my trying-to-read-poetry phase and it's a really great, exciting challenge, even though I don't always get it. And I'm told that that's fine, too. So... SEGARRA: It's just such a big category to write it off completely. THOMAS: Totally, totally. I mean, that's - I used to be a I don't read poetry, and then a poet challenged me to read more poetry. So I said, I'm going to read a poem a day for a year. And I did it, and now I read poetry. Poems are a great way to get out of a reading rut, too. SEGARRA: Yeah. So let's say you do want to venture out of what you typically read. We can use the example of nonfiction and fiction. THOMAS: OK. SEGARRA: You're a nonfiction fan. But if you wanted to try to read a fiction book, would you look for something that had, I don't know, similar qualities to some of your favorite nonfiction? THOMAS: Yes. Yes. SEGARRA: Like, how would you think about that? THOMAS: So I know, for me, that I like fiction that is based in reality. I am not super into sci-fi fantasy, so I'm going to stay most likely away from that unless a book comes highly recommended. But we'll pretend like I'm just going in browsing. So I would ask someone or I would look around for a book that is in, like, maybe literary fiction or general fiction. And so - as opposed to genre fiction, which is, like, thriller, mystery, horror, romance. They call that genre fiction, and then general fiction is sort of more realistic, everyday life. This would be where I'd probably read the jacket copy. I would probably read a few sentences to get a sense for what the book is about. And then if I grab a handful, I might go ask the bookseller, like, hey, which of these feels like, you know, real life? Which of these feels sort of like clear narrative? I like plot, so I'd ask, you know, do you know if this book has plot? And I say I like plot because some people really like character development, where not a lot happens in the book, but you sort of sit with a character for hundreds of pages and sort of their thoughts and their musings. So for me personally, I'm a plot person, so I would ask about that. And also, the other thing is if there's no bookseller available to you, if you have your phone on you, you can always Google and just see what the book's about, or maybe see if you can find a review and read a few sentences of that as well. We're in, you know, the information age, so might as well take advantage of that. SEGARRA: There's another element here, too, which is, like, what kind of mood are you going for when you're reading, right? Like, if you're feeling really down, are you one of those people who wants to listen to sad music and lean into it? THOMAS: Right. (Laughter) Right. SEGARRA: Or are you going to put on a happy song and try to change the vibe? It feels like it's about knowing yourself, right? Does it work the same with reading? THOMAS: Yeah, for sure. That's such a good point, because sometimes - and sometimes you want to put on the sad music. And then sometimes you want to put on the happy music. So, like, you really have to figure out what you want. Another piece of advice kind of along those lines is that - I know so many people who get in reading ruts because they try to read whatever they saw in the New York Times or on Oprah's Book Club or whatever, even though it's not anything that they would normally want to read. I encourage folks to trust what you like over trying to read with Oprah Winfrey, because she's picking the books that she likes. SEGARRA: And, I mean, there's also, like - it's OK to like books that other people say are corny... THOMAS: Yes. SEGARRA: ...Or that other people review badly. THOMAS: Yes. SEGARRA: If you love it, that's what matters. THOMAS: Yes, it's art. Books are art, so just like songs. Like, for example - I'm sure I'll get in trouble for saying this, but I do not like Taylor Swift. SEGARRA: (Laughter). THOMAS: I understand that a lot of people do. It's just, it's not for me. It's OK to read something that other people don't like. There's an audience for every single book. You may or may not be that audience, but there are people out there who will like it. So I always try to keep that in mind when I talk about books publicly and when I give people book recommendations. SEGARRA: How do you know, on the flip side, when you're reading that you don't like the book and that you're ready to put it down? Like, how much of a chance do you usually give something? THOMAS: OK, so for my work, I have to read books and finish books that I do not always like. I can tell you, usually, within 10 to 20 pages if I will like a book. And part of that is because I read so much. I think, for most people, though, you know. You know if you don't like something. I think if you're falling asleep while you're reading it, that's a good sign that maybe you don't like it. I think that if you are constantly checking your phone while you're reading that that might be a sign that you don't like it. I think that if you want to do anything else but read, that might be a sign that you don't like what you're reading. I think that if you are rolling your eyes as you're reading the sentences, that might be a good sign that you don't like something. I think it's like everything else. You know what is not for you. SEGARRA: Yeah, and then it is A-OK to put it down. THOMAS: Put it down. Save yourself. There are too many books in the world to read books you do not like. You know what I think? I think that if you are not finishing a book, that is called cultivating taste. (SOUNDBITE OF THOMAS GALLICANI'S \"LOST IN YESTERDAY\") SEGARRA: By the way, if you want to read more and you're having trouble getting into the practice, Traci has tips for that, too. One thing you can do is set an achievable goal, like, I'm going to read 12 books in a year. That worked when she was in a rut. THOMAS: And then I just hit my stride. It made it a practice for me. Now the goal that I have is I read 10 pages a day at minimum. Obviously, some days, I read 300 pages. And some days, I don't quite get to 10. But for me, 10 pages a day felt like, OK, I can commit to this. It's probably 10 to 15 minutes of reading. And if I go beyond, great - and if not, I'm not going to, you know, kick myself in the butt for it. SEGARRA: Finally, back to those book recommendations. Based on everything I said, especially my love of adventure tales, Traci recommended \"Lucky Red.\" THOMAS: I haven't read it yet. But everyone that I respect who has read it, loved it. And it's, like, a queer, lesbian Western. And my friend described it as kiss, kiss, bang bang, which I thought was a fantastic way to describe a book. SEGARRA: She also suggested a book called \"Deep As The Sky, Red As The Sea.\" It's another adventure novel that her friend loved. An online description calls it a historical novel about a legendary Chinese pirate queen, her fight to save her fleet from the forces allied against them and the dangerous price of power.

makes Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissues, is buying the company that makes Tylenol and Band-Aids in one of the biggest mergers of the year. The deal, worth almost $49 billion, comes at a particularly difficult time for Tylenol-maker Kenvue, after the Trump administration linked acetaminophen — the active ingredient in this common painkiller —  to autism . The assertions came despite a lack of clear scientific evidence, and Kenvue has called them simply false. For Kimberly-Clark, the deal adds a new swath of consumer brands. Besides Tylenol, Kenvue also owns other pharmacy mainstays such as Band-Aid, Listerine, Neutrogena and Aveeno.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Kimberly-Clark CEO Mike Hsu said in  Monday's announcement , that the two \"iconic companies\" would create \"a global health and wellness leader.\"  Executives from both companies said the combined entity would serve people \"at every stage of life\" and benefit from Kenvue's relationships with dermatologists, dentists, pediatricians and other healthcare professionals.  Kimberly-Clark has been attempting to challenge the dominance of consumer goliath Procter & Gamble, whose business spans all drugstore aisles, including cold and digestion medicines.  And Kenvue has been on the selling block for a while now, ever since it was  spun off from Johnson & Johnson  in 2023. Its share price collapsed a few months after going public, losing a third of its value since the start of the year before Monday's news.

Climate change is affecting our food, and our food is affecting the climate. NPR is dedicating a week to  stories and conversations about the search for solutions . Each week, people in the U.S. eat the equivalent of  three burgers' worth  of beef. That's according to Richard Waite, a senior research associate in the food program at the World Resources Institute. But if Americans could reduce that consumption by half, it could have a major impact on creating a more sustainable food system, according to projections from WRI. That's because meat production is hard on the environment: It requires a lot of land to raise cattle  — and globally, many forests are being cleared to make room for those animals. Deforestation releases lots of heat-trapping carbon dioxide that had been stored in the trees into the environment. And cows themselves release a lot of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas,  in the form of burps. If people in the U.S. and other heavy meat-eating countries could  cut back their beef consumption  down to just 1.5 burgers a week, \"it would actually make it possible to feed 10 billion people by 2050 without any further deforestation,\" says Waite. How to cut back on meat To curb your diet's environmental impact and fight climate change, you  could  go vegetarian or vegan — but you don't have to. It turns out, cutting back a little can have a big impact. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Experts like Waite recommend eating less of the most resource-intensive meats: goat, lamb and especially beef — the most commonly consumed of these meats. Cows \"take the most land to grow and feed,\" he says. If you're a meat lover, these tips and recipes can help you dial back your meat intake — and explore new flavors you might really enjoy: Don't start from scratch  \"I always tell people to start by adding to the familiar foods that they're already making,\"  says  Tracye McQuirter , a public health nutritionist and author. Having stir-fry? Swap in plant-based proteins for meat — try adding tofu, cashews, almonds, mushrooms or edamame.  Consider frozen and bulk foods  If you're shopping on a budget, McQuirter suggests cutting costs by buying beans and nuts in bulk and shopping for frozen vegetables, which she says are \"just as nutritious\" as fresh.   Spices are your friend  Spices and seasonings can go a long way in bringing the flavors you love into your food. \"If you love Thai, if you love Ethiopian, if you love Caribbean [food]— keep those spices on hand as well,\" she says.  Eat the rainbow  Try to have at least three colors on your plate at a time. \"They each reflect specific nutrients and antioxidants — cancer-fighting agents — in your food,\" says McQuirter. \"The way that you really know that you're getting the nutrients that you need on a plant-based diet is just by having variety. So don't focus on the day, focus on the week, and just have a variety of grains and beans and fruits and vegetables.\" Looking for inspiration for your next meatless Monday? McQuirter shared two vegan recipes to help you kick off a diet lighter in meat, but still rich in flavor.    Vegetable Pot Pie Ingredients:  2 tablespoons water or extra-virgin olive oil 1 yellow onion, diced 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped ½ cup finely chopped mushrooms 1/2 (13.5-ounce) can light or regular coconut milk (or more, if desired)  1 tablespoon whole wheat or oat flour 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast 2 teaspoons sea salt 1 teaspoon thyme ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 cups frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, corn, peas, and green beans)  1 (13.5-ounce) can or carton of chickpeas, drained 2 (9-inch) frozen prepared whole-grain pie crusts, thawed Freshly ground black pepper, to taste Directions:  Preheat oven to 375°F. In a large soup pot, heat the water or oil over medium heat. Stir in the onions and garlic, and sauté until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and sauté for another 3 minutes. Add the milk, flour, nutritional yeast, salt, thyme, and cayenne, and mix until thoroughly combined. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring often. Place the vegetable mixture in a large bowl and stir in frozen vegetables and chickpeas. Stir in black pepper, taste, and adjust seasonings, as desired.  Spoon the filling into the bottom pie crust. Cover the filling with the top pie crust, cut away the excess crust, and crimp the edges of the crusts together to seal. Make three small slits in the top center. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until crust turns golden brown. Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving. The pot pie can be stored in the freezer in an airtight container for up to 3 months.  Makes 6-8 servings.  Savory Vegetable Quiche Ingredients:  Crust: 1 (9-inch) whole grain piecrust  Filling:  1 block firm tofu, drained and pressed (see directions)  3 tablespoons nutritional yeast  2 teaspoons oregano  1/2 teaspoon sea salt  Vegetables: 2 tablespoons olive oil  2 small leeks or 1 large leek, thinly sliced, white part only (about 1 cup)  3 garlic cloves, finely chopped  4 medium zucchinis or 2 large zucchinis, thinly sliced, about 1/8-inch thick  1 teaspoon sea salt  Cayenne pepper, to taste  Freshly ground black pepper, to taste  2 cups baby spinach  1/2 cup basil leaves, loosely packed  Directions:  Crust: Preheat oven to 375°F. Thaw piecrust for 10 minutes. Place the crust in the oven for 10 minutes and then set aside.  Filling: Squeeze the excess water out of the tofu by pressing it in a towel. Place the tofu, nutritional yeast, oregano, and salt in a food processor and process until smooth.  Vegetables: In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Stir in the leeks and garlic, and sauté until the leeks are translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring often. Add zucchini, salt, and cayenne, stirring often until the zucchini is tender, about 5 minutes, and then remove from heat. Place zucchini mixture in a large bowl and stir in the spinach, basil, and tofu mixture. Taste and adjust seasoning, as desired. Spoon the filling into the piecrust, smooth out with the back of a spoon. Bake until firm, about 35 minutes, then let sit for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 6-8 servings.  The podcast version of this episode was produced by  Clare Marie Schneider.   We'd love to hear from you. Leave us a voicemail at 202-216-9823 or email us at  LifeKit@npr.org .

In this episode, how to eat less meat so you can help the environment and your diet. If that feels like a big ask, you can actually start pretty small. We're going to start with a yes or no question. Do you need to cut out all the meat in your diet to make an environmental impact? RICHARD WAITE: No, you don't. GODOY: That's Rich Waite. He's a senior research associate in the food program at the World Resources Institute. He's going to walk us through the environmental impact of meat production and consumption. And seriously, you don't have to become vegan or vegetarian to make an impact. Even Rich, who knows all the research, says he still eats meat. WAITE: I am an omnivore. I eat pretty much everything. GODOY: But when thinking about meat consumption, Rich says, we want to cut back on the most resource-intensive meats. Those are the animals that take the most land to grow and feed, which means beef and lamb. So while we're not telling you to cut out meat altogether, we are going to help you rethink your relationship to meat. Think abundance, not lack. TRACYE MCQUIRTER: And so I always tell people to think about what you're gaining. GODOY: That's Tracye McQuirter, public health nutritionist and author. So once Rich gives us all the environmental facts, Tracye is going to help us actually put all that information into action with tips for eating a more plant-based diet. MCQUIRTER: That's really a mindset shift, I think, for people to think about, you know, what they're gaining rather than what they're missing out on. GODOY: And if you're feeling discouraged or unsure if your personal consumption can really make an impact, remember this. WAITE: Well, it all adds up 'cause there's, you know, almost 8 billion people on the planet today, and there's going to probably be about 10 billion of us on the planet by 2050. GODOY: So you can do your part. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GODOY: When we talk about the environmental impact of meat production, why is it that it does have such a big environmental footprint? How much is beef production a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions? WAITE: Well, the food system as a whole, when you're looking at agriculture and deforestation, contributes about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, and animal agriculture contributes about 14.5%. And within that, beef production is about 40% of those animal agricultural emissions, so it's about 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions. GODOY: Just beef - we're just talking about cattle, right? WAITE: Correct. GODOY: And why is it that producing meat has such a big footprint on the environment? WAITE: So beef production causes greenhouse gas emissions in a few ways. Cows and other ruminant animals emit methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas, as they digest grasses and plants. GODOY: These are the cow burps. WAITE: That's right. These are the cow burps - technically called enteric fermentation, which the cow burps. And there's also methane that gets emitted from manure and also nitrous oxide, which is another powerful greenhouse gas. And then also, rising beef production and consumption also requires increasing quantities of land, and so as the global population grows and people consume more meat, more trees are cut down for pasture, land and for growing crops. And that releases carbon dioxide, which is stored in the forests. GODOY: OK, so it's both the cows themselves burping out methane and also the land needed to raise them being deforested, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions. WAITE: Correct. GODOY: Got it. But when we talk about changing our diet to have an impact on this, you know, the question is, can little old me personally cutting back on meat make a dent in this problem? I mean, can my diet choices really make a difference? WAITE: If you think about here in the U.S., we eat a relatively high amount of meat per person, and the average U.S. diet takes about two acres to grow all of the food that we eat per person. And about half of that is from beef production, and about - more than 80% of it is for all meat and dairy combined. So if you think about it, shifting to a diet that is - you know, has less meat and has more plants in it will reduce the amount of land that it takes to grow your diet. And if you add that up across millions or billions of people, it makes it easier to feed a growing population without knocking down more forests. GODOY: How much would we have to cut out beef 'cause you said that beef is the prime offender, right? WAITE: So just to give you a, you know, sense of this, we looked at some different scenarios, and we found that, for example, if people in the U.S. cut back their beef consumption by about half - so we eat about three burgers - burger equivalents - per person per week, and we looked at a scenario in which people cut back to about 1 1/2 burgers per person per week. If we did that here, it would actually make it possible to feed 10 billion people by 2050 without any further deforestation - again, because it reduces the amount of land that it takes to feed each person. GODOY: So if you are cutting back on red meat, what are the best options for replacements from an environmental perspective? Let's say, is chicken just as good as fish, for instance? RICH WAITE: As it goes, chicken and fish are both on the lower end of resource intensity in terms of animal protein production. You can be pretty flexible about it. GODOY: I've had friends over the years who've gone vegetarian, and a lot of them tended to replace meat with dairy products. Does that approach actually help or, you know, do you really want to be replacing meat with plants? WAITE: Well, that's interesting that you mention that because we found that as well. And so when we were modeling impacts of different diets, that's one of the things that came out, is if you look at what vegetarians actually eat, they tend to replace a certain amount of the meat that they're no longer eating with dairy products or with eggs. And, you know, again, dairy products are going to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than, you know, plant-based foods. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WAITE: So if you do switch completely towards plants, you will have a greater impact, but we looked at the impact of the average U.S. diet versus a vegetarian version of the U.S. diet that includes some dairy and eggs. And the vegetarian diet took about half the amount of land and about half the greenhouse gas emissions as an average American diet. GODOY: Got it. So you don't have to give up your dairy if you want to (laughter) - if you want to make an impact. WAITE: That's right. And you don't - and again, you don't even have to give up beef. It's just about kind of shifting the proportion, the mix of what you're doing. GODOY: OK, good to know because I still like cheeseburgers. I'm sorry. (LAUGHTER) GODOY: When we are talking about beef specifically, are there certain techniques for raising the cattle that make it better for the environment than other techniques? Or, you know, is grass-fed beef better, for instance? WAITE: So on grass-fed beef, it's actually tricky because finishing cattle on grass instead of finishing them on grain in feedlots, it leads to slower animal growth and the cattle tend to be slaughtered at a lower weight. And what then happens is that land use and greenhouse gas emissions per pound of grass-finished beef actually tend to be higher than that of conventional grain-finished beef. Right now, it's still easier to shift what you're eating towards plants and also minimize your food waste as kind of surefire ways to reduce your diet's footprint. And, you know, hopefully one day, we'll be able to walk into the grocery store and see a bunch of carbon labeling in the beef section. You can pick out the most climate friendly cuts of meat, but we're not there yet. GODOY: And what about buying local meat? Does that make an environmental impact? WAITE: So I think, you know, a lot of people have an intuition that food miles are sort of a really important component of the climate impact associated with the food that we eat. And actually, especially when you're talking about meat, emissions from transport is actually very small, and it's a lot smaller than the emissions from producing the food. So there was a study that was done a few years ago that estimated that production - it was, like, 83% of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the U.S. diet and transportation was only 11%. So, you know, eating local meat, it's going to be a less effective climate strategy than eating less meat and more plants. GODOY: It can seem overwhelming when you're trying to cut back on meat. I'm wondering, are there examples in the past where we've actually overhauled our whole diet as a society? That's a big thing. And we're a big meat-eating country, right? WAITE: Yeah, well, it's interesting. If you actually look back at the eating patterns in the U.S. back to the 1970s, we've actually already cut back on per-person beef consumption by about one-third. And Americans still eat about the same amount of meat overall as they did in the 1970s, but they shifted from beef toward chicken. And the interesting thing about that, too, is if you look back to the 1970s, overall beef production in the U.S. has held pretty steady because we've added another 120 million Americans to the population. If you're thinking about, you know, the global challenge, we're looking at something similar, right? We're going to be adding another two billion people to the human family. You know, under business as usual, we could be looking at a lot more deforestation to, you know, clear the land to feed everybody. And if we think about the kinds of changes that we can make to eat a diet that has a lower footprint, we can - you know, we can sustainably feed more people. GODOY: So we've done it before, basically (laughter). WAITE: Exactly. Not unprecedented. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GODOY: That's Rich Waite of the World Resources Institute. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GODOY: Eating less red meat and more plants isn't just good for the environment. It's good for your health, too. MCQUIRTER: It's really important to know that the food that you eat is the most important in determining your quality of life right now and your quality of life in the future. GODOY: That's Tracye McQuirter, public health nutritionist and author, and she knows that diet matters. MCQUIRTER: We know that eating more whole grains, more fresh fruits and vegetables and more plant-based proteins are the healthiest foods we can eat because they don't come with cholesterol and zero or very little saturated fat, which can clog your arteries and lead to cardiovascular disease. And heart disease is the No. 1 killer in the country. So we want to eat more plant-based foods or all plant-based foods. But definitely start out, wherever you are, by adding more plant-based foods to your plate and less meat. GODOY: Right. And just so listeners know, we've actually included some of Tracye's plant-based recipes online at /lifekit. So, Tracye, what are some impactful but smaller changes you can make to your diet if you want to start eating less meat? MCQUIRTER: Well, I like to start by suggesting that people add, and so that means adding more plant-based proteins to your plate. So, for example, if you're making a stir-fry for dinner and you have colorful vegetables, you're having that over brown rice, for example, you can add in tofu. You can add in cashews. You can add in almonds. You can add in pecans as your protein. You can add in edamame as your protein instead of meat and still have a really delicious, healthy dish. And so I always tell people to start by adding to the familiar foods that they're already making. GODOY: So one concern that's often raised, though, about eating more produce is price. Good produce can be expensive. How can we make this change of adding more fruits and vegetables into our life and cutting back on meat without breaking the bank? MCQUIRTER: It's really, really not hard to eat healthy on a budget if you are eating whole foods. So, for example, getting beans or nuts from the bulk bin - they're much cheaper per pound than it would be to have that same dish, but you have to buy meat to put in it. You can buy frozen food, and frozen vegetables are just as nutritious. They're actually usually flash frozen, so the nutrients remain intact. So you can have frozen vegetables just as easily, and you can keep them in the freezer for months. GODOY: What are some practical tips for cutting out meat in terms of meal prep or, you know, just things we should stock in our pantry? MCQUIRTER: So I would definitely suggest stocking up on beans and add them to any dish that you're having. You can have them in tacos. You can have them in a wrap. You can have them on a salad. You can have them in a stir-fry. You can have them in a soup or a chili. So just think about beans in a different color. So if you're going to your supermarket, just kind of look in the bulk bin and just choose some colorful beans and always have those on hand. Try to have at least three colors on your plate, and, you know, don't be afraid to have more than one vegetable at a time to add to those colors. GODOY: It takes a little planning to soak those dried beans, but you can also buy canned ones. Either way, it's actually a great source of protein and a staple at my house. But let's dig into that whole idea of colors. Why is it important to eat the rainbow when we're talking about fruits and vegetables? MCQUIRTER: They each reflect specific nutrients and antioxidants, cancer-fighting agents in your food. So that's why you want to focus on the color, because it means more nutrients. Also, you want to have whole grains on hand. They're high in protein and also many, many other nutrients that are good for you - iron, calcium, potassium, magnesium. The way that you really know that you're getting the nutrients that you need on a plant-based diet is just by having variety. So don't focus on the day. Focus on the week, and just have a variety of grains and beans and fruits and vegetables and also just seasonings - your favorite seasoning. Seasonings are important for whatever type of foods that you're eating, whatever type of diet that you have, right? If you love Thai, if you love Ethiopian, if you love Caribbean, keep those spices on hand as well. GODOY: What's the biggest challenge most people face when they're trying to cut down on the meat in their diet? MCQUIRTER: I think the biggest challenge is thinking about, you know, like a plate. What is going to replace, you know, that meat? So think about making simple meals that you already are making and you're just swapping out the protein. You're swapping out an animal-based protein for a meat-based protein. So if you're making a pasta, if you're making a soup, even if you're making a fajita, a burrito, a wrap, you can use beans and nuts and tofu, edamame, mushrooms. So there's so many wonderful options. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GODOY: That's author and nutritionist Tracye McQuirter. OK, let's recap. You don't have to cut out all the meat in your diet to make an environmental impact. From an environmental standpoint, not all meat is equal. Beef and lamb are the most resource-intensive meats, so if you're eating for the planet, try to cut back on those. You know, instead of a burger, sub in fish or eggplant. Think about what you can add to your plate rather than what you're taking off. Tracye recommends substituting meat with other sources of protein like beans, tofu and nuts. We've included some of her plant-based recipes online at /lifekit.

Jahd Khalil, Margaret Barthel, Brad Kutner \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 2:21 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Several late-breaking surprises have shaken up what political watchers thought would be a quiet race in Virginia. The commonwealth's gubernatorial race — one of just two held the year after presidential elections — is often seen as a temperature check on how voters feel about leaders in Washington. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee and former congresswoman, has maintained a lead in polls since very early in the race over Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. But this year, while  voters' top concerns  are energy prices, housing affordability and jobs, the rest of the race has become a referendum on everything from political violence to redistricting. Here, public media journalists across Virginia take us into each issue. DOGE and the federal government shutdown The challenges  facing Virginia's 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors came long before the Oct. 1 government shutdown. Earlier this year, during Elon Musk's DOGE efforts, thousands of Virginians were laid off. Democrats in the commonwealth hope that voter anger over the firings and furloughs will carry them to victory on Tuesday night. On the campaign trail, Spanberger talks about sticking up for federal workers in the face of the \"chaos from Washington.\" At a campaign event Thursday, Spanberger put it this way: \"The stakes of this election are serious.\" As furloughs stretch into a second month, Virginia Republicans have also seen a political opening in the shutdown. \"My opponent, all summer long, has been playing political football with federal workers by trying to say that she loves them more than anyone else,\" Earle-Sears said on the debate stage, and then criticized Spanberger for encouraging Democrats in Congress to resist any funding deal that doesn't include continuing health care subsidies. But Earle-Sears hasn't shied away from the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce. She has said she believes claims of \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" and argues that the impact of layoffs in Virginia will be minimal due to the economic strength she and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin have stewarded over the previous four years. Political violence A scandal in the race for attorney general has reverberated up the ticket. Early last month,  text messages from 2022  show Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general and a former member of the Virginia legislature, describing hypothetical violence against a political opponent. Earle-Sears and other Republican candidates have tried to tie the text messages to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, painting Democrats as politically violent. Spanberger condemned the messages and political violence generally, but didn't withdraw or double down on her endorsement of Jones. \"It is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information,\" she said in the gubernatorial debate. Jones' Republican opponent, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, is appealing to Spanberger voters to split their tickets. Redistricting  Democrats in the Virginia legislature threw another wrench into the campaign last week by calling a surprise series of meetings after North Carolina became another state to redraw its congressional map to favor the GOP at the behest of President Trump. On Friday, the Virginia legislature proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms. Because it needs to be approved by legislators again next year before voters can finalize the amendment next spring, its success depends on Spanberger winning her race and Democrats maintaining control of the House of Delegates. How much the redistricting plan changes voters' minds is up for debate. Close to a million voters cast their ballots before the Democrats announced their plan, while the redistricting session took delegates off the trail during the final full week of campaigning. Earle-Sears, who presides over the state Senate in her role as lieutenant governor, was also called back to Richmond. She still managed to hold events  around the state , and a press conference on the steps of the Virginia Capitol, while a small crowd held \"Winsome For Governor\" signs. Spanberger has made few public comments about redistricting, beyond signaling her  general support . Transgender youth Republicans up and down the ballot have made Virginia's transgender youth a major campaign issue. The argument over transgender athletes and bathrooms in Virginia schools really took off when Republican Glenn Youngkin made it a focus of his 2021 campaign for governor. Arguably, it helped him become the first GOP governor elected in more than a decade. But, despite Republicans spending millions on ads around transgender students in 2025,  recent polling  shows it's a top concern for 3 percent of voters. The economy and countering Trump's policies are at the forefront of most voters' minds. Spanberger has said she likely leads on the subject because Republicans have been \"villainizing kids.\" \"Particularly efforts to heavily politicize a group of kids who need a bit of grace, and the adults around them to show thoughtfulness,\" the former congresswoman said. \"I'm not taking a stand because it's the easy thing to do. Of course, it's not easy. I'm being abused for it,\" Earle-Sears  said , comparing her support for cisgender students to the civil rights movement.

If you answer \"yes\" to any of these queries, you may want to reevaluate your purchase. Is your cash flow limited?  If you have to pull funds from what you've set aside for basic needs like housing, groceries, transportation or credit card payments, hold off on spending, Evans says. Don't pull from your emergency fund or the money you've saved for vacations, either.

Eat a piece of chocolate at home, or do something that feels good, like going for a walk in the sun. Is this part of a pattern?  Put your desire to spend into context. Let's say you love hunting for treasures at estate sales. \"If every weekend you're going to different antique stores to search, peel back a layer and ask what's going on,\" Evans says. \"How often are you shopping in this kind of way?\" You may find that you don't actually want to own a new thing. You just love the dopamine rush of discovering a new treasure and making a purchase. That awareness may be enough to put that card back in your wallet. Are you trying to impress someone?  Sometimes we buy the latest and greatest because we think it will bring us status, Evans says. \"Maybe you want people to look at you a certain way, and having this item may signify something [important].\" If this is the case, reflect on why this item matters so much to your self-esteem, and ask yourself why you care so much about what others think. \"That's where the juicy stuff starts to happen,\" she says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Are you going to buy it without doing research?  So you've decided to get a new mattress. Before you hit the \"Buy Now\" button, shop around for the best price and read reviews to make sure you're getting a good product, Vines says. Don't assume that more expensive products are higher quality, he says. \"Price does not guarantee performance.\" At the same time, don't buy something cheap when you can save up for something more expensive that will last. If you're not sure what to get, ask friends and family members for recommendations. \"Call your rich aunt who buys all the things you're interested in having and see if she actually likes it,\" Vines says. \"Call the person you know who is the most cost-conscious and ask them questions.\" Are you feeling so-so about it?  Let's say you have a craving for a doughnut. You head to the bakery to find that it's sold out. Should you get something else? For Vines, the answer is no. \"I'm not going to take a muffin or half a pie or a slice of tiramisu when I want one doughnut,\" he says. \"If it's not what you want, walk away.\" This story was edited by Meghan Keane.

He requested his last name be withheld, out of fear of his employer retaliating against him for speaking to the media. \"The fear,\" he says, \"has been more palpable with each passing day.\" Last week, Democratic Illinois  Gov. JB Pritzker  called for federal agents to pause \"Operation Midway Blitz\" (the Chicago immigration enforcement campaign) during the Halloween weekend. \"If you are unwilling to cease operations and leave our city, can we at least agree that our children should not be victims, especially on Halloween?\" Pritzker asked. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the request \"shameful.\" \"We're absolutely not willing to put on pause any work that we will do to keep communities safe,\"  she responded in a press conference .

Witnesses  shared  video  footage  of an agent holding a man down and repeatedly hitting him in the head. In a statement to NPR, a DHS spokesperson said that \"agents observed they were being aggressively tailgated by a red vehicle. As agents tried to make a U-turn, the red car crashed into Border Patrol. A hostile crowd surrounded agents and their vehicle, and began verbally abusing them and spitting on them.

a global hunger authority says \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 10:14 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         CAIRO — Famine has spread to two regions of war-torn Sudan, including a major city in Darfur where paramilitary fighters have been rampaging, a global hunger monitoring group said Monday, as the war has created the world's largest humanitarian disaster. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the leading international authority on hunger crises, said famine has been detected in el-Fasher in Darfur and Kadugli town in South Kordofan province. Twenty other areas in Darfur and Kordofan, where fighting has intensified in recent months, are also at risk of famine, according to the IPC. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       El-Fasher had been under siege by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces for 18 months, cutting off much food and other supplies to tens of thousands of people. Last week, RSF fighters seized el-Fasher, reportedly unleashing attacks that killed hundreds, though the scope of violence is unclear as communications are poor. Kadugli town also has been under RSF siege for months with tens of thousands of people trapped, as the paramilitary group tries to seize more territory from its rival, the Sudanese military. 'Extremely high levels of malnutrition' The war has torn Sudan apart since April 2023. More than 40,000 people have been killed, according to U.N. figures, but aid groups say the true number could be many times higher. The fighting has driven more than 14 million people from their homes and fueled disease outbreaks. The latest IPC report said el-Fasher and Kadugli have experienced \"a total collapse of livelihoods, starvation, extremely high levels of malnutrition and death.\" Famine is determined in areas where deaths from malnutrition-related causes reach at least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000; at least one in five people or households severely lack food and face starvation; and at least 30% of children under 5 suffer from acute malnutrition based on a weight-to-height measurement — or 15% based on upper-arm circumference. The IPC has confirmed famine only a few times, most recently in northern Gaza earlier this year amid Israel's campaign against Hamas. It also confirmed famine in Somalia in 2011 and South Sudan in 2017 and 2020. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The IPC previously declared famine in five locations in Sudan. Three were sprawling refugee camps near el-Fasher that have emptied as RSF troops advanced, with most people fleeing into el-Fasher or nearby towns. The other locations were in parts of South and West Kordofan provinces that have since also fallen into RSF hands. The new report warned that towns near el-Fasher, including Tawila, Melit and Tawisha, are at risk of famine. It said about 375,000 people had been pushed into famine in Darfur and Kordofan as of September, and another 6.3 million people across Sudan face extreme levels of hunger. Paramilitary focuses on Darfur Since Sudan's military retook the capital, Khartoum, earlier this year, the RSF has turned its focus to the Darfur region in the west, and on taking Kordofan to secure supply lines toward the country's center. Save the Children in September said food supplies had run out in Kadugli, where it said fighting had escalated. Another Kordofan town, Dilling, has reportedly experienced the same conditions as Kadugli, but the IPC didn't announce famine there for lack of data, the new report said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Across Sudan, the IPC said more than 21 million people, or 45% of the population, faced acute food insecurity as of September, a 6% drop from the previous report which covered the period from December 2024 until May this year. The drop was due to reduced conflict and improved humanitarian access in Khartoum, neighboring Gezira province and the eastern province of Sennar after military regained control of Khartoum and Gezira, allowing more than a million displaced people to return home. The IPC called for a ceasefire as the sole measure that \"can prevent further loss of life and help contain the extreme levels of acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-store-fire-explosion-hermosillo-9d4f7ead04fbfaa435ff77cb0c1e3768","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:12:55+00:00","title":"Fire and Explosion at Waldo’s Store in Hermosillo Kills at Least 23, Injures 12","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fire and explosion at the Waldo’s convenience store in Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora state in Mexico, killed at least 23 people, including children, and injured 12 others.

Try thinking less \n         By Andee Tagle, Clare Marie Schneider \n        \n           Tuesday, June 3, 2025 • 9:36 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Life is filled with big decisions. Should you move across the country? Start a business? Have a baby? Break up? If you're not sure what to do,  Nell Wulfhart  has some counterintuitive advice. Don't keep deliberating. In fact, spend less time thinking about it. In her over 10 years as a decision coach, Wulfhart has helped more than 600 people, from CEOs to artists, make difficult choices. She says nearly all her clients are able to find clarity within an hour of working together. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In her experience, \"most people take way too long to make decisions. They get mired down in the analysis,\" she says. That's partly due to a fear of regret, Wulfhart says. \"Everyone is trying so hard to avoid that uncomfortable feeling.\" But part of getting unstuck is accepting that some regret is inevitable. If you're struggling with indecision, Wulfhart offers exercises and advice to help you make faster choices with more confidence. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. How do you make good decisions quickly?  There are two exercises I give every client. First, make a list of your values. Not moral or corporate values, but the things that make your life good on a daily basis. Mine include: never setting an alarm clock, being able to wear sweatpants all the time, being in warm weather. Put them in order of importance. Then when you're making a decision, go down the list and see which one of your options checks more boxes on that list of values. The second exercise is to sketch out your ideal life in one year's, five years' and 10 years' time. Once you have written down what you'd like your life to look like, take the options you're deciding between and see whether you can draw a straight line from that option to the life you want. Can you share an example of these exercises in practice?  I had a client who had a job offer that was better paid and more prestigious. On paper, that seemed like an easy decision: Take the job. But in five years, she wanted to have a thriving business of her own, a business that was so successful she could take time off to spend with her kids. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       We decided she should stay in her current job, save money and start working very hard at building her own business, so that in five years she could actually have the thing she wanted. Can you speak to the role of regret when it comes to making decisions?  The decision-making business is really just the regret-minimization business. And because my big thing is about getting people to make decisions faster, we just have to accept that yes, occasionally, we will regret our choice. We can eliminate a lot of regret by just moving faster. Many more people regret taking too long to make a decision than making a decision too quickly. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you spend a year trying to figure out if you should go to grad school or three years deciding if you should get engaged, I've found that people regret the time they have lost deciding so much more than the occasional decision they made too hastily. What are some other ways we can minimize regret in decision-making?  People who feel less regret are people who are able to say, \"I made the best decision I could with the information I had at the time, and this outcome — I couldn't know it in advance.\" We are just taking our best possible guess at the time with the information we have. Sometimes that thing is not gonna work out. It turns out your new boss is a micromanager or your new apartment has rats.  Those things were impossible to know when you were making the decision. The outcome is mostly outside our control. The decision is entirely within our control. You also talk about testing things out. The way we make good decisions is not by sitting at home and wondering if we're going to like something. It is by trying the thing out. Then we have actual, tangible data that tells us whether or not we like something. I coached somebody once who was thinking about becoming a social worker. I told them, before you commit tens of thousands of dollars and two years of your life to getting this master's in social work, why don't you spend a few days shadowing someone who is a social worker?   You say that asking too many people for their advice can actually make it tougher to make a choice. Why is that?  By the time someone comes to me, sometimes they've talked to 10 or 20 different people. It just really muddies the waters. They're not helping you make the decision. When making a big decision, talk to three to five people and that's it. Think about your past history with everyone and ask yourself: Does this person support me and give good advice? If you know you are talking to somebody whose values are different from yours, who doesn't respect the way you live your life, or who always has negative things to say about your choices, do not talk to them. Make the decision and then tell them that's what you've decided to do. Why do some people double down on decisions they know might be bad for them, but feel like they should stick to?  People think all the time about sunk costs: the time they've put into something, the money they've invested, the years of building the relationship. They spend almost no time thinking about the opportunity costs. They might be missing out on job opportunities or relationship opportunities by staying in a situation that's not what they want. Even just trying to get to the thing you actually want is usually more rewarding. But people are very attached to their sunk costs. It can be hard to convince them to leave those behind.

       Monday, November 3, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         LOS ANGELES — Adelaide Stone Van Gessel says she doesn't agree with partisan gerrymandering in practice. But she voted yes on Proposition 50, a California  ballot measure  that would allow the state's Democratic leaders to temporarily bypass California's independent redistricting commission and enact a more Democratic-friendly congressional map ahead of next year's midterm elections. Van Gessel and others who back Prop 50 told NPR the proposal provides the Democratic-leaning state a rare opportunity to directly counteract President Trump and Republican efforts to redraw political maps in their favor in other states. \"What we're doing is gerrymandering to stop gerrymandering,\" she said. \"And that's not really the best solution, but it is something that we find ourselves in this kind of environment having to do.\" Voting for the one-issue special election concludes Tuesday, with polling showing that  Prop 50 is likely to pass . If it does, California's Democratic state leaders can use a new congressional map that makes five U.S. House seats more favorable to the party, offsetting the five districts Republicans  shifted their direction in Texas  earlier this year. GOP lawmakers in  Missouri  and  North Carolina  have also enacted new maps, and  a bipartisan deal reached last week in Ohio  tilts that state's congressional map further to the right. Lawmakers in other states, including Virginia Democrats, could join the redistricting fight. In Southern California, many left-leaning voters approving Prop 50 reported having mixed feelings about the measure, but ultimately felt that allowing a partisan gerrymander is one of the only options they have to stop Trump from shutting out a Democratic win in Congress next year. \"We can't play the game like decent people anymore,\" said Stephanie Eberstein, who, like Van Gessel, lives in the liberal LA neighborhood of Venice. \"I mean, those rules are out the window. So, we have to do what we have to do.\" In Orange County, Eva Hernandez agrees. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We got to do something,\" Hernandez said. \"Can't just sit back and let things roll like they've been rolling. … California's got to do it. We're a blue state. We got to do what we got to do to counteract that.\" Republican voters in California fear losing representation With surveys showing Prop 50 likely to be approved, it appears none of the opposition's arguments against the measure is truly landing in a state that is strongly Democratic. A number of voters told NPR they're focused on the current proposal, and could not recall how they voted about 15 years ago, when the state's citizen-led, nonpartisan redistricting commission was enacted. Kathy Brewer voted no on Prop 50. She lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, one of a few GOP-leaning enclaves in Southern California. She told NPR she thinks this special election and redraw are unnecessary. \"It's a waste of money,\" she said. \"Of good California money that we need.\" Betty Roth is another no vote. She says that as a Republican she already feels pretty powerless in the state. Out of the 52 seats California has in the U.S. House, only nine are currently held by Republicans. Roth says she doesn't want the GOP to lose what little representation it has. \"They're trying to take away the vote from a good portion of the American people by, you know, gerrymandering,\" she said. But a lot of Democratic voters don't feel much sympathy for this argument. Aaron Leal, who also lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, says Republicans are trying to rig the midterms in their favor because they aren't sure they can win on policy. He says the party is practically forcing Democrats to react. \"If one side is going full force pushing their agenda, we cannot bring, as they say, like a knife to a gunfight,\" he said. Leal says he also likes that the measure is temporary. After 2030, the state would go back to the independent redistricting commission. \"Somebody has to do something\" Polling shows the Democratic base has been largely frustrated with their leaders — mostly because they haven't been able to do much. \"The Democrats haven't really fought back and done anything to combat what's going on with the Republican Party and Trump,\" said David Checel in Culver City. \"So, yeah. I don't know what you're supposed to do on this, and I'm glad I'm not a politician.\" Checel wasn't thrilled about Prop 50 but voted in favor of it because it's better than doing nothing, he said. Other Democrats say they are really excited to see their leaders fight back, including Reina Santiago in Venice. \"I'm glad that our state is taking the charge against this because somebody has to do something,\" she said. \"The GOP is totally complicit with Trump, and if we let them walk all over us, they'll do it. So that's what this vote is about.\" And while Jim Lind, who lives in Irvine, agrees with this sentiment, he said he's also pretty sad that this is what politics has become. \"It's unfortunate that any party, whatever it may be, has to stoop to a lower level to get things done,\" he said. \"You know, all my life I've probably been more idealistic as far as the honesty of people. And it's just not working out.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-xi-china-taiwan-853adf6a760375dc2dfc66ea59c8d60c","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"17:15:45+00:00","title":"Trump Claims Xi Jinping Assured Him China Would Not Attack Taiwan While He’s in Office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump claims that Chinese President Xi Jinping assured him China would not take military action to unify Taiwan with mainland China during Trump’s presidency, following their meeting in South Korea.

(AP) — President Donald Trump says that Chinese President Xi Jinping has given him assurances that Beijing would take no action toward its long-stated goal of unifying Taiwan with mainland China while the Republican leader is in office. Trump said that the long-contentious issue of Taiwan did not come up in his talks with Xi on Thursday in South Korea that largely focused on U.S.-China trade tensions. But the U.S. leader expressed certainty that China would not take action on Taiwan, while he’s in office. “He has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, ‘We would never do anything while President Trump is president,’ because they know the consequences,” Trump said in an excerpt of an interview with the CBS’ program “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday. U.S. officials have long been concerned about the possibility of China using military force against Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy claimed by Beijing as part of its territory. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which has governed U.S. relations with the island, does not require the U.S. to step in militarily if China invades but makes it American policy to ensure Taiwan has the resources to defend itself and to prevent any unilateral change of status by Beijing.

Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, did not respond directly to a query about whether Trump has received any assurances from Xi or Chinese officials about Taiwan. He insisted in a statement that China “will never allow any person or force to separate Taiwan from China in any way.” “The Taiwan question is China’s internal affair, and it is the core of China’s core interests. How to resolve the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese people ourselves, and only the Chinese people can decide it,” the statement added. The White House also did not provide further details about when Xi or Chinese officials have conveyed to Trump that military action on Taiwan was off-the-table for the duration of the Republican’s presidency.

\n        \n           Updated Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 2:43 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         For Alicia Spradley, it all started with a quick prayer. Spradley from Chicago had seen the news that federal food aid was pausing at the start of November due to the government shutdown. With local food banks  already stretched thin , she worried that her neighbors might soon go hungry. So, on Monday night, she closed her eyes and asked, \"What can I do to help?\" A few hours later, she came across a post on a Facebook community group about becoming a \"grocery buddy\" — someone who buys groceries for a stranger or anyone at risk of losing their food benefits. Without hesitation, Spradley wrote her own callout, offering support. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said funding has run dry for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — better known as SNAP or food stamps — past October. For nearly 42 million Americans who rely on the assistance, that means their debit-like EBT cards are at risk of not being refilled this month. Some states have committed funding to help fill the gap, but it's unclear how long the support can last. On Friday,  a federal judge ruled  that the USDA must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going and ordered an update by Monday. It remains unclear how the Trump administration will respond. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response to the limbo, there has been a wave of people nationwide on social media participating in an informal grocery buddy system until benefits are restored. Some \"buddies\" are sending gift cards, while others are shopping and dropping off groceries. In her neighborhood of Rogers Park, Spradley said more than two dozen people replied to her offer — some asking for help themselves, others pointing to friends or neighbors who need the support. \"I did not think that in just a short period of time that we would get that much interest,\" said Spradley, who also runs Plate & Pathways, a small nonprofit that works to combat food insecurity. SNAP is the largest anti-hunger program in the country. Most of its recipients are seniors, people with disabilities and families with children. Similarly, Spradley said many of the people who asked for her help were elderly or working families who struggled to find the time to visit a local food pantry. \"I'm glad that people have the courage to reach out and ask for help,\" she said. Hannah Coburn, a night-shift nurse in Spokane, Wash., felt the same way when she posted a callout on her private Facebook account. At first, most of the replies were from friends cheering on the idea. Then, a message popped up in her inbox: It was from an acquaintance she had met a few times at roller derby events. \"She said that it was really hard for her to reach out,\" Coburn said. \"It didn't even occur to me that she would be someone who would lose that.\" According to Coburn, the acquaintance said she had some money set aside for groceries but ended up using the funds for unexpected car repairs. Coburn's takeaway is that anyone could be relying on SNAP benefits and sometimes, the only way to find out who needs help is to offer it first. \" I hope that more people see that and get an idea of like, 'Oh, I could do something and maybe it could be helping somebody that I actually know,' \" she said. Others say they were motivated to step in because they had experienced financial hardship firsthand. Karie Fugett, an author from Dothan, Ala., said she grew up on food stamps and, later in life, faced periods of living in her car and not knowing where her next meal would come from. \"I am lucky right now to be able to afford groceries, afford my rent, all of that, but I haven't forgotten that in the past that wasn't the case and that people helped me,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Fugett is currently supporting two families on SNAP, totaling over $1,000. To do so, she said she plans to tap into funds that she saved to build her future house. \"I'll just figure out how to get that money back later,\" she said. \"I don't need it in this moment and other people need things in this moment, so that's a priority to me.\" Fugett also expressed frustration that families are at risk of going hungry as a result of lawmakers unable to reach an agreement to end the government shutdown. \"It's especially upsetting that it's because the people that we voted into office are not doing their job,\" she said. While grocery buddies offer immediate help, SNAP changes could cause long-term woes In North Carolina's Outer Banks, Micah Iverson, a project manager and musician, said he recently dropped off groceries for a single mother of four children in his community. The experience gave him a new perspective. \"I've never bought baby diapers before,\" he said. \"They're very expensive, in case you didn't know.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Iverson paid for the woman's groceries using a $300 gift card that he won at a trivia game. The night that he went to unload the bags into the woman's car, Iverson said they both were holding back tears. \" She kind of stopped me at the end and was like, 'I really didn't know what I was gonna do, so thank you,'\" he said. Although his gift card only lasted for one grocery trip, Iverson said he plans to check in and help out with groceries in a few weeks if SNAP remains stalled. \" We'll do this just until something changes,\" he said. The lapse in federal food and nutrition assistance isn't necessarily short-lived. Since the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July , SNAP has faced budget cuts and stricter eligibility rules. Starting this month, states must comply with new work requirements to qualify for the aid — a change that could leave  2.4 million people without benefits . Spradley in Chicago has been grappling with how to be a grocery buddy long-term. \" We're trying to figure this out as a community to make sure that we are not leaving anybody out and we are just coming up with things as we go,\" she said. Earlier this week, Spradley said she met with a mother who was panicking over how to feed her seven children this month. She handed the woman some cash — pooled from her wallet and donations — and what happened next surprised her. \" She's like, 'Anything that you know I can do to help you guys, let me know,'\" she said. \"And it just moves me because here is this person in need and they are still trying to be of service to the community.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:   The government shutdown and the current freeze in the anti-hunger program known as SNAP has left about 12% of the U.S. population with a potentially big gap in their grocery budgets. As lawmakers discuss potential solutions, some recipients are having their groceries paid for by neighbors and strangers who are footing the bill until the SNAP program is restored. It's part of a growing trend on social media. NPR's Juliana Kim reports. JULIANA KIM, BYLINE: Micah Iverson from Outer Banks, North Carolina, had just won a few hundred dollars at a trivia game when he heard about the SNAP freeze. Hours later, he saw on Facebook a friend pledging to cover groceries for anyone at risk of losing assistance. MICHA IVERSON: I saw that post, and I thought, well, I have 300 extra dollars. So let's get this started. KIM: Iverson wrote his own post. And soon after, he got a message from a woman saying... IVERSON: Hey. I have this neighbor. She's a single mom with four kids, and I think she is losing her SNAP benefits. KIM: When he reached out to the mom, he says she was shocked by the offer. Across the country, people have been participating in this informal system of grocery buddies amid fears that families who rely on SNAP may go hungry. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive the monthly benefit, most of whom are seniors, people with disabilities and families with children. When Hannah Coburn from Spokane, Washington, pledged to be a grocery buddy, she didn't realize she would be helping someone she's met at roller derby events. HANNAH COBURN: She had messaged me, and she said that it was really hard for her to reach out. KIM: The woman told Coburn she had money set aside for groceries but ended up needing it for unexpected car repairs. Coburn's takeaway is that anyone could be relying on SNAP benefits, and sometimes the only way to find out who needs help is to offer it first. In North Carolina, Iverson recently dropped off groceries to the mother of four. He says he couldn't help but choke up. IVERSON: She kind of stopped me at the end and was like, I really didn't know what I was going to do, so thank you. KIM: Iverson says he went in for a handshake and then... IVERSON: She was like, hug me, come on (laughter). This is very sweet of you. I was like, OK. KIM: That one grocery trip used up Iverson's entire gift card, but that doesn't mean he's done helping. He says if SNAP remains paused a few weeks from now, he'll check back in with the woman and buy more groceries. Juliana Kim, NPR News. PFEIFFER: If you or someone you know is in need of groceries during this uncertain period, The Emergency Food Assistance Program might be an option. It purchases food from farms and offers free monthly groceries to families who qualify. To find your local distribution sites, look up The Emergency Food Assistance Program in your state, then call or stop by a site to ask how to join. Meanwhile, two federal judges ruled on Friday that cutting off SNAP benefits is unlawful. They've given the Trump administration until tomorrow to come up for a plan to how to proceed.

of Michoacan was shot dead in a plaza in front of dozens of people who had gathered for Day of the Dead festivities, authorities said. Local politicians in Mexico are frequently victims of political and organized crime violence. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The mayor of the Uruapan municipality, Carlos Alberto Manzo Rodríguez, was gunned down Saturday night in the town's historic center. He was rushed to a hospital, where he later died, according to state prosecutor Carlos Torres Piña. A city council member and a bodyguard were also injured in the attack. The attacker was killed at the scene, Federal Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch told journalists Sunday. The attack on the mayor was carried out by an unidentified man who shot him seven times, García Harfuch said. The weapon was linked to two armed clashes between rival criminal groups operating in the region, he added. \"No line of investigation is being ruled out to clarify this cowardly act that took the life of the mayor,\" García Harfuch said. Michoacan is one of Mexico's most violent states and is a battleground among various cartels and criminal groups fighting for control of territory, drug distribution routes and other illicit activities. On Sunday, hundreds of Uruapan residents, dressed in black and holding up photographs of Manzo Rodríguez, took to the town's streets to accompany the funeral procession and bid farewell to the slain mayor. They chanted \"Justice! Justice! Out with Morena!,\" a reference to the ruling party of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. In recent months, the Uruapan mayor had publicly appealed to Sheinbaum on social media for help to confront the cartels and criminal groups. He had accused Michoacan's pro-government governor, Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla, and the state police of corruption. At the head of the procession, a man led Manzo Rodríguez's black horse, with one of the mayor's signature hats placed on the saddle. A group of musicians, also dressed in black, followed and played mariachi songs. In the narrow streets of the agricultural town, where avocados are the main crop, dozens of police and military officers stood guard around the area. The attack on Manzo Rodríguez, a former Morena legislator, was captured on video and shared on social media. The footage shows dozens of residents and tourists, some in costume and with painted faces, enjoying the event surrounded by hundreds of lit candles, marigold flowers and skull decorations. Then several gunshots ring out and people run for cover. In another video, a person is seen lying on the ground as an official performs CPR while armed police officers guard the area. Manzo Rodríguez had been under protection since December 2024, three months after taking office. His security was reinforced last May with municipal police and 14 National Guard officers, García Harfuch said, without specifying what prompted the measure. Manzo Rodríguez, who some nicknamed \"The Mexican Bukele\" in reference to the tough security policies of El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, took office as mayor of Uruapan after winning that year's midterm elections with an independent movement. The mayor's killing follows the death of Salvador Bastidas, mayor of the municipality of Tacambaro, also in Michoacan. Bastidas was killed in June along with his bodyguard as he arrived at his home in the town's Centro neighborhood. In October 2024, journalist Mauricio Cruz Solís was also shot in Uruapan shortly after interviewing Manzo Rodríguez. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-christian-genocide-trump-9e09e52e33e7efe2d2d27360d3695ef5","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:08:30+00:00","title":"Trump Threatens Military Action in Nigeria Over Alleged Christian Persecution","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump has issued a strong warning that he is instructing the Pentagon to prepare for potential military action in Nigeria, citing alleged persecution of Christians by radical Islamists.

Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.” Trump on Friday said “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and “radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter.” Trump’s comment came weeks after U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz urged Congress to designate Africa’s most populous country as a violator of religious freedom with claims of “Christian mass murder.” Nigeria’s population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough. Attacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes. While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur. Kimiebi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated the commitment of Nigeria to protect citizens of all religions. “The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion,” Ebienfa said in a statement on Saturday. “Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.” Nigeria was placed on the country of particular concern list by the U.S. for the first time in 2020 over what the State Department called “systematic violations of religious freedom.” The designation, which did not single out attacks on Christians, was lifted in 2023 in what observers saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit. ___ Madhani reported from West Palm Beach, Florida."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-food-lines-snap-6b55e2c21c0198f3309f3a45a55f33b6","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"21:49:16Z","title":"Food Pantries Across U.S. See Record Demand as SNAP Benefits Are Suspended During Government Shutdown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a government shutdown, the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was abruptly suspended, cutting off monthly benefits for 42 million Americans.

(AP) — People across the country formed long lines for free meals and groceries at food pantries and drive-through giveaways Saturday, after monthly benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, were suddenly cut off because of the ongoing government shutdown . In the New York borough of the Bronx, about 200 more people than usual showed up at the World of Life Christian Fellowship International pantry, many bundled in winter hats and coats and pushing collapsible shopping carts as they waited in a line that spanned multiple city blocks. Some arrived as early as 4 a.m. to choose from pallets of fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, juice, dry goods and prepared sandwiches. Mary Martin, who volunteers at the pantry, also relies on it regularly for food to supplement her SNAP payments. She said she usually splits her roughly $200 a month in SNAP benefits between herself and her two adult sons, one of whom has six children and is especially dependent on the assistance. “If I didn’t have the pantry to come to, I don’t know how we would make it,” Martin said.

However it was unclear as to when the debit cards that beneficiaries use could be reloaded after the ruling, sparking fear and confusion among many recipients. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on In an apparent response to President Donald Trump, who said he would provide the money but wanted more legal direction from the court, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the government to report back by Monday on how it would fund SNAP accounts. McConnell, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration must either make a full payment by that day or, if it decides to tap $3 billion in a contingency fund, figure out how to do that by Wednesday. The delay in SNAP payments, a major piece of the nation’s social safety net that serves about 42 million people, has highlighted the financial vulnerabilities that many face. At the Bronx food pantry, the Rev. John Udo-Okon said “people from all walks of life” are seeking help now. “The pantry is no longer for the poor, for the elderly, for the needy. The pantry now is for the whole community, everybody,” Udo-Okon said. “You see people will drive in their car and come and park and wait to see if they can get food.” In Austell, Georgia, people in hundreds of cars in drive-through lanes picked up nonperishable and perishable bags of food. Must Ministries said it handed out food to about 1,000 people, more than a typical bimonthly food delivery. Families in line said they worried about not getting SNAP benefits in time for Thanksgiving. At a drive-through food giveaway at the Calvary Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, SNAP recipient James Jackson, 74, said he is frustrated that people are being hurt by decisions made in Washington and lawmakers should try harder to understand challenges brought by poverty and food insecurity. “If you’ve never been poor, you don’t know what it is to be poor,” Jackson said. “I hope that it turns around. I hope that people get their SNAP benefits, and I hope we just come together where we can love each other and feed each other and help each other.” While there is typically a long line for Calvary Baptist Church’s drive-through events, the Rev. Samuel L. Whitlow said, the walk-in food pantry has seen increased demand recently with roughly 60 additional people showing up this week. And in Norwich, Connecticut, the St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen and food pantry had 10 extra volunteers working Saturday to help a wave of expected newcomers, making sure they felt comfortable and understood the services available. Besides groceries and hot meals, the site was providing pet food, toiletries and blood pressure checks. “They’re embarrassed. They have shame. So you have to deal with that as well,” director Jill Corbin said. “But we do our best to just try to welcome people.” ___ Haigh reported from Norwich, Connecticut.

Dozens of centers are missing out on federal grant payments that were due to arrive Nov. 1. Some say they’ll close indefinitely, while others are staying afloat with emergency funding from local governments and school districts. The closures mean Head Start students — who come from low-income households, are homeless or are in foster care — are missing out on preschool, where they are fed two meals a day and receive therapy vital to their development. “Children love school, and the fact that they can’t go is breaking their hearts,” said Sarah Sloan, who oversees small-town Head Start centers in Scioto County, Ohio. Staff told families they planned to close Monday. “It’s hampering our families’ ability to put food on the table and to know that their children are safe during the day.” A half-dozen Head Start programs never received grants that were anticipated in October, but there are now 140 programs that have not received their annual infusion of federal funding. All told, the programs have capacity to assist 65,000 preschoolers and expectant parents.

Those centers, created to assist the children of migrant farmworkers, typically operate on 10- to 12-hour days to accommodate the long hours parents work on farms. Government shutdown The AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them? Children attending the centers in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama and Oklahoma recently came home with fliers warning of possible closures, along with other parent notifications. Those centers serving more than 1,100 children will now remain closed until the shutdown ends, said East Coast Migrant Head Start Project CEO Javier Gonzalez. About 900 staff members across the centers also have been furloughed. In the absence of other options for child care, some parents’ only option may be to bring their young child to the fields where they work, Gonzalez said. Pause in food aid compounds struggles for Head Start families Many of the families that qualify for the federal preschool program also depend on food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , better known as SNAP or food stamps. That program also was on track to run dry of money due to the shutdown, although a pair of federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to keep the program running with emergency reserve funds. That means many Head Start families have been worried about food aid , along with the child care they rely on to make ends meet. A day without child care means a day without work for many parents — and a day without pay. In Kansas City, Missouri, Jhanee Hunt teaches toddlers at a Head Start site, the Emmanuel Family and Child Development Center, where her 6-month-old son is cared for in another classroom. The center said it can scrape up enough money to stay open for a few weeks, but the money won’t last much beyond November. At dropoff, she said, parents often are wearing uniforms for fast food restaurants like Wendy’s and McDonald’s. Some work as certified nurse assistants in nursing homes. None have much extra money. The most urgent concern right now is food, she said. “A lot of the parents, they’re, you know, going around trying to find food pantries,” she said. “A parent actually asked me, do I know a food pantry?” More than 90% of the center’s families rely on SNAP food assistance, said Deborah Mann, the center’s executive director. One construction company offered to help fill the grocery carts of some families that use the center. But overall, families are distressed, she said. “We’ve had parents crying. We’ve had parents just don’t know what to do,” Mann said. Some centers stay open — for now Launched six decades ago as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty, Head Start programs provide a range of services beyond early education, such as medical and dental screenings, school meals and family support to children from low-income households who can’t afford other child care options. The initiative is funded almost entirely by the federal government, leaving it with little cushion from funding disruptions. Some that have missed out on grant payments have managed to remain open, with philanthropies, school districts and local governments filling in gaps. Others are relying on fast-dwindling reserves and warn they can’t keep their doors open for much longer. “If the government doesn’t open back up, we will be providing less services each week,” said Rekah Strong, who heads a social services nonprofit that runs Head Start centers in southern Washington state. She’s already had to close one center and several classrooms and cut back home-based visiting services. “It feels more bleak every day.” In Florida, Head Start centers in Tallahassee and surrounding Leon County closed Oct. 27, but then reopened the next day thanks to a grant from Children’s Services Council of Leon County. The local school district and churches have stepped up to provide meals for the children. “It takes a village to raise a child, and our village has come together,” said Nina Self, interim CEO of Capital Area Community Action Agency. But children in rural Jefferson and Franklin counties, where the agency runs two small Head Start centers, were not as lucky. They’ve been closed since late October. ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

(AP) — Jacqueline Chapman is a retired school aide who relies on a $630 monthly Social Security check to get by. She was navigating the loss of her federal food aid benefits when she learned the assistance she receives for heating her Philadelphia apartment may also be at risk. “I feel like I’m living in scary times. It’s not easy to rest when you know you have things to do with limited accounts, limited funds. There isn’t too much you can do,” said Chapman, 74. Chapman relies on the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes. With temperatures beginning to drop in areas across the United States, some states are warning that funding for the program is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown , now in its fifth week. The anticipated delay comes as a majority of the 5.9 million households served by the federally funded heating and cooling assistance program are grappling with the sudden postponement of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries. Money is running out for other safety net programs as well and energy prices are soaring.

Commonly called LIHEAP, it serves all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and federally recognized tribes. “These are important income supports that are all potentially heading toward a cliff at the same time,” Wolfe said. “And I can’t point to a similar time in recent history where we’ve had this.” States are warning applicants about a funding delay LIHEAP, created in 1981, assists families in covering utility bills or the cost of paying for fuels delivered to homes, such as home heating oil. It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades. States manage the program. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data. While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet. Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. It is predicting payments will not go out until at least December, instead of November, as is customary. Minnesota’s energy assistance program is processing applications but the state’s Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. The agency does not plan to pay recipients’ heating bills until the shutdown ends. “As temperatures begin to drop, this delay could have serious impacts,” the agency said. The program services 120,000 households, both homeowners and renters, that include many older adults, young children and people with disabilities. Connecticut has enough money to set aside to pay heating bills through at least the end of November or December, according to the group that helps administer LIHEAP. But the program faces uncertainty if the shutdown persists. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves. “The situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,” said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. More than 100,000 households were served last year. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, blamed the federal shutdown and the delay in LIHEAP payments on congressional Democrats and said the Trump administration is committed to reopening the government. “Once the government reopens, ACF will work swiftly to administer annual awards,” the spokesperson said, referring to the Administration for Children and Families, an agency within HHS. The spokesperson did not directly answer whether the timing could be affected by the administration’s earlier decision to fire workers who run the LIHEAP program . Wolfe, from the group that represents state program directors, predicts there could be delays into January. He noted there are questions over who will approve states’ program plans and how the money will be released when it becomes available. “Once you’ve fired the staff, things just slow down,” he said. Low-income families face mounting obstacles Chapman, the retired school aide, may be eligible for a program through her gas utility to prevent being shut off this winter. But the roughly 9% of LIHEAP recipients who rely on deliverable fuels such as heating oil, kerosene, propane and wood pellets, typically do not have such protections. Electric and natural gas companies are usually regulated by the state and can be told not to shut people off while the state waits to receive its share of the LIHEAP money, Wolfe said. But it is different when it involves a small oil or propane company, fuels more common in the Northeast. “If you’re a heating oil dealer, we can’t tell that dealer, ‘Look, continue to provide heating oil to your low-income customers on the possibility you’ll get your money back,’” Wolfe said. Mark Bain, 67, who lives in Bloomfield, Connecticut, with his son, a student at the University of Connecticut, started receiving financial assistance for his home heating oil needs three years ago. “I remember the first winter before I knew about this program. I was desperate. I was on fumes,” said Bains, who is retired and relies on income from Social Security and a small annuity. “I was calling around to my social services people to find out what I could do.” He has been approved this year for $500 in assistance but he has a half tank of oil left and cannot call for more until it is nearly empty. By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it. He typically needs three deliveries to get through a winter. Bains said he can “get by” if he does not receive the help this year. “I would turn the heat down to like 62 (degrees) and throw on another blanket, you know, just to get through,” he said. ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Tiananmen vigil organizer’s attempt to quash her indictment, pressing ahead with a landmark case widely seen as part of a yearslong crackdown on the city’s pro-democracy movement. Chow Hang-tung, a former leader of the group that organized a decades-old vigil to remember China’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, was charged in 2021 with inciting subversion, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. She was charged together with two of the group’s other former leaders, Albert Ho and Lee Cheuk-yan. Their case was brought under a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 to quell massive anti-government protests in 2019. The trio were accused of inciting others to challenge the leadership of the Communist Party by unlawful means. Chow, who is a barrister and is defending herself, argued that the indictment was unacceptably broad and vague because authorities did not specify an unlawful means. She said it could amount to a “catch-all charge.” Judge Alex Lee remarked during the hearing that the charge was broad, but not vague. Related Stories The week golf in America goes quiet.

The three-judge panel, approved by the government to oversee the case, ruled against Chow. Lee said the panel would issue an opinion in January. Chow appeared calm when she learned about the decision and smiled to the public gallery before leaving the courtroom. The Tiananmen vigil, organized by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, was the only large-scale public commemoration of the 1989 crackdown in China for decades until authorities banned it in 2020, citing anti-pandemic measures. The group came under increasing pressure as police opened an investigation , accusing it of being a foreign agent. The group rejected the allegations and refused to cooperate . Chow, Ho and Lee were later charged for violations of the National Security Law. In 2021, the alliance’s members voted to disband . Chow and two other core members of the group were convicted in 2023 for failing to provide authorities with information and received a sentence of 4 1/2 months each. But in March, the trio overturned their convictions at the city’s top court, marking a rare court victory for the city’s pro-democracy activists. A trial in the national security case is set for Jan. 22. Since pandemic-era gathering restrictions were lifted, the park where the vigil was previously held has been occupied on the Tiananmen anniversary by a carnival showcasing Chinese food and products. Fernando Cheung, spokesperson for Amnesty International Hong Kong Overseas, said the court’s decision on Monday showed that the authorities were “weaponizing the overly broad concept of ‘national security’ to suppress freedom of expression with impunity.” “Commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown should never have been prosecuted,” he said, calling for the release of those detained for what he called peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression. The Hong Kong government insists that the city’s security law restored the city’s stability after the 2019 protests. ____ This version has been updated to correct the maximum penalty to 10 years, instead of life imprisonment."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"3102-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global events including NATO’s support of Ukraine with US weapons in response to Russian aggression, Trump’s accusations of nuclear testing by Russia, China, and Pakistan, the return of Xabi Alonso to Liverpool to renew the football rivalry with Real Madrid, Samia Suluhu Hassan’s landslide presidential victory in Tanzania, claims of secret nuclear tests by China and Russia, criticism of US actions toward Israel by former colonel Steve Gabavics, the cultural significance of Dia de Muertos in Mexico and beyond, Iran’s economic and diplomatic challenges, a suspected attack on a London-bound train injuring 11 people, and India’s historic victory in the women’s World Cup, drawing parallels to its 1983 men’s triumph.

nearest camp for displaced people in the days since Sudan’s paramilitary forces seized el-Fasher city, raising fears over tens of thousands who might still be trapped as survivors described killings and other atrocities, an aid group said Sunday. The Rapid Support Forces took control of the western Darfur region last week, after ousting the rival Sudanese army from the city that was besieged for 18 months. Since then, reports and videos have circulated of RSF atrocities against civilians including beatings, killings and sexual assaults, according to testimonies by civilians and aid workers. The dead included at least 460 killed in the hospital, according to the World Health Organization. The U.N. migration agency said Sunday it estimates that more than 8,000 people were displaced from el-Fasher on Saturday and Sunday. A total of 70,894 people have been displaced since the RSF took control, it said. However, less than 6,000 have made it to the nearest camp in Tawila, 65 kilometers (40 miles) away, said Shashwat Saraf, Sudan director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which runs the camp.

We are not seeing the hundreds of thousands that we were expecting. If people are still in el-Fasher, it will be very difficult for them to survive,” he told The Associated Press by phone from Tawila. Survivors describe dodging gunmen as they fled el-Fasher The fall of el-Fasher marked a new turning point in the war between the RSF and Sudan’s armed forces, which erupted in April 2023. More than 40,000 people have been killed, according to U.N. figures, but aid groups say the true number could be many times higher. The war has also displaced more than 14 million people and unleashed outbreaks of diseases, killing thousands. “We feel that a lot of people are stuck in locations from where it is not safe for them to move, and they need to pay to move and they don’t have money to pay,” Saraf said. Survivors who made the journey on foot have shared harrowing details of having to dodge gunmen shooting at them as they fled. “People arriving in the camp are mostly disoriented and dehydrated with bruises all over. Sometimes they do not even remember their names, they have to be taken to the hospital and have IV fluids,” Saraf said. Saraf also said that around 170 unaccompanied children, some of whom as young as 3 years old, trekked to Tawila without knowing where their family members were. They came along with older children or adults who were not their relatives. Sudan’s official accuses UAE of backing a “terrorist organization” In a news conference on Sunday, Sudan’s ambassador in Cairo, Imadeldin Mustafa Adawi, accused the RSF of carrying out war crimes in el-Fasher. Adawi said that his government would not negotiate with the RSF, urging the international community to designate the group as a terrorist organization. “The government of Sudan is calling on the international community to act immediately and effectively rather than just make statements of condemnation,” Adawi said. Adawi renewed his government’s accusations that the United Arab Emirates has been arming the RSF, insisting that the Gulf state should not be involved in any mediation efforts. The UAE has backed the RSF and opposed the Sudanese military, pointing to the army’s ties to Islamic forces that Abu Dhabi has long opposed. The UAE has denied the accusations despite evidence to the contrary. When asked earlier on Sunday about his country’s support for the RSF, senior UAE diplomat Anwar Gargash did not directly answer the question while attending the annual Manama Dialogue security summit in Bahrain. He said that the international community made a “critical mistake” in supporting both the military leader, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and his rival, RSF commander Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, when the army ousted a Western-backed power-sharing government in 2021. “We all made the mistake when the two generals who are fighting the civil war today overthrew the civilian government,” Gargash said. “That was, in my opinion, looking backward was a critical mistake. We should have put our foot down -- all of us collectively.” The UAE supports a three-month humanitarian ceasefire, with the two parties negotiating and a civilian transitional government formed in nine months, he said. There are mounting fears that the RSF may expand its military campaign toward the country’s center once again, buoyed by its seizure of the entire Darfur region. Twelve people were killed, including at least five children, in RSF attacks on two camps sheltering displaced people in the central Kordofan region, the Sudan Doctor Network, a medical group tracking the war, said on Saturday. ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Fay Abuelgasim in Cairo, Egypt contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/shutdown-snap-benefits-food-assistance-stigma-race-4bf5074c920e601e80e931cb5a22a784","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"14:08:19+00:00","title":"SNAP at Risk During Government Shutdown: Food Insecurity and Systemic Racism in the U.S.","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a federal government shutdown, two federal judges ruled that the Trump administration must continue funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the nation’s largest food aid program, using contingency funds.

YORK (AP) — In one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the nation, a line stretched along the side of the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen and Pantry. Willy Hilaire is homeless, unemployed and 63. He lives in a New York shelter with his two grandchildren and often goes hungry so that they can eat the food he gets from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , or SNAP. On many days, Hilaire’s only food is a hot meal he gets from Holy Apostles in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood. With SNAP at risk , he worries there won’t be enough for him and the children, forcing more sacrifice. “I always tell them, ‘Grandpa is there for you,’” he said. “‘Whatever I have, I’ll give it to you.’” Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown. But officials said it was too late to stop recipients from losing benefits on Saturday and that restoring them could likely take at least one week. Reliance on food aid hits Black people harder One in eight Americans use SNAP but its halt will disproportionately hurt Black Americans like Hilaire. Black people are 12.6% of the population but more than a quarter of SNAP recipients, the largest overrepresentation of any ethnic or racial group.. Other racial groups get SNAP at rates lower than their overall share of the population. Related Stories The Latest: Trump administration must tell judges whether it will feed the poor 7 MIN READ The Trump administration faces a Monday deadline to tell judges if it will fully fund SNAP 3 MIN READ Government shutdown threatens to delay home heating aid for millions of low-income families 5 MIN READ Historians and advocates say that’s an example of what’s known as systemic racism. There may be no formally racist policy at play but America’s long history of racism — from slavery to unfair zoning rules — has left Black communities with a series of structural disadvantages, and far less wealth accumulated over generations. Government shutdown The AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them? Non-Hispanic white people are 58.1% of the population but just 35.4% of SNAP recipients, the latest data show. Hispanic people and Asian people are underrepresented in the SNAP statistics. And Native Americans get SNAP at basically the same rate that their group is in the general population. Asian Americans living in poverty face constraints like lack of English fluency and neighborhood gentrification. In New York City, 253,000 of the 1.5 million Asian residents use SNAP, according to the nonprofit Asian American Federation. Over 91% of them work. But, with limited English proficiency, many are limited in their job opportunities, said CEO Catherine Chen. Families who have lived comfortably in cultural enclaves like Chinatown for one or two generations are getting priced out. Working, on food aid A majority of adult SNAP recipients who can work, do. Some still qualify for SNAP — typically $187 a month — despite holding down one or more jobs, according to nonprofit advocates. They’re often low-wage jobs without benefits like paid sick days. A report by the National Urban League last year found that the racial income gap has been virtually unchanged for more than 20 years, with Black Americans making 64% of the income of white people, on average. “There’s so much discrimination in the work force, so much discrimination in America today, that Black people who were enslaved and segregated for 350 years are still fighting for economic parity,” said Marc Morial, president of the civil rights group. “While we have a growing number of African American, middle-class Americans, we still have a disproportionate number of poor (Black) Americans.” At the current pace, it would take anywhere from one to three centuries for most Black Americans to achieve parity with their white peers, depending on where they live, according to the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility. Worsening statistics This year Black unemployment rose from 6.2% to 7.5%, the highest level since October 2021. Black homeownership fell to the lowest level in four years, according to an analysis by the real estate brokerage Redfin. The Census Bureau found the median Black household income fell 3.3% last year to $56,020. That’s around $36,000 less than what a white household earns. The looming absence of grocery dollars would almost certainly make it harder for families to afford rent, gas and other expenses. Even if SNAP benefits are restored before November ends, nonprofit leaders say low-income residents could face financial setbacks into next year. Tribal nations navigate a web of bureaucracy for food aid For tribal nations, food and nutrition assistance programs are part of the U.S. government’s trust and treaty responsibilities — the government’s legal and moral obligations to fund tribes’ health and well-being. The U.S. promised to uphold those rights in exchange for the land and resources it took from Indigenous peoples. However, those rights continue to be chronically underfunded and uniquely vulnerable to government shutdowns , according to a report released last week by the Brookings Institution. The study found that in 2024, more than two-thirds of trust and treaty responsibilities were funded through discretionary spending, meaning they are not guaranteed during a shutdown. It also noted that one of the largest sources of mandatory spending owed to tribes comes in the form of SNAP benefits. Another U.S. Department of Agriculture program that provides food to income-eligible Native American households , the Food Distribution Program in Indian Reservations, is still operating. But Native Americans already enrolled in SNAP cannot participate in that program. FDPIR President Mary Greene-Trottier said in October that her agency asked USDA Undersecretary Patrick Penn for a waiver, which the agency has granted for November, according to a letter Greene-Trottier received on Friday. She expects to see a substantial increase in demand for her program once SNAP benefits are shut off. “I’ve heard the pleas from the people in the community and outside the community that are just really concerned with not having enough food to eat and the choices between paying medical bills or utility bills that are increasing,” Greene-Trottier said. “I can’t say this loud enough, but this is the weaponization of food again,” she said, a reference to the U.S. government’s historic policies of withholding or cutting off food supplies to starve out tribal nations during the country’s expansion. Meanwhile, tribal nations across the country — including Spirit Lake Nation, Cherokee Nation, Blackfeet Nation, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Shawnee Tribe — declared states of emergency ahead of the loss of SNAP benefits. Misinformation drives stereotypes about SNAP recipients The disproportionate need for food stamps among non-white households has contributed to misinformation and stereotypes. Starting in the 1960s the term “welfare queen” became popular, playing to assumptions that poor people of color were profiting off government assistance rather than looking for work. But two-thirds of the over 40 million SNAP beneficiaries are people you wouldn’t expect to work. Thirty-nine percent are children, 20% are elderly and 10% are children or non-elderly adults with disabilities, according to the Urban Institute. Pastor Cleo Lewis, who usually conducts street ministry in Phoenix, organized a food drive for the first time to cushion the blow as much as possible for the 30 families he counsels at a local shelter “We usually are dealing with areas that are spiritually related,” Lewis said. “Now we’re having to increase our presence, and dealing with issues of substance and material issues that we know are significant, but we relied on other professionals to deal with this.” ___ This story has been corrected to state that the population percentage of non-Hispanic white people is 58.1%, not 75%, and to state that Asian SNAP recipients are underrepresented, not overrepresented. ___ Tang reported from Phoenix.

Thanksgiving Day Parade, which will also cement “KPop Demon Hunters” as a pop culture phenomenon with appearances by the movie’s singers on the ground and cute characters in balloons overhead. An eclectic group of stars — from ballet dancer Tiler Peck to YouTube’s “Hot Ones” host Sean Evans — will join the annual holiday kick-off, highlighted by Audrey Nuna, EJAE and Rei Ami of HUNTR/X, the fictional girl group at the heart of the Netflix K-pop hit. The trio are behind the film’s soundtrack, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and recently went platinum. Two characters from the movie — Derpy Tiger and Sussie — will join the parade lineup as a mid-sized balloon and the adorably named balloonicle. The parade will begin at 8:30 a.m. on Nov. 27 in all time zones and will feature 32 balloons, three ballonicles, 27 floats, 33 clown groups and 11 marching bands — all leading the way for Santa Claus. The familiar TV hosts — Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker from the “Today” show — will return on NBC and Peacock. More stars will be announced later. Broadway, Buzz Lightyear and Debbie Gibson Broadway will be represented by cast members from “Buena Vista Social Club,” “Just in Time” and “Ragtime,” while the Radio City Rockettes will be there and some serious athletes — three-time U.S. national champion figure skater Ilia Malinin and U.S Paralympian Jack Wallace. Every year, spectators line-up a half-dozen deep along the route to cheer the floats, entertainers and marching bands. Last year, more than 31 million people tuned in on NBC and Peacock, up 10% from the previous year and marking the biggest audience ever for the parade. This year, four new featured character balloons will debut, including Buzz Lightyear, Pac-Man, Mario from Super Mario Brothers and a 32-foot-tall (9.8-meter) balloon onion carriage featuring eight characters from the world of “Shrek.” Ahead of next year’s 100th anniversary of the parade, organizers are also including balloons from previous marches, including Rainbow trout, the Happy Hippo Triple Stack, Wigglefoot and Freida the Dachshund. Six new floats will also debut this year, including from Holland America Line, Lego, Lindt chocolates, “Stranger Things” and a bunch of whimsical sheep trying to get to sleep courtesy of Serta.

offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/death-toll-from-hurricane-melissa-climbs-to-49-with-many-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:15:49+00:00","title":"Death toll from Hurricane Melissa climbs to 49, with many still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, made landfall in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane, causing widespread destruction, killing 49 people across the Caribbean, and leaving hundreds of thousands without power.

It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials.

the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/drinking-water-in-tehran-could-run-dry-in-two-weeks-iranian-official-says","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"19:16:15+00:00","title":"Drinking water in Tehran could run dry in two weeks, Iranian official says","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iranian officials have warned that Tehran’s primary drinking water source, the Amir Kabir Dam, holds only 14 million cubic metres of water—just 8% of its capacity—putting the city’s water supply at risk for two weeks due to a historic drought.

for residents of the Iranian capital Tehran is at risk of running dry within two weeks, according to state media, due to a historic drought plaguing the country.\n\nThe Amir Kabir Dam, one of five that provide drinking water for Tehran, “holds just 14 million cubic metres of water, which is eight percent of its capacity”, the director of the capital’s water company, Behzad Parsa, was quoted as saying by the IRNA news agency on Sunday.\n\nAt that level, it can only continue to supply Tehran with water “for two weeks”, he warned.\n\nThe announcement comes as the country experiences its worst drought in decades. The level of rainfall in Tehran province was “nearly without precedent for a century”, a local official declared last month.\n\nThe megacity of more than 10 million people is nestled against the southern slopes of the often snow-capped Alborz Mountains, which soar as high as 5,600 metres (18,370 feet) and whose rivers feed multiple reservoirs.\n\nA year ago, the Amir Kabir dam held back 86 million cubic metres of water, Parsa said, but there had been a “100 percent drop in precipitation” in the Tehran region.\n\nParsa did not provide details on the status of the other reservoirs in the system.\n\nAccording to Iranian media, the population of Tehran consumes around three million cubic metres of water each day.\n\nAs a water-saving measure, supplies have reportedly been cut off to several neighbourhoods in recent days, while outages were frequent this summer.\n\nIn July and August, two public holidays were declared to save water and energy, with power cuts an almost daily occurrence amid  a heatwave  that saw temperatures rise beyond 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in Tehran and exceed 50C (122F) in some areas.\n\n“The water crisis is more serious than what is being discussed today,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned at the time.\n\nWater scarcity is a major issue throughout Iran, particularly in arid provinces in the country’s south, with shortages blamed on mismanagement and overexploitation of underground resources, as well as the growing impact of climate change.\n\nIran’s neighbour Iraq is  experiencing its driest year on record  since 1993, as the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, which flow into the Persian Gulf from West Asia, have seen their levels drop by up to 27 percent due to poor rainfall and upstream water restrictions, leading to a severe humanitarian crisis in the country’s south."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/melissa-leaves-50-dead-toll-expected-to-rise-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:03:28+00:00","title":"Melissa leaves 50 dead, toll expected to rise in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, devastated Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba in early 2025, killing around 50 people and causing catastrophic infrastructure damage.

and Cuba for days, leaving a trail of devastation that killed about 50 people.\n\nThe hurricane smashed into Jamaica with enormous force on Tuesday as a Category 5 storm, and residents were assessing their losses and the long road to recovery on Friday.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Jamaica remains without power, and nearly half of its water systems are offline.\n\nIn the historic seaside town of Black River, in southwest Jamaica, up to 90 percent of all structures were left without roofs, while the storm also snapped power lines and toppled concrete structures.\n\n“People are hungry,” said Monique Powell as she stood watch over a stash of groceries and household items for herself and a group of residents from Greenfield, one of many hurricane-torn communities on the outskirts of Black River.\n\n“Everything is gone,” said Michelle Barnes as she and her 13-year-old daughter secured their portion of handouts from local food establishments that were giving away their goods, many of which had become water-soaked and damaged.\n\nThe storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded, was made four times more likely because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by Imperial College London.\n\nJamaica’s Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon told a briefing that authorities had “quite credible” reports of a potential five additional deaths, but had not yet been able to confirm.\n\n“We’re still at 19 confirmed, but we do expect that will change today,” she said.\n\nIn nearby Haiti, authorities reported at least 31 people killed and 21 others missing, mostly in the country’s southern region. More than 15,800 people also remained in shelters.\n\nNo deaths were reported in Cuba as of Friday, where the civil defence evacuated more than 735,000 people across the eastern part of the island and where dangerous flooding continued in some areas on Friday.\n\nAlthough the full cost of Jamaica’s recovery is not yet known, the Caribbean country has allocated money for disaster response, including through a unique catastrophe bond arrangement with the World Bank.\n\nDixon said the bond, issued in 2024, provides Jamaica with $150m in financial protection for four hurricane seasons.\n\n“This bond, which provides payouts in the event of natural disasters until 2027, has been triggered by Hurricane Melissa,” she said on Friday.\n\nJamaica is  among many countries calling on wealthy nations to  increase climate financing  to help cover  the costs of climate-induced disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamaica’s Minister of Science, Energy and Technology Andrew Wheatley said that the country “deeply appreciates the global outpouring of support” in the wake of Melissa, but urged potential donors to be wary of scams and use the official government portal for donations.\n\nCuba was working on Friday to rescue residents still stranded by unprecedented floodwaters in the wake of Melissa.\n\nThe Cauto River overflowed its banks shortly after the Hurricane slammed into Cuba as a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, bringing upwards of 380mm (15 inches) of rain to some areas of the eastern end of the island.\n\nEmergency workers on Friday waded waist-deep in wetsuits and used boats and military vehicles to rescue residents from the still-rising waters of the country’s longest river.\n\nRio Cauto resident Eduardo Verdecia, 83, said he and his family had expected the river to subside, but continuing rains, plus run-off from nearby mountains and a fast-rising reservoir, had surprised them.\n\n“When night fell, we thought it would go down.

recorded more than 1,000 millimetres (39.4 inches) of rainfall over a 24-hour period ending late on Monday in parts of Hue and Hoi An.\n\nVietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said the volume of rainfall in Hue marked the highest ever for a 24-hour period since the country started its record-keeping.\n\nThe newspaper VNExpress reported that water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers, which flow through Hue, reached 5.25m (17.2 ft) on Monday afternoon, shattering the previous historical high recorded in 2020.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, water levels from both rivers have receded, but Hue remains submerged by more than one metre (3.3ft) of water.\n\nImages showed a wide area of the ancient city, including the palace grounds, under murky waters.\n\nAuthorities in Hue were quoted by the state news agency Vietnam News as saying that the rain and flooding may last until Friday.\n\nThe area was designated a world heritage site in 1993 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nThe heavy rain also triggered a massive landslide of red mud on Tuesday morning about 3km (1.9 miles) long in coastal Quang Ngai province, leaving about 1,700 people isolated, authorities said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, more than 8,600 people in four central provinces were evacuated due to risks from severe flooding and landslides.\n\nHeavy flooding has also forced the state-run Vietnam Railways Corp to suspend services between the capital Hanoi and the business hub Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe government said in a separate report that more than 306,000 households and businesses in Hue, Danang and Quang Tri provinces were suffering from blackouts.\n\nScientists warn that storms are becoming increasingly powerful as the planet warms due to human-induced climate change.\n\nThis month’s rainfall comes after  Typhoon Bualoi  battered the country in September, leaving at least 13 people dead and 20 others missing.\n\nAccording to the General Statistics Office, natural disasters — mostly storms, floods and landslides — left 187 people dead or missing in the country in the first nine months of 2025, with total economic losses estimated at more than $610m."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/israel-arrests-ex-army-lawyer-over-leaked-video-showing-palestinians-abuse","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:13:40+00:00","title":"Israel

scandal that erupted after she leaked a video, resigned and then disappeared.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the leaking of the video perhaps the most “severe public relations

Israel”, noting the spotlight on the leaker has overshadowed attention to the original crime.\n\n“There is so much focus on the fact that this video was leaked, at the expense of discussing how this crime actually happened – and the fact that the UN says that these kinds of crimes are being committed in a systematic manner,” Odeh said.\n\n“In one way, it’s a way to shift attention from the fact that these crimes are happening, by focusing on this woman and the fact that she leaked the video.”\n\nTomer-Yerushalmi disappeared for several hours on Sunday after she announced her resignation, sparking speculation of a possible suicide attempt.\n\nAccording to a copy of her resignation letter published by Israeli media on Friday, Tomer-Yerushalmi acknowledged that her office had released the video to the media last year. Five reservists were later charged with mistreating prisoners.\n\nNational Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said on Monday on Telegram: “It was agreed that in light of last night’s events, the prison service would act with extra vigilance to ensure the detainee’s safety in the detention centre where she has been placed in custody.”\n\nThe statement did not indicate what charges she faced.\n\nAccording to Israeli media, a Tel Aviv court ordered Tomer-Yerushalmi’s remand in custody until noon on Wednesday.\n\nPublic broadcaster Kan reported that she was suspected of “fraud and breach of trust, abuse of office, obstruction of justice and disclosure of information by a public servant”.\n\nFormer chief military prosecutor Colonel Matan Solomesh was also arrested overnight in connection with the case and was appearing in court Monday, reported Israeli Army Radio.\n\nOn Friday, the Israeli military announced that Tomer-Yerushalmi had resigned from her post pending an investigation into leaked footage taken at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel last year.\n\nThe case began in August 2024 when Israel’s Channel 12 broadcast footage from Sde Teiman, which has been used to hold Palestinians taken during the war in Gaza.\n\nThe surveillance camera footage indicated that soldiers had committed illicit acts, without explicitly showing it, as it appeared to take place behind troops holding up shields.\n\nThe video was picked up by several media outlets, triggering international outrage and protests within Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military said in February that it had filed charges against five reservist soldiers connected with mistreatment at Sde Teiman.\n\nThey were charged with “acting against the detainee with severe violence, including stabbing the detainee’s bottom with a sharp object, which had penetrated near the detainee’s rectum”.\n\nIt added “the acts of violence have caused severe physical injury to the detainee, including cracked ribs, a punctured lung and an inner rectal tear”.\n\nThe indictment said that the abuse took place on July 5, 2024 during a search of the detainee.\n\nSpeaking after a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu blasted the leak of the video, labelling it as perhaps the most “severe public relations attack” on Israel in the country’s history."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/landslides-in-kenyas-rift-valley-leave-21-dead-30-others-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"02:38:49+00:00","title":"Landslides in Kenya’s Rift Valley leave 21 dead, 30 others missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rains in Kenya’s western Rift Valley, specifically in the hilly Chesongoch area of Elgeyo-Marakwet County, triggered deadly landslides and flash floods on November 1, 2025, killing at least 21 people and leaving 30 missing.

any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center reveals that receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine before starting immunotherapy is associated with significantly improved survival rates in cancer patients, especially those with advanced or 'cold' tumors.

COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067258","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067201","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067270","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067291","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' discusses a powerful hurricane making landfall in Jamaica, described as a 'storm of the century,' but the content is incomplete and the page has been closed, leaving no verifiable details or factual content for analysis.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/uk-police-charge-man-with-11-counts-of-attempted-murder-over-train-stabbing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:23:03+00:00","title":"UK police charge man with attempted murder after train stabbings","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 32-year-old man from Peterborough, Anthony Williams, has been charged with multiple counts of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article after a mass stabbing on a London-bound train between Doncaster and King’s Cross Station.

Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/ukraine-receives-patriot-systems-to-bolster-air-defences-against-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"16:22:37+00:00","title":"Ukraine receives Patriot systems to bolster air defences against Russia","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine has received additional U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to counter Russian missile and drone attacks, which have killed thousands and targeted civilian infrastructure.

famine-stricken Sudan grinds eastwards\n\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has sent thousands more people fleeing in Sudan as it prepares a new offensive after atrocities committed during its assault on  el-Fasher in  the western  region of Darfur .\n\nThe United Nations warned in a report released late on Sunday of the humanitarian consequences as the paramilitary onslaught continues to forcibly displace thousands of people.\n\nThe RSF, led by  Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo , widely known as Hemedti, released a video on the same day, saying it is “amassing a large force, heralding the imminent liberation of el-Obeid”.\n\nThe state capital of North Kordofan in central Sudan lies east of Darfur, where the RSF killed and displaced thousands of people over the past week after seizing control of el-Fasher from government forces.\n\nThe Sudanese armed forces currently control el-Obeid. However, both sides have been gearing up for a major fight over the city.\n\nIn the RSF video, a soldier holding a weapon boasted that “all our forces have converged” on Bara, 50km (30 miles) northeast of el-Obeid.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM), in a report released on Sunday, estimated that on Friday alone, more than 1,200 people were displaced from Bara and Um Rawaba in North Kordofan.\n\nThis follows the displacement of 36,825 people from several localities in  North Kordofan  since last week.\n\nIn South Kordofan, IOM said field teams estimated 360 people were displaced from Abassiya and Delami towns on Saturday. Further displacement is expected as the situation remains “tense and highly fluid”, the UN agency said.\n\nAs the RSF and the army prepare for combat in el-Obeid, the  humanitarian situation  remains catastrophic across Sudan, especially in and around el-Fasher.\n\nUN teams estimated an additional 8,631 people were displaced from el-Fasher, the state capital of North Darfur, over the weekend. This means that more than 70,000 people have been displaced from the area since the RSF took over the last major city in Darfur on October 26, pushing out the Sudanese armed forces after an 18-month siege.\n\nStephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told reporters in New York on Friday that reports of “serious violations” including summary executions of several Red Crescent volunteers have emerged since the RSF’s takeover of Bara last week.\n\nTens of thousands of starving and desperate people are still trapped inside el-Fasher while the fate of several thousand who  fled but have not arrived in Tawila  or other nearby towns remains unknown.\n\nA video circulating online on Monday showed dozens of bodies strewn across roads surrounding el-Fasher.\n\nThe UN and international aid agencies have verified numerous accounts by survivors who said RSF fighters have engaged in mass executions, torture, rape and sexual abuse and holding people for ransom.\n\n“We have been hearing horror stories from many people arriving here, and those who were here weeks before the RSF took over el-Fasher. Some of them said they were stopped as they tried to leave the city under siege, and their relatives, especially males, were abducted and imprisoned by the RSF. Many here are mothers and children,” Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan said in a report from al-Dabbah city in northern Sudan.\n\n“Others say they have seen their relatives being killed on social media by the RSF. Some saw artillery strikes leaving headless and mutilated bodies.”\n\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, announced on Monday that famine has been detected in el-Fasher and Kadugli, located in South Kordofan.\n\nThe UN-backed global hunger monitor, which in August confirmed  famine spreading in Gaza , said 20 other areas in Darfur and Kordofan are also at serious risk of sliding into famine conditions.\n\nIt is estimated that 375,000 people were already living in famine conditions across Darfur and Kordofan as of September, while an additional 6.3 million people across the country are considered as suffering from extreme hunger and at risk of sliding into famine.\n\nMore Sudanese people will likely die of starvation and malnutrition without a ceasefire and safe humanitarian access, the IPC said.\n\nIn the Northern State, a large number of Sudanese have turned to al-Dabbah. Many of the people there have already been displaced several times, but some are packing up to leave once again for another refugee camp on the outskirts of the city because they fear the conflict may catch up with them in al-Dabbah.\n\n“The streets were full of dead bodies,” Yahya Abdullah, who barely escaped from el-Fasher along with his four children, told Al Jazeera from al-Dabbah. He had earlier lost his wife to an RSF drone strike.\n\nHe said RSF fighters shot at people, including children, in the streets of el-Fasher with machineguns. “I heard one of them say, ‘Kill them all.’”\n\nThe RSF is now actively under investigation for war crimes by the International Criminal Court (ICC), prosecutors of the court announced on Monday.\n\nThey said in a statement from The Hague that they are taking “immediate steps” in order to “preserve and collect relevant evidence for its use in future prosecutions” concerning crimes in el-Fasher following the capture of the city by the RSF.\n\nThe court described the atrocities as “part of a broader pattern of violence that has afflicted the entire Darfur region” and said that they “may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity”.\n\nThe specific types of crimes under investigation are ethnic-targeted attacks, sexual violence including use of rape as a weapon, abductions, indiscriminate attacks on civilians, and attacks on medical facilities.\n\nIn a  briefing in June , ICC Deputy Prosecutor Nazhat Shameem Khan said there are “reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been and are continuing to be committed in Darfur”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched its first national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025 to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14, aiming to combat cervical cancer, which kills eight women daily.

papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/uk-train-stabbing-attack-how-it-unfolded-and-what-we-know-now","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"13:37:10+00:00","title":"UK train stabbing attack – how it unfolded and what we know now","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A mass stabbing occurred on a train traveling from Doncaster to London’s King’s Cross station on November 1, 2025, during which 11 people were injured.

London in the United Kingdom descended into chaos on Saturday night, when passengers were attacked in a  mass stabbing  inside the train.\n\nEleven people received treatment in hospital following the attack. One of them, a train worker, remains in critical condition after he protected passengers from the knifeman. He was hailed as a “hero” by police and also praised  by Heidi Alexander, the UK’s transport secretary, who said: “He put himself in harm’s way and there are people who are alive today who wouldn’t be alive had it not been for his actions.”\n\nPolice initially arrested two suspects, but later released one, saying he had not been involved. On Monday, the suspect who remains in custody was named as 32-year-old Anthony Williams, from Peterborough, who is also being held on suspicion of attempted murder at a location in London earlier on Saturday.\n\nPolice are still working to uncover a motive for the attack, but said it did not appear to be an act of “terrorism”.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer called the attack an “appalling incident” that was “deeply concerning”, while Interior Minister Shabana Mahmood said she was “saddened” and urged people to avoid comment and speculation.\n\nDowning Street is keen to quell rumours spreading online following an incident in Southport in 2024, when the murder of three young girls sparked  days of riots  across the country.\n\nThe train left Doncaster in northern England at 16:25 GMT on Saturday, November 1, bound for London’s King’s Cross station.\n\nIt had just departed from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, roughly halfway into its two-hour journey, when police began receiving calls alerting them that people were being stabbed on board.\n\nPassengers described panicked travellers, some covered in blood, rushing down the aisle of the train to get away from the perpetrator, who witnesses reported as wielding a “large knife”.\n\nOne man is understood to have been wounded as he tried to shield a woman and a young child. Other passengers locked themselves in train toilets.\n\nThe British Transport Police, which handles security on the UK’s railway network, said it received its first emergency call at 19:42 GMT.\n\nSoon after, the train made an unscheduled stop at Huntingdon station – about 120km (75 miles) north of London. Passengers spilled onto the platform as armed police boarded the train.\n\nPolice said that 10 people were taken to nearby hospitals, and that an 11th went to a hospital on their own. Nine were initially classed as having life-threatening injuries.\n\nBy Sunday night, police said only one remained in a life-threatening condition: a railway staff member who tried to stop the attack. Police called his actions “nothing short of heroic”.\n\nIt is believed so. A rail staff member intervened during the incident by shielding passengers from the assailant. The train worker suffered life-threatening injuries in the process, police said.\n\nThe member of the London North Eastern Railway staff could be seen on CCTV, attempting to stop the attacker as the train travelled from Peterborough.\n\nMeanwhile, the driver who stopped the train at Huntingdon was said to be “very shaken” but “good”. Named as Andrew Johnson, he was reported to be a Royal Navy veteran.\n\nOn Sunday, Johnson, who is from Peterborough, told ITV News: “I was only doing my job.” He added, “It was my colleague who is in hospital who was the brave one”.\n\nBritish Transport Police said that within minutes of the first emergency calls, Cambridgeshire Constabulary officers, the local police, had boarded the train and detained two men.\n\nPolice later released one of the men, a 35-year-old British citizen, without charge, saying they had established that he was not involved in the attack.\n\nThe remaining suspect is a 32-year-old British man. On Monday, British Transport Police named him as Anthony Williams, from Peterborough.\n\nWilliams has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of a bladed article, by Peterborough Magistrates’ Court.\n\nHe has also been charged with another count of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article in connection with a separate incident at Pontoon Dock station in the Docklands, East London, on Saturday.\n\nPolice superintendent John Loveless said that counter-terrorism police were initially called, but that “at this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident”.\n\nHe said that an investigation is being led by British Transport Police, and “it would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause of this incident”.\n\nStill, that did not stop conspiracy theories from swirling around on social media over the weekend. Far-right social media accounts have attempted to exploit the incident.\n\nAn X account called “British Patriot”, which has nearly 5,000 followers, posted an unsubstantiated claim that the man on the train had been shouting “Allahu akbar” (“God is the greatest”, in Arabic).\n\nAnd even after police revealed that the two arrested suspects were British nationals, attempts were made to suggest that pertinent information about their origins was being withheld.\n\nBen Habib, the former Reform UK co-leader, said that, in his mind, it was “almost inconceivable” that the incident was not an act of “terrorism”.\n\nHe added it was “possible” the suspects were British, but said that until police had released their names, “I will remain extremely suspicious until we get chapter and verse”.\n\nOver the past decade, the number of serious crimes involving knives – including homicides – has climbed in the UK.\n\nAccording to the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of serious offences in England and Wales involving a knife or sharp object recorded in the year ending March 2024 was 54 percent higher – a jump of nearly 22,000 cases – than the figure for 2016.\n\nWhile stabbings tend to be concentrated among young people in specific urban places such as London and Manchester, they have drawn public attention and policy responses.\n\nExperts generally agree that issues such as unsupported mental health problems and years of funding cuts to social services have made certain sections of the UK’s youth population more prone to knife crime.\n\nAccording to an August report by the Youth Justice Board, an independent public body, “knife crime is driven by a combination of poverty, marginalisation, adverse childhood experiences, trauma, fear and victimisation, including exploitation”.\n\nSerious knife crime has tapered off in recent months. The ONS reports that the number of serious offences in England and Wales involving knives in the year ending March 2025 had fallen by one percent to 53,047, compared with the previous year.\n\nIn August, the Labour government implemented a new law seeking to crack down on the sale of ninja and samurai swords by making it illegal to manufacture, import, sell or possess (even in private) these weapons.\n\nFor his part, London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan has come in for criticism for failing to stop knife crime under his tenure, which began in 2016.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2024, knife crime rose by 23 percent in London, according to Metropolitan Police and ONS data.\n\nHowever, new London City Hall data shows that knife crime dropped by 19 percent between April and June of this year, compared with the same period last year.\n\nOver the summer, Khan pledged a police funding blitz to tackle shoplifting, robbery, knife crime, and antisocial behaviour in London’s 20 most blighted town centres."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/key-takeaways-from-trumps-60-minutes-interview","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"15:25:36+00:00","title":"Key takeaways from Trump’s 60 Minutes interview","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent 60 Minutes interview hosted by Norah O’Donnell, U.S. President Donald Trump addressed a wide range of contentious issues, including allegations of deceptive editing by CBS, the resumption of nuclear testing, the ongoing government shutdown, immigration crackdowns, trade wars with China, and military actions in Venezuela and the Middle East.

Trump has appeared on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes just months after he won a $16m settlement from the broadcaster for alleged “deceptive editing”.\n\nIn the interview with CBS host Norah O’Donnell, which was filmed last Friday at his Mar-a-Lago residence and aired on Sunday, Trump touched on several topics, including the ongoing government shutdown, his administration’s unprecedented crackdowns on undocumented migrants, the US’s decision to restart nuclear testing, and the trade war with China.\n\nTrump, who regularly appears on Fox News, a right-wing media outlet, has an uneasy relationship with CBS, which is considered centrist.\n\nIn October 2020, the president walked out of a 60 Minutes interview in the lead-up to the 2020 election he lost, claiming that the host, Lesley Stahl, was “biased”.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the interview:\n\nThe president’s lawyers sued CBS owner Paramount in October 2024 for “mental anguish” over a pre-election interview with rival candidate Kamala Harris that Trump claimed had been deceptively edited to favour Democrats and thus affected his campaign.\n\nCBS had aired two different versions of an answer Harris gave to a question on Israel’s war on Gaza, posed by host Bill Whitaker. One version aired on 60 Minutes while the other appeared on the programme Face the Nation.\n\nAsked whether Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, listened to US advice, Harris answered: “We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States – to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.”\n\nIn an alternative edit, featured in earlier pre-broadcast promotions, Harris had given a longer, more rambling response that did not sound as concise.\n\nThe network argued the answer was edited differently for the two shows due to time restrictions, but Trump’s team claimed CBS “distorted” its broadcasts and “helped” Harris, thereby affecting his campaign. Trump asked for an initial $10bn in damages before upping it to $20bn in February 2025.\n\nParamount, in July 2025, chose to settle with Trump’s team to the tune of $16m in the form of a donation to a planned Trump presidential library. That move angered journalist unions and rights groups, which argued it set a bad precedent for press freedom.\n\nParamount executives said the company would not apologise for the editing of its programmes, but had decided to settle to put the matter to rest.\n\nThe company was at the time trying to secure federal approval from Trump’s government for a proposed merger with Skydance, owned by Trump ally Larry Ellison. The Federal Communications Commission has since approved the merger that gives Ellison’s Skydance controlling rights.\n\nOn October 19, Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, US special envoy to the Middle East, were interviewed on 60 Minutes regarding the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nAfter meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea  last Thursday, Trump praised his counterpart as a “strong man, a very powerful leader” and said their relationship was on an even keel despite the trade war. However, he blamed China for “ripping off” the US through its dominance of crucial rare earth materials.\n\nTrump told 60 Minutes he had cut a favourable trade agreement with China and that “we got – no rare-earth threat. That’s gone, completely gone”, referring to Chinese export restrictions on critical rare-earth metals needed to manufacture a wide range of items including defence equipment, smartphones and electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, Beijing actually only said it would delay introducing export controls for five rare-earth metals it announced in October, and did not mention restrictions on a further  seven it announced in April this year . Those restrictions remain in place.\n\nTrump said President Xi did not say anything about whether Beijing planned to attack autonomous Taiwan.\n\nHowever, he referred to past assurances from Xi, saying: “He [Xi] has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, ‘We would never do anything while President Trump is president’, because they know the consequences.”\n\nAsked whether he would order US forces to action if China moved  militarily on Taiwan,  Trump demurred, saying: “You’ll find out if it happens, and he understands the answer to that … I can’t give away my secrets. The other side knows.”\n\nThere are mounting fears in the US that China could attack Taiwan. Washington’s stance of “strategic ambiguity” has always kept observers speculating about whether the US would defend Taiwan against Beijing. Ahead of the last elections, Trump said Taiwan should “pay” for protection.\n\nWhen asked why he pardoned cryptocurrency multibillionaire and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao last month, Trump said: “I don’t know who he is.”\n\nThe president said he had never met Zhao, but had been told he was the victim of a “witch hunt” by the administration of former US President Joe Biden.\n\nZhao pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering in connection with child sex abuse and “terrorism” on his crypto platform in 2023. He served four months in prison until September 2024, and stepped down as chief executive of Binance.\n\nBinance has been  linked  to the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company World Liberty Financial, and many have questioned if the case is a conflict of interest.\n\nIn March 2025, World Liberty Financial launched its own dollar-pegged cryptocoin, USD1, on Binance’s blockchain and the company promoted it to its 275 million users. The coin was also supported by an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates, MGX Fund Management Limited, which used $2bn worth of the World Liberty stablecoin to buy a stake in Binance.\n\nThis part of the interview appeared in a full transcript of the 90-minute interview, but does not appear in either the 28-minute televised version or the 73-minute extended online video version. CBS said in a note on the YouTube version that it was “condensed for clarity”.\n\nTrump justified last week’s decision by his government to  resume nuclear testing  for the first time in 33 years, saying that other countries – besides North Korea – are already doing it.\n\n“Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it,” Trump said, also mentioning Pakistan. “You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are gonna report – they don’t have reporters that gonna be writing about it. We do.”\n\nRussia, China, and Pakistan have not openly conducted tests in recent years. Analyst Georgia Cole of UK think tank Chatham House told Al Jazeera that “there is no indication” the three countries have resumed testing.\n\nThe president claimed the US-negotiated ceasefire and peace plan between Israel and Hamas was “very solid” despite Israeli strikes  killing 236 Gazans  since the ceasefire went into effect. It is also unclear whether or when the Palestinian armed group, Hamas, has agreed it will disarm.\n\nHowever, Trump said he was not worried about Hamas disarming as the US would force the armed group to do so. “Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don’t behave,” he said.\n\nTrump denied the US was going to war with Venezuela despite a US military build-up off the country’s coast and  deadly air strikes  targeting alleged drug-trafficking ships in the country’s waters. The United Nations has said the strikes are a violation of international law.\n\nResponding to a question about whether the strikes were really about unseating Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro, Trump said they weren’t. However, when asked if Maduro’s days in office were numbered, the president answered: “I would say, yeah.”\n\nTrump, a member of the Republican Party, blamed Democrats for what is now close to the longest government shutdown in US history, which has been ongoing since October 1.\n\nSenators from the Democratic Party have refused to approve a new budget unless it extends expiring tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans and unless Trump reverses healthcare cuts made in his tax-and-spending bill, passed earlier this year.\n\nThe US president made it clear that he would not negotiate with Democrats, and did not give clear plans for ending the shutdown affecting 1.4 million governent employees.\n\nReferring to a US Supreme Court hearing brought by businesses arguing that the Trump government’s tariff war on other countries is illegal and has caused domestic inflation, Trump said the US “would go to hell” and be a “third world nation” if the court ordered tariffs to be removed.\n\nHe said the tariffs are necessary for “national security” and that they have increased respect from other countries for the US.\n\nTrump defended his government’s unprecedented Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  raids  and surveillance on people perceived to be undocumented migrants.\n\nWhen asked if the raids had gone too far, he responded: “No. I think they haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by [former US Presidents Joe] Biden and [Barack] Obama.”\n\nRegarding the New York City mayoral race scheduled for November 4, Trump said he would not back democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, and called him a “communist”. He said if Mamdani wins, it will be hard for him to “give a lot of money to New York”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/thousands-evacuated-as-typhoon-kalmaegi-approaches-the-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:20:14+00:00","title":"Thousands evacuated as Typhoon Kalmaegi approaches the Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi is expected to land in the eastern Philippines, primarily in Guiuan or nearby coastal towns, on Monday, November 3, 2025.

Shops were shuttered along nearly empty streets, with most people remaining at home.\n\nA total internet blackout has been in place since the protests broke out on election day.\n\nChadema, Tanzania’s main opposition party, which was barred from running, has rejected the results, branding the vote a “sham” and calling for new elections.\n\n“These results have no basis in reality, as the truth is that no genuine election took place in Tanzania,” the party’s statement read.\n\nThe anger over the election persists, as well as the resulting violence.\n\nChadema asserted late last week that  hundreds of people had been killed  after demonstrators clashed with police, which reportedly fired tear gas and live ammunition as government buildings were set on fire.\n\nThe party suggested on Saturday that as many as 800 people had been killed across the country.\n\nA diplomatic source told the AFP news agency there were credible reports of hundreds – perhaps even thousands – of deaths registered at hospitals and health clinics around Tanzania.\n\nThe source added that there were “concerning reports” that police were using the internet blackout to buy time as they “hunt down opposition members and protesters who might have videos” of atrocities committed last week.\n\nAl Jazeera has been unable to independently verify the number of deaths.\n\nThe United Nations human rights office said credible reports indicated at least 10 people were killed in three cities.\n\nTanzania’s Foreign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo denied that “excessive force” has been used, telling Al Jazeera the government has “no official figures” on any protesters killed.\n\nHassan, previously vice president, took office four years ago when her predecessor, John Magufuli, died in office.\n\nShe has faced rising criticism for what the UN has called a pattern of “escalating” attacks, disappearances and torture of critics, since.\n\nLocal and international watchdogs have sounded alarms over election-related violence and repression for months, helping to support suggestions by analysts that she wanted an emphatic victory to cement her place and silence critics within the governing party.\n\nRights groups say she oversaw a “wave of terror” before the vote, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days.\n\nThe election saw her  two biggest challengers excluded  from the race.

The 34-year-old state assemblyman has called the former New York governor a puppet and parrot of Trump.\n\n\"The answer to a Donald Trump presidency is not to create its mirror image here in City Hall,\" Mamdani said on Monday.\n\n\"It is to create an alternative that can speak to what New Yorkers are so desperate to see in their own city and what they find in themselves and their neighbours every day - a city that believes in the dignity of everyone who calls this place home.\"\n\nCuomo has sought to parry that line of attack by presenting himself as the only candidate experienced enough to deal with the Trump administration.\n\nHe was governor of New York during the Covid-19 pandemic when many states clashed with the Trump administration, though Cuomo himself came under scrutiny after state investigators found nursing home deaths were significantly understated during the outbreak.\n\n\"I fought Donald Trump,\" Cuomo said during a debate. \"When I'm fighting for New York, I am not going to stop.\"\n\nTrump has deployed National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities as part of a crime crackdown, while seeking to strip funding from jurisdictions that limit their co-operation with federal immigration authorities."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq01zn52z4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:29:00.206+00:00","title":"George Clooney says replacing Biden with Harris 'was a mistake'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"George Clooney has criticized the 2024 Democratic decision to replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris, calling it a 'mistake' due to the difficulty Harris would face in running against her own political record.

2025\n\nOman has for years acted as a  mediator between Iran and the US  in nuclear, financial, prisoner exchange and other regional issues.\n\nTehran and Washington were slated to sit down for a sixth round of talks in mid-June, when  Israel attacked Iran’s nuclear facilities . That launched a 12-day war that killed more than 1,000 people in Iran and inflicted billions of dollars in infrastructure damage.\n\nAfter media reports last week said the administration of US President Donald Trump had sent a new message to Tehran via Oman, Iran’s government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani confirmed that messages had been received.\n\nBut she did not elaborate on the content or Iran’s potential response. The White House has not publicly confirmed sending the missive.\n\nDuring his interview, Araghchi said “almost all” of the about 400kg (880lb) of 60-percent enriched uranium possessed by Iran is “buried under the rubble” of  nuclear facilities bombed by the US  and Israel.\n\n“We have no intention of removing them from under the rubble until conditions are ready. We have no information on how much of the 400kg is untouched and how much is destroyed, and we will have no information until we dig them out,” he said.\n\nThe Iranian foreign minister pointed out that China and Russia have formally announced  they do not recognise the UN sanctions  recently reimposed against Iran by the European signatories to its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.\n\nFrance, the United Kingdom and Germany have signalled they want to restart talks with Tehran. However, no substantial progress has been made.\n\nIn the meantime, they have imposed sanctions and restrictions, both in relation to Iran’s alleged  drone exports to Russia  and its nuclear programme.\n\nThe three European powers in September announced they were suspending their bilateral air services agreements with Iran, affecting Iranian carriers like Iran Air.\n\nSome of the flights appear to be gradually coming back, though, with Iranian state television airing footage of an Austrian Airlines flight landing in Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport on Sunday night.\n\nGermany’s Lufthansa is also scheduled to resume flights to Tehran, but the precise restart date has not been publicly announced."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/jamaica-braces-as-hurricane-melissa-strengthens-offshore","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"06:45:50+00:00","title":"Officials warn Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, is approaching Jamaica with a slow movement of just 7km/h, increasing the risk of catastrophic flooding, landslides, and storm surges.

urged to take shelter as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c986npp638qo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:39:25.692+00:00","title":"Justin Baldoni case against Blake Lively dismissed after deadline lapse","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from allegations of sexual harassment and a smear campaign related to their 2024 film 'It Ends with Us', was formally dismissed by Judge Lewis Liman due to Baldoni's failure to file an amended complaint by the deadline.

Trump has authorised the deployment of the CIA to Venezuela and the world's largest aircraft carrier is being sent to the region.\n\nMaduro has previously accused Washington of \"fabricating a new war\", while Colombian President Gustavo Petro has said the strikes on boats are being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.\n\nTrump said the government was \"not going to allow\" people \"from all over the world\" to come in.\n\n\"They come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular - has been bad. They have gangs,\" he said, singling out Tren de Aragua.\n\nHe called it \"the most vicious gang anywhere in the world\".\n\nTrump was also  asked about nuclear testing , after he  called on US military leaders to resume testing nuclear weapons  in order to keep pace with other countries such as Russia and China.\n\nAsked by CBS's Norah O'Donnell if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years, Trump said: \"I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.\"\n\nHowever,  Energy Secretary Chris Wright sought to calm global concerns  by telling Fox News the US was not planning to conduct nuclear explosions.\n\nDuring his CBS interview, Trump also spoke about  the US government shutdown , which has gone on for more than a month and left millions of Americans facing the loss of essential services.\n\nThe president blamed Democrats, calling them \"crazed lunatics\" who have \"lost their way\" - but said he believed they would eventually capitulate and vote to end the shutdown.\n\n\"And if they don't vote, that's their problem,\" he said.\n\nIt was Trump's first interview with CBS  since he sued its parent company, Paramount,  over a 2024 interview with then Vice-President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe said the interview - which aired as part of the presidential election campaign - had been edited to \"tip the scales in favour of the Democratic Party\".\n\nParamount agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle the suit, but with the money allocated to Trump's future presidential library, not paid to him \"directly or indirectly\". It said the settlement did not include a statement of apology.\n\nTrump last appeared on the 60 Minutes programme in 2020, when he walked out of an interview with Lesley Stahl because he claimed the questions were biased. He did not agree to an interview with the show during the 2024 election.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

Meanwhile President Trump’s $250M ballroom is coming out of his own pocket. pic.twitter.com/PSS2K8SJRJ\n\n— aka (@akafaceUS)  October 25, 2025\n\nObama was president during a White House renovation. But differences between that project and Trump’s project are significant.\n\nCongress in 2008 approved funding for White House work after a government report produced during President George W Bush’s second term found the building needed upgrades to its water pipes and electrical systems, CNN reported in 2010. The changes improved heating, cooling and fire alarm systems that hadn’t been updated since 1902 or 1934.\n\nBob Peck, then commissioner of the US General Services Administration’s Public Buildings Service, told CNN in 2010 that the White House sometimes experienced power outages and leaky pipes.\n\nObama’s underground renovations affected mainly the building’s interior.\n\nSeparately, the Obamas in 2009 updated and redecorated the White House’s interior without using taxpayer money. The New York Times reported in 2020 that the White House’s new furnishings were paid for largely with Obama’s book royalties and donations. Obama also adapted the White House tennis court so it could be used as a basketball court.\n\nTrump’s East Wing demolition and ballroom addition have not been approved by the federal agency that oversees federal building construction and renovations. Trump said the project aims to expand the East Wing’s seating capacity from 200 people to 999.\n\nThe White House originally said the project would cost  $200m , but Trump has since said it will be $300m, funded by donations.  Donors  include individuals and corporations such as Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, The Washington Post reported.\n\n“It’s unprecedented, in all the wrong ways, including that the American public has been kept totally in the dark about the President’s plans,” said Sara Bronin, Freda H Alverson professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.\n\nPriya Jain, chair of the Society of Architectural Historians’ Heritage Conservation Committee, pushed back against calling Trump’s project a renovation. “This project involves total destruction of a large part of the building,” she said.\n\nThe Obama-era renovation started in 2010 with an estimated $376m cost to improve the East and West Wings’ infrastructure, CNN reported in 2010.\n\nPeck described the project as largely underground utility work. “It doesn’t do a whole lot of good to have a building that’s the sort of the image of the free world standing up there and not functioning well,” Peck told CNN when questioned about the cost.\n\nBloomberg News reported in 2010 that the Obama renovation was the biggest White House upgrade since President Harry Truman was in office. From 1948 to 1952, Truman oversaw the White House’s historic gutting, renovation and expansion in response to significant structural issues that at one point resulted in the leg of his daughter’s piano breaking through the floor.\n\nTrump’s project will be the first major exterior change of the White House in 83 years, historic preservationists say.\n\n“Such a significant change to a historic building of this import should follow a rigorous and deliberate design and review process,” the Society of Architectural Historians said in an October 16 statement.\n\nSince taking office a second time, Trump has also added gold highlights inside the Oval Office and paved over the Rose Garden lawn. The National Park Service oversaw the Rose Garden project.\n\nAt a September meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission – the federal agency that oversees  federal building  construction and renovations – the Trump-appointed commission chair Will Scharf said the agency has no jurisdiction over “demolition and site preparation work”, only over construction and “vertical build”. The commission was expected to meet on November 6, but it’s unclear whether that will happen if the federal government shutdown continues.\n\nPolitiFact looked at the National Planning Commission’s Project Search for approval records of the Obama renovations, but the database doesn’t have records before January 2012. We reached out to the commission to ask if they approved the 2010 renovations, but received no response because of their closure.\n\nThe White House is exempt from Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which says that each federal agency must consider public views and concerns about historic preservation when making final project decisions. Michael Spencer, an associate professor in the University of Mary Washington’s historic preservation department said presidents have nevertheless typically undertaken White House projects in the spirit of public transparency. The National Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts approved Trump’s first-term term tennis facility alterations, for example.\n\n“Most importantly, none of these projects involved demolition of existing historic buildings,” Jain said.\n\nThe East Colonnade and East Wing were built in 1902 and 1942, respectively, and, under National Park Service guidelines, should have been assessed for historic significance before being demolished, she said.\n\nPolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev18k70zkyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"13:09:46.721+00:00","title":"Mississippi mum says she shot dead one of remaining escaped monkeys","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 35-year-old mother, Jessica Bond Ferguson, shot one of several escaped Rhesus monkeys in Mississippi after her 16-year-old son alerted her to its presence in their backyard.

Trump administration to fund food aid\n\nMore than 42 million Americans are waiting with bated breath to hear if the Trump administration will use emergency funding to provide billions in food aid.\n\nJudges gave the Trump administration until Monday at 12:00 EST (17:00 GMT) to give updates about how it plans to pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits, also known as food stamps.\n\nFunding for the program remains in limbo due to the more-than-month-long US government shutdown caused by the inability of Congress to agree on a funding deal.\n\nRegardless of the judges' ruling or other resolution, millions of Americans have gone without essential food assistance since funding for the program ran dry on Saturday.\n\nWhile individual US states administer the benefits, the programme relies on money from the federal government, which has been unfunded and shut down since 1 October.\n\nFederal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) needs to use $5.25bn (£4bn) in emergency funds to make at least partial payments to Americans on Snap.\n\nSnap costs about $8bn per month.\n\nThe judges both gave the Trump administration the option to use money set aside for contingencies to provide the benefits.\n\nUS President Donald Trump previously said he had instructed government lawyers to ask the courts how the administration could legally fund Snap, adding: \"Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a CNN interview that the president wanted to hear from the courts about how to legally move money around to fund Snap payments but they could go out as soon as Wednesday.\n\n\"There's a process that has to be followed,\" Bessent said. \"So, we've got to figure out what the process is.\"\n\nLate last month, the USDA said it will not distribute food assistance funds starting 01 November because of the government shutdown, saying: \"The well has run dry\".\n\nHalf the states and the District of Columbia sued the administration over the food-aid freeze and contended that they have a legal obligation to keep the program running in their jurisdictions.\n\nSeparately, cities and non-profits also filed a lawsuit.\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding federal Snap funding, some states said they would use their own money to fund Snap benefits.\n\nSnap plays a vital role allowing many low-income Amerians to buy groceries. It provides them reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy food.\n\nA family of four on average receives $715 per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 per day, per person."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyklpy88lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"07:32:37.639+00:00","title":"Five moments that defined India's women's World Cup glory","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India achieved its first-ever Women's World Cup victory by defeating South Africa by 52 runs in a dramatic final at DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai.

history had finally caught up with promise.\n\nIt's been a campaign of redemption and resilience. From three straight defeats in the group stage to a flawless knockout run, India's turnaround was as dramatic as it was defining.\n\nFor a cricket-mad nation long waiting for its women to stand shoulder to shoulder with its men, this triumph felt epochal - the spark of a new era. Here are the five moments that shaped India's road to glory.\n\nIt was an unexpected move that stunned everyone.\n\nShafali Verma - playing only because regular opener Pratika Rawal was injured - is a part-time spinner in the  Virender Sehwag  mould.\n\nYet she struck gold, removing Sune Luus with her second ball and Marizanne Kapp with her seventh, halting South Africa's chase in its tracks.\n\nAfter the match, skipper Harmanpreet Kaur said she'd gone with her gut - \"it felt like her day.\" Having earlier smashed 87, Verma fittingly took home the Player of the Match award.\n\nSouth Africa's opener and captain Laura Wolvaardt had been the pre-eminent batter in the tournament, not only leading the run-scorer's list, but also slamming a century in the semi-final to knock out England.\n\nIn the final, she threatened to do the same against India with another magnificent century.\n\nWith 78 needed, Wolvaardt went for broke - but her lofted hit off Deepti Sharma was skied to long-on. Amanjot Kaur, the 25-year-old daughter of a carpenter from Punjab, sprinted in, juggled thrice, and finally clung on in a tumbling catch that sent the stadium - and India - roaring.\n\nWolvaardt stood between India and victory. Amanjot had held her nerve, and the catch for dear life. The path to victory had been cleared.\n\nOn a dewy night, Jemimah Rodrigues powered India to one of the greatest chases in women's cricket to reach the World Cup final.\n\nHer unbeaten 127 in the semi-final against Australia was the very definition of a tour de force.\n\nPromoted to No 3, Jemimah played the innings of a lifetime, steering India past a record target against their long-time nemesis - the Australians who had thwarted India's ICC dreams for over a decade.\n\nHer innings was a masterclass in building a match-winning knock under pressure.\n\nWalking in after two early wickets - including the prolific mainstay Smriti Mandhana - she steadied the innings with superb technique, sharp match awareness, and bursts of flair. Her 167-run stand with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur became the bedrock of India's record run chase.\n\nThe most compelling aspect of Jemimah's amazing innings was the  mental and emotional setbacks  she had to overcome before and during the tournament, including being dropped for a match. She finished the match in tears of redemption and everlasting glory.\n\nJemimah's innings helped India hunt down a record 338 in a pulsating edge-of-the-seat finish - winning by five wickets with five balls to spare.\n\nA touch below her best with the bat - though her crucial 89 against Australia powered India into the final - Harmanpreet's true impact lay in her leadership.\n\nComposed, tactical, and fearless, she was the steady hand that guided India through the pressure of knockout cricket.\n\nUnder intense scrutiny after three straight defeats mid-tournament, Harmanpreet rallied her team with calm authority - regrouping swiftly and brilliantly through a series of bold, inspired calls.\n\nBringing Jemimah back into the XI - a move widely criticised at the time -  was vindication enough.\n\nBut promoting her to No 3 was the masterstroke that transformed India's campaign.  A fluent half-century against New Zealand, a rousing century in the semi-final against Australia, and a vital knock in the final cemented Jemimah's role as the pivot around which India's batting thrived.\n\nBacking Shafali Verma to bowl in a tense final was an inspired call - a gamble, perhaps, but one that paid off handsomely.\n\nThrough the pressure of the semi-final and final, Harmanpreet's composure never wavered. Unflustered and astute, she held the team together with smart, timely decisions.\n\nDeepti Sharma ended the tournament as its leading wicket-taker -  a feat remarkable in itself, yet only half the story of her impact.\n\nHer crucial runs in the knockout matches were just as vital, making her one of the true architects of India's title triumph.\n\nAgainst Australia, Deepti turned the game twice over - first with a double strike in a tense closing spell that likely saved 15–20 runs, then with a spirited, attacking 24 that kept India's pulsating chase on track.\n\nIn the final against South Africa, Deepti went one better - a run-a-ball 58 that powered India past 250, followed by a stunning 5 for 39. It was one of the finest all-round performances in World Cup history - men's or women's."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jrw12d3edo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"08:29:10.666+00:00","title":"At least 20 dead after magnitude-6.3 earthquake hits Afghanistan","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A magnitude-6.3 earthquake struck near Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan, on Monday, causing at least 20 deaths and over 530 injuries.

people on board, has said he feels like the \"luckiest man\" alive, but is also suffering physically and mentally.\n\nViswashkumar Ramesh walked away from the wreckage of the London-bound flight in Ahmedabad in extraordinary scenes that amazed the world.\n\nHe said it was a \"miracle\" he escaped but told how he has lost everything, as his younger brother Ajay was a few seats away on the flight and died in the crash in June.\n\nSince returning to his home in Leicester, Mr Ramesh has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), his advisers said, and has been unable to speak to his wife and four-year-old son.\n\nFlames engulfed the Boeing 787 flight when it went down shortly after take-off in western India.\n\nShocking video shared at the time showed Mr Ramesh walking away from the aftermath with seemingly superficial injuries, as smoke billowed in the background.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News, an emotional Mr Ramesh, whose first language is Gujarati, said: \"I'm only one survivor. Still, I'm not believing. It's a miracle.\n\n\"I lost my brother as well. My brother is my backbone. Last few years, he was always supporting me.\"\n\nHe described the devastating impact the ordeal has had on his family life.\n\n\"Now I'm alone. I just sit in my room alone, not talking with my wife, my son. I just like to be alone in my house,\" Mr Ramesh said.\n\nHe  spoke from his hospital bed in India  at the time, describing how he had managed to unbuckle himself and crawl out of the wreckage, and met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while receiving treatment for his injuries.\n\nOf the passengers and crew killed, 169 were Indian nationals and 52 were Britons, while 19 others were killed on the ground.\n\nA  preliminary report  into the crash, published by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in July, said fuel supply to the engines was cut off just seconds after take-off. Meanwhile, an investigation is ongoing and the airline said care for Mr Ramesh, and all families affected by the tragedy, \"remains our absolute priority\".\n\nThis is the first time the 39-year-old has spoken to the media since he has been back in the UK. Several news organisations were invited for an interview and a documentary crew was also filming in the room.\n\nThe BBC had detailed discussions with his advisers around his duty of care before the interview.\n\nWhen asked about his memories of the day of the crash, he said: \"I can't say anything about that now.\"\n\nFlanked by local community leader Sanjiv Patel and spokesman Radd Seiger, Mr Ramesh said it was too painful to recall the events of the disaster, and broke down during parts of an interview at the home of Mr Patel in Leicester.\n\nMr Ramesh described the anguish he and his family are now living through.\n\n\"For me, after this accident... very difficult.\n\n\"Physically, mentally, also my family as well, mentally... my mum last four months, she is sitting every day outside the door, not talking, nothing.\n\n\"I'm not talking to anyone else. I do not like to talk with anyone else.\n\n\"I can't talk about much. I'm thinking all night, I'm suffering mentally.\n\n\"Every day is painful for the whole family.\"\n\nMr Ramesh also spoke about the physical injuries he suffered in the crash, which saw him  escape his seat - 11A - through an opening in the fuselage .\n\nHe says he suffers pain in his leg, shoulder, knee and back, and has not been able to work or drive since the tragedy.\n\n\"When I walk, not walk properly, slowly, slowly, my wife help,\" he added.\n\nMr Ramesh was diagnosed with PTSD while he was being treated in hospital in India but has not received any medical treatment since being back home, his advisers said.\n\nThey described him as being lost and broken, with a long journey of recovery ahead, and are demanding a meeting with Air India's executives, claiming he has been treated poorly by the airline since the crash.\n\n\"They're in crisis, mentally, physically, financially,\" Mr Patel said.\n\n\"It's devastated his family.\n\n\"Whoever's responsible at the highest level should be on the ground meeting the victims of this tragic event, and understanding their needs and to be heard.\"\n\nAir India has offered an interim compensation payment to Mr Ramesh of £21,500, which has been accepted, but his advisers say this is not enough to meet his immediate needs.\n\nThe family fishing business in Diu in India, which Mr Ramesh ran with his brother before the crash, has since collasped, his advisers said.\n\nSpokesman for the family Mr Seiger said they had invited Air India for a meeting on three occasions, and all three were either \"ignored or turned down\".\n\nThe media interviews were the team's way of reissuing that appeal for the fourth time, he said.\n\nMr Seiger added: \"It's appalling that we are having to sit here today and putting him [Viswashkumar] through this.\n\n\"The people who should be sitting here today are the executives of Air India, the people responsible for trying to put things right.\n\n\"Please come and sit down with us so that we can work through this together to try and alleviate some of this suffering.\"\n\nIn a statement, the airline, which is owned by Tata Group, said senior leaders from the parent company continue to visit families to express their deepest condolences.\n\n\"An offer has been made to Mr Ramesh's representatives to arrange such a meeting, we will continue to reach out and we very much hope to receive a positive response,\" it said.\n\nThe airline told the BBC that this offer was made before the media interviews with Mr Ramesh."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c803gk1vpzko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"00:02:26.113+00:00","title":"Why brushing teeth twice a day is not always best and other myths busted","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article challenges common dental myths, such as brushing twice daily being essential, and emphasizes that proper technique and timing—especially avoiding brushing immediately after acidic foods—matter more than frequency.

a scrub morning and night, a rinse with water and maybe a minty mouthwash for good measure.\n\nBut according to dental experts, even the most diligent brushers might be making a few mistakes that could be undoing their good work.\n\nDr Praveen Sharma, from the school of dentistry at the University of Birmingham, says that half of adults in the UK will have gum disease at some point and an early sign is bleeding gums.\n\n\"If your gums are bleeding or swollen it's a sign you need to brush better,\" he says.\n\nAs well as regular dentist visits, here are four things he and BBC's What's Up Docs podcast hosts Dr Xand and Dr Chris van Tulleken, say many of us are currently getting wrong which if we change could improve the health of our teeth.\n\nIt's one of the great dental commandments - brushing twice a day - and that's what  the NHS recommends .\n\nBut Dr Sharma says the real key is quality, not quantity.\n\n\"If you can find time, then yes, brush properly twice a day,\" he says. \"But it's better to do it once a day well and once quickly for two minutes.\n\nIf you only have time to brush and floss properly once a day then he recommends it be in the evening.\n\nOf course, no one likes flossing, but Dr Sharma says using interdental brushes can make it easier and less painful.\n\nWhen it comes to the method, each tooth has an outer, biting and inner surface and all three need to be brushed.\n\nDr Sharma advises small circular motions over each surface without applying too much pressure. He also says to pay particular attention to the junction between the tooth and the gum as that's where gum disease can occur.\n\nDr Xand says it's important to \"focus on the sensation of the bristles\" and approach tooth brushing mindfully, not scrolling on your phone at the same time.\n\nMany people brush their teeth right after eating, but that might not be doing your enamel any favours.\n\n\"Ideally, brush before breakfast,\" Dr Sharma says. \"You don't want to do it after something acidic.\n\n\"If you do brush after, then you need to leave some space between eating and brushing.\"\n\nThat's because acids from foods and drinks, especially fruit juice or coffee, can soften tooth enamel and brushing too soon afterwards can wear it away.\n\nDr Chris suggests rinsing your mouth with water after eating to get rid of some acid and then waiting at least 30 minutes if you are brushing after breakfast.\n\nIf you've been spitting, rinsing and gargling after every brush, you might want to rethink that last step.\n\n\"You spit but don't rinse with water,\" Dr Sharma advises. Rinsing your mouth washes away the concentrated fluoride in the remaining toothpaste.\n\nThat means simply spitting out the excess toothpaste and leaving the thin layer of fluoride behind to continue protecting your teeth.\n\nIf you want to rinse your mouth after brushing, use a mouthwash.\n\nWith shelves full of whitening, charcoal, and enamel-boosting pastes, it's easy to assume the pricier options will give you a healthier smile.\n\nBut according to Dr Sharma, it doesn't really matter which brand you choose, as long as it contains one key ingredient.\n\n\"As long as your toothpaste has fluoride, it doesn't make much difference,\" he says, adding that he tends to buy whatever is cheaper or on offer.\n\nFluoride helps protect enamel and prevents decay, and that's what really counts.\n\nHowever, your dentist may recommend specific toothpastes to use if you suffer from issues such as sensitive gums."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20e8qzllewo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"13:41:37.053+00:00","title":"Drones spotted over Belgian military base for third night","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Drones have been spotted flying over multiple Belgian military bases, including Kleine-Brogel, Leopoldsburg, and Marche-en-Famenne, and near airports in Ostend and Antwerp, prompting a helicopter deployment and an investigation by Belgian Defence Minister Theo Francken.

Trump's planned tests are 'not nuclear explosions', US energy secretary says\n\nThe US is not planning to conduct nuclear explosions, Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said, calming global concerns after President Donald Trump called on the military to resume weapons testing.\n\n\"These are not nuclear explosions,\"  Wright told Fox News on Sunday. \"These are what we call non-critical explosions.\"\n\nThe comments come days after Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had directed defence officials to \"start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis\" with rival powers.\n\nBut Wright, whose agency oversees testing, said people living in the Nevada desert should have \"no worries\" about seeing a mushroom cloud.\n\n\"Americans near historic test sites such as the Nevada National Security Site have no cause for concern,\" Wright said. \"So you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry, and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"\n\nTrump's comments on Truth Social last week were interpreted by many as a sign the US was preparing to restart full-scale nuclear blasts for the first time since 1992.\n\nIn an interview with 60 Minutes on CBS, which was recorded on Friday and aired on Sunday, Trump reiterated his position.\n\n\"I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes,\" Trump said when asked by CBS's Norah O'Donnell if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years.\n\n\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" he added.\n\nRussia and China have not carried out such tests since 1990 and 1996 respectively.\n\nPressed further on the topic, Trump said: \"They don't go and tell you about it.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test,\" he said, adding North Korea and Pakistan to the list of nations allegedly testing their arsenals.\n\nOn Monday, China's foreign ministry denied conducting nuclear weapons tests.\n\nAs a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always... upheld a self-defence nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing\", spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference in Beijing.\n\nShe added that China hoped the US would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability\".\n\nOn Thursday, Russia too denied it had carried out nuclear tests.\n\n\"Regarding the tests of Poseidon and Burevestnik, we hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists, referencing the names of Russian weapons. \"This cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test.\"\n\nNorth Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear testing since the 1990s - and even Pyongyang announced a moratorium in 2018.\n\nThe exact number of nuclear warheads held by each country is kept secret in each case - but Russia is thought to have a total of about 5,459 warheads while the US has about 5,177, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).\n\nThe US-based ACA gives slightly higher estimates, saying America's nuclear stockpile sits at about 5,225 warheads, while Russia has approximately 5,580.\n\nChina is the world's third largest nuclear power with about 600 warheads, France has 290, the United Kingdom 225, India 180, Pakistan 170, Israel 90 and North Korea 50, the FAS says.\n\nAccording to US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China has roughly doubled its nuclear arsenal in the past five years and is expected to exceed 1,000 weapons by 2030."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43dp99k4vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"15:55:13.403+00:00","title":"Kimberly-Clark buys Tylenol-maker Kenvue in more

Supreme Court in case eagerly awaited around the world\n\nWhat may be the biggest battle yet in Donald Trump's trade war is about to begin.\n\nThe Trump administration heads to the US Supreme Court on Wednesday, facing off against small businesses and a group of states who contend most of the tariffs it has put in place are illegal and should be struck down.\n\nIf the court agrees with them, Trump's trade strategy would be upended, including the sweeping global tariffs he first announced in April. The government would also likely have to refund some of the billions of dollars it has collected through the tariffs, which are taxes on imports.\n\nThe final decision from the justices will come after what could be months of poring over the arguments and discussing the merits of the case. Eventually they will hold a vote.\n\nTrump has described the fight in epic terms, warning a loss would tie his hands in trade negotiations and imperil national security.\n\nOn Sunday, the president said he will not attend the hearing in person as he did not want to cause a distraction.\n\n\"I wanted to go so badly... I just don't want to do anything to deflect the importance of that decision,\" he said. \"It's not about me, it's about our country.\"\n\nTrump previously said that if he does not win the case the US will be \"weakened\" and in a \"financial mess\" for many years to come.\n\nThe stakes feel just as high for many businesses in the US and abroad, which have been paying the price while getting whipped about by fast-changing policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs will cost Learning Resources, a US seller of toys made mostly overseas and one of the businesses suing the government, $14m (£10.66m) this year. That is seven times what it spent on tariffs in 2024, according to CEO Rick Woldenberg.\n\n\"They've thrown our business into unbelievable disruption,\" he said, noting the company has had to shift the manufacturing of hundreds of items since January.\n\nFew businesses, though, are banking on a win at the court.\n\n\"We are hopeful that this is going to be ruled illegal but we're all also trying to prepare that it's setting in,\" said Bill Harris, co-founder of Georgia-based Cooperative Coffees.\n\nHis co-op, which imports coffee from more than a dozen countries, has already paid roughly $1.3m in tariffs since April.\n\nIn deciding this case, the Supreme Court will have to take on a broader question: How far does presidential power go?\n\nLegal analysts say it is hard to predict the justices' answer, but a ruling siding with Trump will give him and future White House occupants greater reach.\n\nSpecifically, the case concerns tariffs that the Trump administration imposed using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the White House has embraced for its speed and flexibility.   By declaring an emergency under the law, Trump can issue immediate orders and bypass longer, established processes.\n\nTrump first invoked the law in February to tax goods from China, Mexico and Canada, saying drug trafficking from those countries constituted an emergency.\n\nHe deployed it again in April, ordering levies ranging from 10% to 50% on goods from   almost every country in the world. This time, he said the US trade deficit - where the US imports more than it exports - posed an \"extraordinary and unusual threat\".\n\nThose tariffs took hold in fits and starts this summer while the US pushed countries to strike \"deals\".\n\nOpponents say the law authorises the president to regulate trade but never mentions the word \"tariffs\", and they contend that only Congress can establish taxes under the US Constitution.\n\nThey have also challenged whether the issues cited by the White House, especially the trade deficit, represent emergencies.\n\nMembers of Congress from both parties have asserted the Constitution gives them responsibility for creating tariffs, duties and taxes, as well.\n\nMore than 200 Democrats in both chambers and one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski, filed a brief to the Supreme Court, where they also argued the emergency law did not grant the president power to use tariffs as a tool for gaining leverage in trade talks.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Senate made a symbolic and bipartisan move to pass three resolutions rejecting Trump's tariffs, including one to end the national emergency he declared. They are not expected to be approved in the House.\n\nStill, business groups said they hoped the rebuke would send a message to the justices.\n\nThree lower courts have ruled against the administration. After the Supreme Court hears arguments on Wednesday it will have until June to issue its decision, although most expect a ruling to come by January.\n\nWhatever it decides has implications for an estimated $90bn worth of import taxes already paid - roughly half the tariff revenue the US collected this year through September, according to Wells Fargo analysts.\n\nTrump officials have warned that sum could swell to $1tn if the court takes until June.\n\nIf the government is forced to issue refunds, Cooperative Coffees will \"absolutely\" try to recoup its money, said Mr Harris, but that would not make up for all the disruption.\n\nHis business has had to take out an extra line of credit, raise prices and find ways to survive with lower profits.\n\n\"This is an energy drain like I've never seen,\" said Mr Harris, who is also chief financial officer of Cafe Campesino, one of the 23 roasteries that own Cooperative Coffees. \"It dominates all the conversations and it just kind of sucks the life out of you.\"\n\nThe White House says that if it loses, it will impose levies via other means, such as a law allowing the president to put tariffs of up to 15% in place for 150 days.\n\nEven then, businesses would have some relief, since those other means require steps like issuing formal notices, which take time and deliberation, said trade lawyer Ted Murphy of Sidley Austin.\n\n\"This is not just about the money,\" he said. \"The president has announced tariffs on Sunday that go into effect on Wednesday, without advance notice, without any real process.\"\n\n\"I think that's the bigger thing for this case for businesses - whether or not that is going to be in our future,\" he added.\n\nThere is no clear sign of how the court will rule.\n\nIn recent years it has struck down major policies, such as Biden-era student loan forgiveness, as White House overreach.\n\nBut the nine justices, six of whom were appointed by Republicans, including three by Trump,   have shown deference to this president in other recent disputes and historically have given leeway to the White House on questions of national security.\n\n\"I really do think arguments are available for the Supreme Court to go in all different directions,\" said Greta Peisch, partner at Wiley and former trade lawyer in the Biden administration.\n\nAdam White, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he expected the court to strike down the tariffs, but avoid questions like what constitutes a national emergency.\n\nThe case has already complicated the White House's trade deals, such as one struck in July with the European Union.\n\nThe European Parliament is currently considering ratifying the agreement, which sets US tariffs on European goods at 15% in exchange for promises including  allowing in more US agricultural products.\n\n\"They're not going to act on this until they see the outcome of the Supreme Court decision,\" said John Clarke, former director for international trade at the European Commission.\n\nIn Switzerland, which recently downgraded its outlook for economic growth citing America’s 39% tariff on its goods, chocolatier Daniel Bloch said he'd welcome a ruling against the Trump administration.\n\nHis business Chocolats Camille Bloch is absorbing about a third of the cost of new tariffs on kosher chocolate that his firm has exported to the US for decades, aiming to blunt price increases and maintain sales. That decision has wiped out profits for the unit and is not sustainable, he said.\n\nHe hopes Trump will reconsider his tariffs altogether, because \"that would be easiest\".\n\n\"If the court were to make the tariffs go away of course we would see that as a positive sign,\" he said. \"But we don't trust that that will bring the solution.\"\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

been arrested, as a political showdown deepens over the leaking of a video that allegedly shows severe abuse of a Palestinian detainee by Israeli soldiers.\n\nMaj Gen Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned as the Military Advocate General of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) last week, saying that she took full responsibility for the leak.\n\nOn Sunday, the story took a darker turn when she was reported as missing, with police mounting an hours-long search for her on a beach north of Tel Aviv.\n\nShe was subsequently found alive and well, police said, but was then taken into custody.\n\nThe fallout from the leaked video is intensifying by the day.\n\nBroadcast in August 2024 on an Israeli news channel, the footage shows reserve soldiers at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel taking aside a detainee, then surrounding him with riot shields to block visibility while he was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object.\n\nThe detainee was subsequently treated for severe injuries.\n\nFive reservists were subsequently charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm to the detainee. They have denied the charges and have not been named.\n\nOn Sunday, four of the reservists wore black balaclavas to hide their faces as they appeared at a news conference outside the Supreme Court in Jerusalem along with their lawyers, who demanded the dismissal of their trial.\n\nAdi Keidar, a lawyer from the right-wing legal aid organisation Honenu, claimed his clients were subject to \"to a faulty, biased and completely cooked-up legal process\".\n\nOn Monday, it emerged the detainee at the centre of the case was released to Gaza in October as part of an exchange with Hamas of convicted prisoners and detainees held without charge by Israel for hostages held by Hamas since 7 October 2023.\n\nLast week, a criminal investigation was launched into the leaking of the video.\n\nGen Tomer-Yerushalmi was put on leave while the inquiry took place.\n\nOn Friday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said she would not be allowed to return to her post.\n\nShortly after that, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned.\n\nIn her resignation letter, she said she took full responsibility for any material that was released to the media from the unit.\n\n\"I approved the release of material to the media in an attempt to counter false propaganda against the army's law enforcement authorities,\" she said.\n\nThat is a reference to efforts by some right-wing political figures in Israel to claim that the allegations of severe abuse of the Palestinian detainee had been fabricated.\n\nShe added: \"It is our duty to investigate whenever there is reasonable suspicion of acts of violence against a detainee.\"\n\nAfter her resignation, Katz issued a fierce condemnation of her conduct.\n\n\"Anyone who spreads blood libels against IDF troops is unfit to wear the army's uniform,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed his defence minister's words on Sunday, saying that the incident at Sde Teiman was \"perhaps the most severe public relations attack that the State of Israel has experienced since its establishment\".\n\nHours later, the first reports began appearing in the Israeli media that Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was missing, sparking fears that a political scandal had taken a turn towards tragedy.\n\nA massive search effort was launched. Several hours later, she was found \"safe and in good health\" in the coastal area of Herzliya, Israeli police said.\n\nOvernight, a police spokesperson announced that two people had been arrested on suspicion of \"leaking and other serious criminal offences\" as part of an investigation.\n\nIsraeli media reported that the pair were Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi and the former chief military prosecutor, Col Matan Solomosh.\n\nThe Sde Teiman incident has been a lightning rod for the division between the left and right in Israel.\n\nOn the right, the leaking of the video is denounced as a defamation of the Israeli military, all but amounting to an act of treason.\n\nAfter Israeli military police went to Sde Teiman to question 11 reservists over the incident in July 2024, far-right protesters - including at least three lawmakers from Netanyahu's governing coalition - broke into the facility to show their support.\n\nOn the left, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi's decision to enable the footage to be released is seen as the one time she lived up to the responsibilities of her post.\n\nThe video is regarded by the left as concrete evidence backing up multiple reports of abuse of Palestinian detainees since the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.\n\nLast October, a report by a UN commission of inquiry alleged that thousands of child and adult detainees from Gaza had been \"subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence\".\n\nIsrael's government said it rejected the accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees, and insisted that it was \"fully committed to international legal standards\". It also said it had carried out thorough investigations into every complaint."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz913ylq3k3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"23:20:59.737+00:00","title":"Will AI mean the end of call centres?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores whether artificial intelligence will replace human call centres in customer service, with mixed predictions and real-world examples.

ChatGPT whether AI will replace humans in the customer service industry, and it will offer a diplomatic answer, the summary of which is \"they will work side by side\".\n\nHumans though, are not so optimistic.\n\nLast year, the chief executive of Indian technology firm Tata Consultancy Services, K Krithivasan, told the Financial Times that AI may soon mean that there is  \"minimal need\" for call centres in Asia.\n\nMeanwhile, AI will autonomously resolve  80% of common customer service issues  by 2029, predicts business and technology research firm Gartner.\n\nThere is currently a lot of hype around \"AI agents\". That is the term given to AI systems that can operate more autonomously and make decisions.\n\nThey could turbo-charge current non-AI chatbots, known as \"rule-based chatbots\", which can only answer a set list of questions.\n\nMy own recent experience with parcel delivery firm Evri's chatbot illustrates the existing, non-AI state of play.\n\nMy parcel had not arrived, and Ezra (the name of the chatbot), offered to \"get this resolved straight away\".\n\nIt asked for a tracking reference, and after I had typed that in, it told me that my parcel had been delivered.\n\nI could request proof of delivery, and when I did so it showed me a photo of the package… at the wrong front door. And there was no option to advance the conversation after this \"evidence\" was shown.\n\nIn response, Evri tells the BBC it is investing £57m to further improve the service.\n\n\"Our intelligent chat facility uses tracking data to suggest the most helpful responses and ensure the customer's parcel is delivered as soon as possible, if this has not happened as scheduled,\" it says.\n\n\"Our data confirms the vast majority of people get the answers they need from our chat facility, first time, within seconds.  We're always reviewing feedback to ensure our services are as helpful as possible, and we continue to make enhancements on a rolling basis.\"\n\nOn the flipside, rival parcel delivery firm DPD had to disable its less rule-bound AI chatbot after it criticised the company and swore at users.\n\nGetting the balance right between being on brand and genuinely helping customers is a tricky one for businesses to grapple with as they migrate to AI.\n\nSome  85% of customer service leaders  are exploring, piloting or deploying AI chatbots, according to Gartner. But it also found that only 20% of such projects are fully meeting expectations.\n\n\"You can have a much more natural conversation with AI,\" says Gartner analyst Emily Potosky.\n\n\"But the downside is the chatbot could hallucinate, it could give you out-of-date information, or tell you completely the wrong thing. For parcel delivery I would say rules-based agents are great because there are only so many permutations of questions about someone's package.\"\n\nResources and money are among the key reasons businesses may be considering the move from human to AI customer service. But Ms Potosky points out that it isn't a given that AI will be cheaper than human agents.\n\n\"This is a very expensive technology,\" she says.\n\nThe first thing that any business wanting to replace humans with AI will have to do is ensure that they have extensive training data.\n\n\"There's this idea that knowledge management becomes less important because generative AI can solve the fact that their knowledge is not particularly well organised, but actually the opposite is the case,\" adds Ms Potosky.\n\n\"Knowledge management is more important when deploying generative AI.\"\n\nJoe Inzerillo, chief digital officer at software giant Salesforce, tells the BBC that call centres provide fertile training grounds for AIs, particularly ones that have been moved to low-cost areas such as the Philippines and India.\n\nThis is because a lot of staff training will have been done, which the AI can also learn from.\n\n\"You have a huge amount of documentation, and that's all really great stuff for the AI to have when it is going to take over that first line of defence,\" he says.\n\nSalesforce's AI-powered customer service platform, AgentForce, is currently being used by a range of customers from Formula 1, to insurance firm Prudential, restaurant-booking website Open Table, and social media site Reddit.\n\nMr Inzerillo says that when Salesforce first put the platform through its paces it learned some valuable lessons about how to make the AI seem more human-like.\n\n\"While a human might say 'sorry to hear that', the agent just opened a ticket,\" says Mr Inzerillo.\n\nSo the AI was trained to show more sympathy, especially when a customer has a problem.\n\nSalesforce also found that not allowing the agent to talk about competitors proved problematic.\n\n\"This backfired when customers asked legitimate questions about integrating Microsoft Teams with Salesforce,\" says Mr Inzerillo. \"The agent refused to help because Microsoft appeared on our competitor list.\"\n\nThe firm subsequently replaced that rigid rule.\n\nSalesforce has ambitious plans for the continuing rollout of its AI agents, and so far it claims that they are a hit with its customers. It also says that the vast majority of customers, 94%, are choosing to interact with AI agents when given the option.\n\n\"We've seen customer satisfaction rates that are in excess of what people get with humans – then AI can unlock the next level of customer service,\" says Mr Inzerillo.\n\nIt has also meant that the firm has cut customer service costs by $100m, but he was keen to play down recent headlines that suggest this has led to 4,000 jobs being slashed.\n\n\"A very large percentage of those people got redeployed in other areas around customer service.\"\n\nFiona Coleman runs QStory, a firm which is using AI to offer human call centre workers more flexibility in their shift patterns. Its customers include eBay and NatWest.\n\nWhile she sees the value in AI improving working conditions, she is not sure the technology can ever replace humans entirely.\n\n\"There are times where I don't want to have a digital engagement, and I want to speak to a human,\" she says.\n\n\"Let's see what it looks like in five years' time - whether an AI can do a mortgage application, or talk about a debt problem. Let's see whether the AI has got empathetic enough.\"\n\nThe use of AI in customer service could, in fact, already be facing a backlash.\n\nLegislation currently proposed in the US to move off-shore call centres back to America also requires businesses to disclose the use of AI, and transfer a caller to a human if asked to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, Gartner predicted that by 2028 the EU  may mandate  what is called 'the right to talk to a human\" as part of its consumer protection rules."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl294dpxxko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:16:58.825+00:00","title":"Erin Patterson: Australian mushroom murderer appeals against convictions","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Erin Patterson, a 51-year-old woman from Victoria, has formally appealed her life sentence for murdering three relatives — her father-in-law Don Patterson, mother-in-law Gail Patterson, and sister-in-law Heather Wilkinson — through a toxic mushroom meal served in 2023.

mushroom murderer appeals against convictions\n\nErin Patterson, the Australian serving life for the mushroom murders,  has officially lodged an appeal against her convictions.\n\nThe 51-year-old was found guilty of murdering three relatives and trying to kill another with a toxic mushroom meal at her home in the state of Victoria in 2023.\n\nUnder Australian law, appeals are not an automatic right, and Patterson's legal team had to convince the Court of Appeal that there might have been legal errors in her trial.\n\nPatterson's appeal was officially lodged on Monday, after the court gave her lawyers the green light to challenge the convictions. The grounds of the appeal have not yet been disclosed.\n\nThroughout the 11-week trial, Patterson maintained her innocence, arguing that it had all been a terrible accident, and she had not intentionally included toxic mushrooms in the beef Wellington meal she cooked and served for lunch.\n\nHer in-laws Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, died after eating the meal. Heather's husband Ian Wilkinson, a local pastor, survived after recovering from a coma, and still has ongoing health issues related to the poisoning.\n\nAfter seven days of deliberations, the panel of 12 jurors delivered their unanimous decision - guilty on all charges.\n\nShe was handed one of the longest ever jail terms given to a female offender in Australia - life in prison, with no chance of release for at least 33 years. That means Patterson will be in her 80s before she can apply for parole.\n\nNow she will have the chance to challenge the jury's conviction.\n\nThe 28-day window to lodge an appeal expired on 6 October, however a new procedural rule, giving legal teams an extension without needing to explain why, gave her lawyers more time to lodge the paperwork.\n\nLast month,  prosecutors filed their own appeal  against the sentencing, saying it was \"manifestly inadequate\".\n\nThere was intense public interest in the toxic mushroom case, and a media frenzy swirled around the small courtroom in the country town of Morwell during the trial.\n\nOver nine weeks of testimony, the jury heard evidence suggesting Patterson had foraged death cap mushrooms in nearby towns and lured her victims to the fatal meal under the false pretence that she had cancer - before trying to conceal her crimes by lying to police and disposing of evidence.\n\nHer estranged husband, Simon Patterson, had also been invited to the lunch but cancelled at the last minute, in part due to his belief that his wife had been  trying to poison him for years .\n\nFollowing the trial, it was revealed that he had become so violently ill after eating several of her meals in the past that he had been in a coma, a large part of his bowel had been surgically removed, and his family had been told to say goodbye to him twice as he was not expected to survive.\n\nPatterson is currently in a female maximum security prison - the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre in Melbourne. During her sentencing, Justice Christopher Beale told the court she spent 22 hours a day in her cell, with no contact with other inmates due to her \"major offender status\".\n\nThe judge noted that Patterson's reputation and the huge media and public interest in the case meant she would likely \"remain a notorious prisoner for many years to come, and, as such, remain at significant risk from other prisoners\"."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/business/kimberly-clark-kenvue.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"08:09:55-05:00","title":"Kimberly-Clark Agrees to Buy Kenvue, Maker of Tylenol, for $40 Billion","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kimberly-Clark has agreed to acquire Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, in a $40 billion deal, driven by Kenvue's declining stock due to unproven claims linking acetaminophen to autism, particularly amplified by political statements from President Trump.

In September, President Trump said that pregnant women should “fight like hell not to take it.”\n\nShares of Kenvue rebounded strongly on the deal announcement, rising 20 percent in premarket trading. Kimberly-Clark’s stock fell about 15 percent, which if sustained would drag the company’s value down to a multiyear low.\n\nKenvue was spun off by Johnson & Johnson in 2023 to run the group’s consumer products division. Johnson & Johnson kept the more profitable, faster-growing businesses in pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Kenvue has struggled to find its footing as a stand-alone company, and the activist investment firm Starboard bought a stake in the company and pushed for change. In March, the chief executive of Starboard, Jeffrey Smith, took a seat on Kenvue’s board of directors.\n\nIn July, Kenvue announced the departure of its chief executive alongside a review of the company’s strategy.\n\nUnder the terms of the cash-and-stock deal with Kenvue, Kimberly-Clark shareholders would own roughly 54 percent of the new company. The combined group would generate about $32 billion in annual revenue and $7 billion in operating profit, the companies said. There are nearly $2 billion in “synergies” that could be achieved by cutting costs, which often means layoffs, in the three years after the companies combine, they added.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to approvals from shareholders and regulators. The companies said in a release announcing the deal that Kimberly-Clark had “carefully considered all risks and opportunities, working with some of the world’s foremost scientific, regulatory, legal and other experts.”\n\nMike Hsu, Kimberly-Clark’s chief executive, would become chairman and chief executive of the new company. The combined group would be based in Kimberly-Clark’s headquarters in Irving, Texas, and “continue to have a significant presence in Kenvue’s locations.” Kenvue moved to a new headquarters campus in Summit, N.J., earlier this year.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/ford-foundation-heather-gerken-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:00:07-05:00","title":"Ford Foundation’s New Leader Vows to Protect Elections and the Rule of Law","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Ford Foundation, one of the largest and most influential philanthropies in the U.S., is facing escalating political scrutiny from the Trump administration, particularly under the leadership of Vice President JD Vance, who has called for the revocation of its tax-exempt status and accused it of supporting liberal agendas.

Gerken, said Friday that the foundation, which has a long history of supporting social justice and civil rights initiatives, was undeterred.\n\nHer central priority, she said, was “defending the rule of law and protecting our election system.”\n\nThough she would not formally start until the next day, her spacious office, high above the soaring atrium garden in the foundation’s headquarters near the United Nations, was filled with markers of her priorities and mementos of her past.\n\nOn one wall was a series of black-and-white photographs documenting the civil rights and suffragist movements. Another wall featured an unlikely image of Justice David H. Souter atop a human pyramid of his law clerks, including a young Ms. Gerken. Nearby, there was a photo of Ms. Gerken, who was until recently dean of Yale Law School, flanked by two of its more prominent graduates, Hillary Clinton and Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nBefore her eight years as dean, Ms. Gerken specialized in election law, both as a litigator and a scholar. She is the author of an influential 2009 book, “The Democracy Index.”\n\nVice President JD Vance, himself a Yale Law alumnus, has long been a harsh critic of philanthropies that he said support liberal causes, and of the Ford Foundation in particular.\n\n“Why don’t we seize the assets of the Ford Foundation, tax their assets and give it to the people who’ve had their lives destroyed by their radical open-borders agenda?” he mused in 2021 as a Senate candidate.\n\nHe has not let up. In September, Mr. Vance denounced the foundation by name in the aftermath of the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk, suggesting the administration could go after its nonprofit tax status.\n\nAsked about Mr. Vance’s comments, Ms. Gerken responded with a history lesson.\n\n“When the Ford Foundation funded the civil rights movement, it was a source of controversy,” she said. “It was incredibly important that we were protected in doing that work. When the Ford Foundation stood up to protect free speech and dissent during the McCarthy era, it was incredibly important that we had the right to do that.”\n\nThe targets of the administration’s attacks on its perceived enemies have included universities, law firms and the news media. Officials have indicated that they now plan to go after the tax-exempt status of liberal philanthropies. The Ford Foundation, with its $16 billion endowment, is expected to be a prime target.\n\nJohn Palfrey, the president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, said Ms. Gerken was “an astonishingly good fit” at a fraught moment. “The challenges that face philanthropy and the rule of law that are unprecedented,” he said.\n\nMs. Gerken, for her part, insisted that protecting democracy is a nonpartisan goal.\n\n“No one believes that an election system should not be free and fair,” she said. “No one believes that people should not have the right to speak. These are the bedrock commitments of any democracy, and it’s really important to hold fast to them.”\n\nAsked for practical examples of what the foundation’s emphasis on protecting democracy would entail, Ms. Gerken pointed to securing the infrastructure of elections.\n\n“We’re going to do everything we can,” she said, “to protect the ability of election administrators to carry out a free and fair elections, to make sure that every citizen has an opportunity to vote without fear or intimidation and that those votes are properly counted.”\n\nPast financial support for election administration from donors has drawn criticism from conservatives. After Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, and his wife, Priscilla Chan, donated more than $400 million for such efforts in 2020, they were accused by Mr. Vance and others of scheming to elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. as president.\n\nIn 2022, a spokesman for the couple said their efforts had been “a one-time donation.”\n\nNathaniel Persily, a law professor at Stanford, said Ms. Gerken was the ideal choice for the job. But he was less sanguine about how her efforts would be received by a divided nation.\n\n“Defining a public interest seems almost impossible in these polarized times,” he said. “This is all the more true for a foundation committed to supporting democracy and the rule of law — two values that now seem to mean very different things depending on the side of the political aisle in which one is sitting.”\n\nMs. Gerken’s admirers praised her fair-mindedness, resolve and talent for reaching across the aisle.\n\n“I don’t really discuss partisan politics these days, but my guess is we have pretty different orientations,” Thomas B. Griffith, a retired federal appeals court judge appointed by President George W. Bush. But he added that he was “a huge fan” of hers for increasing intellectual diversity at Yale Law School.\n\n“I found Heather to be very supportive of the Federalist Society,” Judge Griffith said, referring to the conservative legal group.\n\n“Whether she succeeded in making conservatives feel comfortable at Yale, I don’t know,” he added. “But she certainly made an effort to do so.”\n\nMs. Gerken’s fellow election-law specialists said she faces a daunting task.\n\n“The institutions of American democracy are being torched right now,” Professor Persily said. “The question for all of us working in the democracy space is to consider new institutions that might be built from the ashes.”\n\nPamela Karlan, another voting rights specialist at Stanford, said Ms. Gerken might set an example.\n\n“The Ford Foundation could be a real leader in getting other parts of civil society to start speaking up and pushing back,” she said. “That’s already starting, but there isn’t a clear focal point and she might provide that.”\n\nMs. Gerken said she also took a long view.\n\n“There isn’t just the work of now, of this moment, which is incredibly important,” she said. “We are also going to need to dream a new democracy into existence.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq050z917lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"06:07:45.254+00:00","title":"Legacy created for Italian couple who died in Grenfell Tower fire","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article recounts the tragic deaths of Italian architects Marco Gottardi and Gloria Trevisan in the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in London, and focuses on their families' ongoing efforts to ensure the tragedy is not forgotten.

Italian couple in love who were following their dreams in London.\n\nThey lived on the top floor of Grenfell Tower in west London and had been in England for just a few months when they were both killed in the fire on 14 June 2017.\n\nThey were found in each other's arms, having died from smoke inhalation.\n\nLike so many who suffered loss at Grenfell, Marco and Gloria's loved ones are frustrated about the ongoing \"lack of accountability\" over the fire and the long \"wait for justice\".\n\nWhile  work continues to take down the tower , their families have set up a foundation in Italy for young people with the same dreams as Marco and Gloria, who were both architects, to ensure Grenfell is not forgotten.\n\nMarco Gottardi, 27, and Gloria Trevisan, 26, both grew up in northern Italy.\n\nMarco lived with his parents in San Stino Di Livenza. A quiet town close to Venice, surrounded by vineyards and waterways.\n\nAt their home, Marco's mother Daniela Burigotto says he was \"very kind, calm and affectionate\", an only child but \"always surrounded by many friends\".\n\nFrancesca Tolardo, Marco's childhood friend, describes him as \"straight talking and always there when you needed him\".\n\nHe was a much valued player at his local football club San Stino Di Livenza FC, according to coach Franco Formentin, who says Marco was \"respectful and kind\", before adding that they now run an annual tournament in his honour.\n\nAt the Scarpa–Mattei High School hangs a plaque dedicated to Marco, Gloria and the other Grenfell Tower victims in the main assembly hall.\n\nValeri Valeria, Marco's former teacher, says he was \"a bright boy who  smiled with his eyes\".\n\nGloria Trevisan grew up in the town of Camposampiero near Padua.\n\n\"Marco and Gloria's funerals were within days of each other,\" says Gloria's mother Emaneula Disaro. \"It was a double suffering.\"\n\nHer father Loris Trevisan says she was also a \"determined\" and \"focused\" young woman, who was \"very close to her family - her brother Julio and to us\".\n\nGloria's family say she also had a real \"gift\" for art and design.\n\nAt the Modigliani technical college in Padua, a lecture hall is now dedicated to her  and Marco.\n\n\"Gloria was meticulous,\" recalls retired lecturer Ruggero Guariento, \"more like a professional than a student\".\n\nAfter college, Marco and Gloria met while studying at the prestigious International University of Architecture in Venice, where they both achieved top grades in their bachelors and masters architecture degrees.\n\nProf Sara Di Resta taught the pair and says they were \"two brilliant students with great technical knowledge\".\n\nThe couple wanted to start their careers in London and moved into flat 202 on the 23rd floor of Grenfell Tower.\n\n\"The tower looked beautiful - on the outside and inside,\" says Marco's dad, who visited the couple. \"And it was in a great neighbourhood.\"\n\nMarco's mum Daniela remembers the flat's \"marvellous\" views.\n\n\"I told Gloria you don't have to go out, you have the whole world all around you.\"\n\nOn the night of the fire the top floors of Grenfell Tower were the deadliest.\n\nThe fire started just before 01:00 BST in a flat on the fourth floor  and spread up the exterior cladding to the roof in just half an hour.\n\nResidents who rang 999 were told by the London Fire Brigade to remain in their flats.\n\nFor two hours Marco and Gloria spoke several times to their parents in agonising phone calls until they couldn't get through anymore.\n\nThe \"stay put\" advice was not officially revoked until 02:47. However, by that time the corridors were filled with thick black smoke.\n\n\"They repeatedly asked the firefighters to be able to go down,\" recalls Marco's mum Daniela. \"When they gave the OK there was no longer any possibility of being able to do it.\"\n\nGloria's mother adds: \"I have so much anger if I think about that night. I hope that things have changed and when there's a fire they absolutely have to evacuate. They cannot wait.\"\n\nHer father Loris says: \"Every day I have her in my head and in my heart. She is my first thought in the morning and last thought at night.\"\n\nMarco Gottardi and Gloria Trevisan were each buried in their home towns. On Marco's grave stone are written the words 'Insieme Per Sempre' – Together Forever.\n\n\"They were two good people who believed in London,\" says Marco's father Giannino Gottardi, \"with clear ideas about how to make their dreams come true\".\n\nWith the blessing and support of Gloria's family, Marco's parents created a charitable foundation called Grenfell Love to help aspiring architects through scholarships and bursaries.\n\nThe families also attend conferences for architects, engineers and builders to raise awareness around building safety in Italy.\n\nGrenfell Love has helped many different local schools across the Veneto region, including some which Marco and Gloria went to.\n\nAt Marco's former secondary school in San Stino Di Livenza is a new computer classroom.\n\nIn Gloria's old primary school, the foundation funded a sensory room which supports children with special needs.\n\nArchitecture students in Venice also received bursaries to research their final thesis.\n\n\"It's important not just to recall the tragedy but to recall the dream,\" says Prof Sara Di Resta.\n\nWhile the families' work in Italy has created hope out of Grenfell, they're less hopeful of finding justice in the UK.\n\n\"There are so many different people involved,\" says Gloria's dad. \"Public bodies, big companies, multinational corporations. I'm not sure anyone will be punished.\"\n\nGloria's mum adds: \"I have this feeling they are trying to prolong it all as much as possible precisely to avoid prosecuting these people in some way.\"\n\nMarco's mum Daniela finds it frustrating that many of the people and companies involved are still \"operating as normal\".\n\n\"It is difficult for a mother who has lost the most precious thing in the world to know that no-one is still paying after eight years.\"\n\nMarco's dad says he is trying to remain positive: \"We want to trust the English justice system.\n\n\"We accept it maybe be a long process, but hope it's a thorough process and the guilty are identified and punished.\"\n\nGrenfell Tower will be taken down over the next two years.\n\nDuring that time, the Metropolitan Police is completing its investigation.\n\nIn theory when the tower is no longer standing, criminal trials over the fire could begin.\n\nFor some the sight of the building has been perpetual trigger for their trauma.\n\nFor others it should have been allowed to remain intact as long as possible until justice for the victims was achieved.\n\nGloria's parents have visited the Grenfell Tower site and understand why some  believe \"demolishing the tower is sacrilege\".\n\nEmanuela says she found it difficult to look at.\n\nWith the tower coming down, she adds: \"We just want to make sure Gloria and Marco along with the other 70 victims are remembered.\"\n\nOngoing work is taking place to commission and create a memorial on the site of the tower.\n\nFrancesca says she and Marco's family hope its architecture and design will be \"fitting\" to what happened and the loss of so many people.\n\n\"As the Grenfell Love foundation we've always understood the tower had to come down. We want to see maybe 72 trees or 72 columns,\" she says. \"Some water such as a fountain – a symbol against the fire.\"\n\nGrenfell Tower is slowly disappearing from the London skyline, but the demands for justice and a fitting legacy and memorial remain.\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on  Sounds  and follow BBC London on  Facebook ,  X  and  Instagram .

Hopkins reflects on the dangers of hatred and political extremism, warning that polarization is a form of fascism.

on\n\nNot many people can say they've been given a private piano recital by Sir Anthony Hopkins.\n\nBut that's exactly what happened when our four-strong BBC team went to interview the double Oscar-winning actor in Los Angeles.\n\nWe were in the same room as the man who terrified as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, shattered as a butler in The Remains of The Day and devastated as a dad with dementia in The Father.\n\nAn actor who was cast by Oliver Stone as President Nixon because - according to Sir Anthony - the director said \"you're nuts like Nixon\".\n\nAt a grand piano in a hotel in Beverly Hills, as he plays us a piece he calls Goodbye, it's clear an artistic soul exudes from his every pore. Haunting notes of music, lines of poetry and Shakespearean verses cascade out of him.\n\nWe were meeting because Sir Anthony's publishing his autobiography, We Did OK, Kid, an honest and at times upsetting account of a loner who was bullied and written off as a child in Wales and became one of Britain's finest acting exports.\n\nHe puts his success down to sheer luck, telling me: \"I couldn't take credit for any of it, I couldn't have planned any of this - and now at 87, about to turn 88, I get up in the morning and I think, 'Hello, I'm still here,' and I still don't get it.\"\n\nFrom the outside, it looks less about luck and more about his deep understanding of human emotion, as his performances testify. I ask what makes him such an instinctive actor.\n\n\"It's such a miracle being alive,\" he says.\n\nHe finds the complexity of human beings \"fascinating... I mean, how can you produce Beethoven, Bach and then Treblinka and Auschwitz?\"\n\nSir Anthony has always understood the duality of being human, and it explains his acting range.\n\nHe got his first break on film when the actor Peter O'Toole suggested he audition for the 1968 movie The Lion in Winter, in which O'Toole was playing Henry II.\n\nAt that point, Sir Anthony had been a member of Sir Laurence Olivier's National Theatre company for several years. But, he recalls: \"I couldn't fit into the British theatre style, I just felt out of it.\"\n\nHe also \"didn't want to be standing on stage holding a spear for the rest of my life, in wrinkled tights, I just wanted to have a bit of a life\".\n\nHe was cast as Richard the Lionheart and couldn't believe that a baker's son from Port Talbot was working with Katharine Hepburn.\n\nThe actress, playing his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, gave him \"the best advice I've had\" as they rehearsed their first scene together. She told him to \"just speak the lines... Don't act, just do it\". She also said he was \"real good\".\n\nHepburn was right, of course. Some classically trained theatre actors, particularly back then, didn't appreciate how much they needed to adjust their performance for the intimacy of a camera. He did.\n\nHe doesn't much care for talking about the craft of acting, or certainly the reverence there can be around it, but he shares his method with me: \"Be still. Be economic. Don't act or twitch around, you know, 'showing off' acting... simplify, simplify, simplify'.\"\n\nHis performances stand out because he's an actor of huge emotional depth and psychological insight. Think of him as Dr Treves, the friend and protector of John Hurt's Elephant Man.\n\nOr as Lecter, still for me the most terrifying of characters more than 30 years on. The serial killer is a monster but Sir Anthony understood that less is more, on screen.\n\nInstead of playing Lecter as obviously monstrous, \"you go the opposite way, you draw back\", he explains. He realised as soon as he had read a few pages of the script that the role was \"a life-changer\".\n\nHe writes in his memoir that he \"instinctively sensed how to play Hannibal. I have the devil in me. We all have the devil in us, I know what scares people\".\n\nHe tells me he played Lecter still - and deadly. So when he was in character opposite other actors, he decided, \"Don't take your eyes off the person. That's terrifying.\"\n\nHe puts on Lecter's metallic rasp for me and appears to enjoy repeating his character's words to Jodie Foster's Clarice. \"You're not real FBI,\" he almost hisses.\n\n\"That's scary,\" he says. He's not wrong. Even in an upmarket LA hotel on a warm autumn afternoon, I'm feeling chilled.\n\nAnd what about the famous line - \"I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\", which he follows with that vampire-like hiss?\n\nHe explains as a child he'd seen the Hungarian-American actor Bela Lugosi do the same when playing Count Dracula in the 1931 movie. Sir Anthony decided in the moment of filming to copy it and The Silence of the Lambs director, Jonathan Demme, kept it in.\n\nWhat is startling about the memoir is the disconnect between how the world viewed the young actor and how much it was clearly missing about him. He was bullied at school for what other kids saw as his large \"elephant\" head.\n\nHe was slapped around by teachers who deemed him a complete dunce. Even his parents pretty much wrote him off.\n\nHe believes it was the making of him. It \"gave me a core of anger, resentment and revenge\", he says.\n\nBut why hadn't they all noticed his talents? This was a child who was given the 10 volume Children's Encyclopaedia when he was six (\"I was so captivated, I read every one of them\") and became fascinated by astronomy.\n\nA boy who played the piano, made art and loved Dickens and Shakespeare, quoting from them extensively.\n\nA school report in 1955 when he was 17 marked \"the turning point\" in his life. It was terrible, as usual. \"What's going to happen to you?\" Sir Anthony recalls his father lamenting. \"I said: 'One day, I'll show you, both of you'.\"\n\nHe's pleased his parents lived long enough to see him succeed. When he won his first best actor Oscar, for The Silence of the Lambs in 1992, 11 years to the day after his father died, he rang his mother in Wales and said: \"I guess I did OK.\"\n\nBut it was a rough ride in the early days. He was an alcoholic who picked fights with directors and others. He wasn't always a good husband to his first two wives. Booze turned him nasty.\n\n\"That's the ugly side of alcoholism,\" he writes. \"It brought out a brutal side of me. I'm not proud of it at all.\"\n\nThe anger, he believes, came \"from inside, my own insecurities, being bullied at school and all the rest of it. I didn't like authority\".\n\nThen one night in LA in December 1975, almost 50 years ago, he drove his car while in \"a complete alcoholic blackout\". When he came to, he realised that he was \"out of control\" and could have killed someone. He made a phone call to ask for help.\n\n\"Suddenly, something said 'it's all over, now you can start living'... the craving left and it's never come back.\"\n\nAt his first meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, he had a realisation about everyone else in the room.\n\n\"They're all misfits like me. Like all of us. We feel we never belong. We feel self-hatred. All of us are the same. I'm not alone.\"\n\nIt's that feeling of disconnection that shines out of the book.\n\nHe writes that his wife Stella believes he is on the autism spectrum which is \"likely right, given my proclivity for memorisation and repetition... and my lack of emotionality\" but he says he prefers the term \"cold fish\". I want to know why.\n\nIt seems to have begun as a reaction to the bullying and screaming at him through school and National Service.\n\n\"I'd just stare them out, and that drove them mad,\" he recalls. \"You withdraw into yourself and think, 'OK you can't hurt me, can you?\" It was, he says, his \"only defence... and that's a power, you see: I don't care.\"\n\nOf course, Sir Anthony does care and we talk a little about the state of the world. It's at this point in our interview that he becomes his most passionate. He grew up in Port Talbot surrounded by people who had been impacted, even brutalised, by war.\n\nHe played Sir Nicholas Winton, the man who saved hundreds of mainly Jewish children from the Nazis, in the film One Life.\n\nWhen I ask him about whether he worries about increasing polarisation now, he becomes very animated and intense.\n\n\"The world has always been a place of utter turmoil. But I think if we go on in this way of hatred... we are dead.\n\n\"Nobody's allowed to have an opinion. Nobody can have a different view. That's fascism. And it's insanity.\"\n\nIf he has any advice about it all, it's to say \"'Come on, stop this rubbish, beating each other up over ideas. They're only ideas and we're only going to be dead one day'.\"\n\nI ask him, as he looks back at his long life, what his biggest regrets are and he's quick to answer. \"People I've hurt over the years, the stupid things I did.\"\n\nHe's estranged from his only child, his daughter Abigail, who he walked out on when she was just one and he was in the depths of alcoholism.\n\nHe writes that \"after realising I was unfit as a father for Abigail, I vowed not to have any more children... I couldn't do to another child what I'd done to her\".\n\nHe has tried to repair their relationship over the years.\n\nWhen he took on the role of King Lear in his 80s, in Sir Richard Eyre's 2018 film, Lear's words to his daughter Cordelia struck a painful chord.\n\nHe writes in his new book: \"The line that hit me harder than perhaps any other I've ever spoken was 'I did her wrong'. Saying those words, I felt deeply, perhaps for the first time in my life, how I had hurt my own daughter.\n\n\"I remembered how as a baby she'd lit up when I walked into the room. I remembered how I said goodbye to her the night I walked out. I remembered how I had tried and failed to win her back later. I remembered how I had given up. And as Lear, but also as myself, I began to cry.\"\n\nHe didn't want to talk about it in our interview. Poignantly, in this section of the book, he writes: \"I hope my daughter knows that my door is always open to her.\"\n\nI couldn't help feeling moved reading this. It's as if he is trying to send a message to her, hoping against hope that there might be a reconciliation before it is too late.\n\nAt 87, he is looking back, aware he has lived many years longer than he has left to live. \"Most of my friends have died, they're gone, God bless them,\" he says. \"I hope to be around a little longer. But even that, I'm thinking, 'oh well, I had a good time'.\"\n\nHe certainly still appears to be having fun. After some early reserve when we first met, he quickly relaxed. When he played the piano, he shared how he had lost two much-loved pianos when his house burnt down in the LA fires earlier this year. \"They were all under the rubble\".\n\nAs we walked through the hotel lobby together, he was spotted by guests and waved happily to them. \"I like to say hi because people think actors are special. We're not at all,\" he smiles.\n\nWhatever he says, it was special to spend a few hours in his presence. He's an acting legend who's given us six decades of memorable performances.

‘Political Score’ You Might Not Even Know You Have\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T09:16:55-05:00\n\nFriends ping Mark Grebner about their love interests. Politicians rely on him to help target voters. Reporters ask whether the suspect in a mass shooting is Democrat or Republican.\n\nIn us-and-them America, where many people are eager to render flash judgments on the basis of a person’s political choices, Mr. Grebner tells them the score — literally.\n\nFor two decades, Mr. Grebner, 72, has been a pioneer in assembling vast databases that can generate a single number to predict which party a voter is most likely to support.\n\nAs campaigning for Tuesday’s election entered the final stretch, dozens of candidates for mayor and city councils across Michigan were using Mr. Grebner’s political scoring to target persuadable voters by knocking on their doors and bombarding them with mailings.\n\nWith a few keystrokes, Mr. Grebner can call up the score of just about any adult in Michigan. The rapper Marshall Bruce Mathers III, better known as Eminem, scores as 58 percent likely to vote Democratic. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer comes up as 99 percent Democratic. William Clay Ford Jr., the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, scores 86 percent Republican.\n\n“If you give me a name of someone you know in Michigan, I could appall you by how much information I have about them,” he said one afternoon, as he pecked away at his keyboard in his ground-floor apartment in East Lansing. Scout, his deaf, 17-year-old Australian cattle dog, meandered nearby.\n\nAmericans have never been so thoroughly dissected and judged by data. Credit scores are key to determining whether someone gets a loan and at what interest rate. Students have SAT scores. Adults have cholesterol scores. Everyone has a Social Security number.\n\nPolitical scores, assembled from a variety of voting and personal data, are the rating that many Americans don’t even know they have.\n\nYet lists of voters with reams of data attached to their names are relentlessly bought and sold in the world of politics, a niche of the mammoth market of Americans’ personal data.\n\nIn their drive to divine how people might vote, analysts seek out correlations across broad fields of data, said Paul Westcott, the executive vice president of L2, one of the country’s leading vendors of voter lists. Boat owners, for example, tend to be more conservative, while wine drinkers trend progressive, Mr. Westcott said.\n\nL2’s political partisanship database has 850 fields for each voter, a vast trove of information on everything from ethnicity, education and income to gun ownership, donations and more obscure categories like “interest in woodworking” and ownership of cats, dogs or horses.\n\nAll of these markers of identity help decipher who we are. But in recent decades, party affiliation has reached tribal status. For some people, knowing whether a friend, colleague or potential lover votes red or blue is a make-or-break piece of information.Americans also increasingly want to understand the political affiliations of suspects after acts of political violence like the murder of Charlie Kirk in September or the attempted assassinations of Donald Trump last year.\n\n“Everyone is grasping for a reason and trying to say, Oh, it’s left wing, or Oh, it’s right wing,” Mr. Westcott said. His company’s data includes what it calls a partisanship score for 217 million American voters. The score is a number from 0 to 100 that tries to predict which party a voter will choose in the next election.\n\nL2 said it sells its lists to political campaigns, advocacy groups, and researchers, but it has a blanket ban on selling data for commercial purposes. (The New York Times newsroom uses data from L2 to form a list of voters to call for its polling and to report on voter trends.)\n\nMr. Westcott also said that he receives queries about individuals, which he does not answer.\n\nIn addition to L2, which is nonpartisan, a handful of other companies compile national lists of voters, including i360, which specializes in conservative clients, and Catalist, which has largely Democratic clients.\n\nHow long political scores will remain concealed from the public is an open question.\n\n“I suppose it would be naïve to think that this kind of information will remain inaccessible forever,” said Costas Panagopoulos, a professor of political science and expert in voting behavior at Northeastern University.\n\nThe Trump administration is already trying to link the data about individual Americans that is held in various government databases. It has also demanded sensitive personal data from states to help it build a national voter list.\n\nArtificial intelligence is likely to offer even greater detail and precision to data about voter preferences, Mr. Panagopoulos said. By vacuuming up social media posts, an algorithm could take into account whether someone attended a protest, or whether they were photographed with Make America Great Again gear. Candidates for office might be able to use an A.I. model to decide which issues would resonate with a voter and the best time of day to reach them.\n\nFor the friends and acquaintances of Mr. Grebner, the data is just a phone call away.\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon in late September, a reporter from a local Michigan news service called him to ask about the political leanings of the suspected gunman in an attack on a Mormon church that had killed four people that morning.Social media was filled with conjecture on the motive for the attack in Grand Blanc Township, a suburb of Flint, Mich., as people sought to understand the violence.\n\nMr. Grebner told the reporter the gunman’s score: 81 percent likely to vote Republican.\n\nFurther reporting by journalists in the days after the attack revealed that the suspect, a former Marine named Thomas Jacob Sanford, did not appear to have been motivated by politics, but by a deep hatred for Mormons.\n\nBut the rush to view the shooting through the prism of politics highlights how these databases reduce voters to a number — and the risks of oversimplifying complex views.\n\nStill, the demand for the information remains.\n\nCalculating political scores for voters, which began around two decades ago, is both art and science. Algorithms take into account the obvious, like party registration or whether a voter requested a ballot for a Republican or Democratic primary.\n\nBut in some 20 states, including Michigan, voters do not list their party preference, increasing the importance of other data to divine a voter’s inclinations.\n\nMr. Grebner’s database looks for patterns among voters in the same household — they often vote alike. And he obtains copies of petitions that circulate in the state and sends the thousands of pages to Bangladesh, where data entry specialists record each signer.\n\nMr. Grebner revels in his own eccentricity. A staunch Democrat, he has a collection of Make America Great Again hats that he wears among family and friends when he knows it will rile them. He said he does not spend time thinking about the pros and cons of gathering and selling data on his fellow Michiganders.\n\n“I want better ways to understand people,” he said.\n\nAsked whether it is potentially harmful for every American to be assigned a political score, he sounded flustered.\n\n“Is it a good thing or a bad thing? Well, it just is,” he said. “Is it good to refine arsenic? I don’t know. But if I were to refine arsenic, I would want it to be really pure.”\n\nMr. Grebner, the son of a school superintendent who traveled from job to job across the Midwest, has a made a career of using data to tweak the establishment.\n\nAs a student at Michigan State University in the 1970s, he riled the administration and faculty by creating a booklet that ranked professors based on surveys of students, a pre-internet version of websites that rate professors.\n\nIn addition to running his company, Practical Political Data, he is a longstanding member of the Ingham County Board of Commissioners, and his election slogans over the years prove that politics and humor can successfully mix.\n\n“No worse than the rest,” says one of his bumper stickers.\n\n“We can’t get rid of him,” reads a yard sign.\n\nHe began ranking and categorizing the partisanship of voters in the 1990s, and his scoring system came in the early 2000s. His methods were widely admired among politicians and those who worked in the field.\n\n“I would describe him as an irreverent genius, very idiosyncratic and interested in upending conventional wisdom at every opportunity,” said Donald P. Green, a professor at Columbia University who has worked with Mr. Grebner on research projects.\n\nWhile most of Mr. Grebner’s clients are political candidates, he is happy to help out a friend in need. Four years ago, a fellow graduate of Michigan State, Lawrence Kestenbaum, sent him a query: “What do you have for Andrea Curtis Rothney?”\n\nMr. Kestenbaum, a committed Democrat who is the Washtenaw County clerk, had spotted Ms. Rothney on Tinder and was cautiously courting her.\n\nMr. Grebner reported back that Ms. Rothney was not only a Democrat, but a dedicated one, “serious about voting and signing petitions.” His model scored her as 93 percent Democratic.\n\n“I was pleased and maybe a little relieved,” Mr. Kestenbaum said.\n\nThree years later, the couple were married.\n\nMs. Rothney, who only learned about the political due diligence her husband had conducted when a New York Times reporter reached out to her about it, says she thinks it was a “good idea.”\n\nA match made in Democratic heaven?\n\n“Hmmm,” Ms. Rothney pondered the question. “Well, purgatory, anyway,” she said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/podcasts/the-headlines/election-day-zohran-mamdani-new-york-new-jersey-virginia-redistricting.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"06:00:06-05:00","title":"The Big Elections to Watch This Week, and a Louvre Heist Update","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This week’s news highlights include a major U.S. court ruling requiring the Trump administration to continue paying SNAP benefits during a government shutdown, signaling the importance of social safety nets during fiscal crises.

The Supreme Court later blocked Judge Ali’s order, citing the president’s constitutional authority over foreign policy. While the legal dispute remains unresolved, the case reflects a broader pattern: the executive branch has repeatedly circumvented legislative oversight and judicial checks through executive orders and budgetary maneuvers, even when courts initially intervene.

It has been reviewed by 21 judges, spawned thousands of pages of filings and lumbered forward even after the administration dissolved the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government office responsible for disbursing much of the contested funding.\n\nWith Congress offering little resistance to Mr. Trump’s expansion of executive power — even at lawmakers’ own expense — the courts have become a final obstacle to some of his most aggressive moves.\n\nThe long, twisted journey of one of the dozens of lawsuits that have been filed against pieces of the Trump agenda offers insights into the ways the judicial system, clogged by the flood of suits and deliberative by design, has been unable to keep up with the president’s moves. And while Mr. Trump has racked up plenty of courtroom losses, he ultimately has not been seriously restrained.\n\nMr. Trump took office in January pledging to drastically downsize foreign aid spending. But the money at issue had been appropriated by Congress and set aside for specific projects. The Global Health Council and the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, along with similarly situated groups, sued in February, soon after the president declared he would re-evaluate every award, keeping those dollars from beneficiaries abroad.\n\nDespite a series of interim rulings, the courts have not yet settled the core legal issues at stake. Yet even so, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to choke off $4 billion in foreign aid appropriations that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had signed into law last year.\n\nThe administration has maintained in court that all foreign aid is an expression of the country’s foreign policy, which is ultimately up to the president to set. In public, Mr. Trump has referred to foreign aid as a wasteful “left-wing scam,” contended that the United States gives billions to “countries that hate us” and stated in the executive order that he was targeting foreign aid that was “in many cases antithetical to American values.”\n\nAfter the justices’ most recent order in September, the case has returned to courts in Washington, where litigation is moving ahead slowly, stymied in part by the government shutdown. But advocates say that at this point even if Mr. Trump loses in court, much of the damage is done.\n\nLauren Bateman, a lawyer from the advocacy organization Public Citizen who represented some of the nonprofits, said that each visit to the Supreme Court was “representative of the length to which the administration is going to withhold lifesaving foreign assistance.”\n\n“And unfortunately,” she added, “both because of orders issued by the Supreme Court in this case and in other cases, the avenue for relief has been getting narrower and narrower.”\n\nJust 24 days after Mr. Trump took office, a federal judge in Washington dealt him what initially appeared to be a major blow.\n\nJudge Amir H. Ali found that his “blanket suspension” of foreign aid grants was most likely unlawful, and that the ensuing chaos had a “catastrophic effect on the humanitarian missions” of many groups involved. The judge ordered the government to reverse the freeze and begin paying out some $2 billion for work the groups had completed before the court stepped in.\n\nOne of Mr. Biden’s final nominees, Judge Ali started work three weeks before the start of Mr. Trump’s second term. As the president spent much of January signing stacks of executive orders, the judge and his colleagues fielded dozens of lawsuits challenging them.\n\nJudge Ali’s order stirred hope among public interest groups that the courts might provide a firewall against some of the president’s most aggressive moves. Believing the same, Mr. Trump’s allies mounted a campaign to discredit Judge Ali, blasting him for exceeding his authority and circulating threats to have him impeached.\n\nAs a practical matter, the initial ruling dealt with the narrow, most immediate issue: the spending freeze that Mr. Trump and his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had put in place to keep funds locked away while they orchestrated a downsizing.\n\nThe spending freeze alone appeared intended to cause chaos. The accounts of aid organizations ran dry with workers stranded overseas. Amid the freeze, associates of Elon Musk were simultaneously scrambling payment systems and sidelining or firing U.S.A.I.D. and State Department workers. Many of the civil servants who once processed payments were unreachable.\n\n“Basically all of their supply chains were shut off overnight, all the money stopped flowing, everything was halted,” said Stephen K. Wirth, a lawyer representing the aid organizations. “There was food rotting in ships, on docks. There was medicine expiring. It was unbelievably disruptive.”\n\nThe Trump administration appealed and quickly reached the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court’s three liberal justices, sided with Judge Ali and rejected the funding freeze.\n\nThe ruling was interim, governing the state of play while Judge Ali further considered the legal issues at play. But it hinted that Mr. Trump might not get a blank check, even from the conservative court.\n\nThe Trump administration began gradually abiding by Judge Ali’s order and paying out contracts, eventually surpassing $1 billion in back payments, according to court filings.\n\nSoon after, on March 10, the judge went further, addressing not only back payments but ruling that all of Mr. Trump’s efforts to cut foreign aid most likely violated the Constitution and federal law. He ordered the government to spend all the funds that Congress had set aside for foreign aid.\n\nThat same day, Mr. Rubio announced that more than 80 percent of U.S.A.I.D.’s programs would be cut, terminating thousands of contracts and effectively shuttering the agency. Even programs with longstanding bipartisan support, such as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, were in jeopardy. The groups complained in court, but Judge Ali remained narrowly focused on the funding as the government sped ahead of the litigation.\n\nIt was becoming clear how much room the Trump administration still had to maneuver.\n\nU.S.A.I.D. and its staff, which once oversaw a vast apparatus of grants and contracting, was decimated. And as litigation dragged on, the 2024 appropriations law that had created the foreign aid funding was inching toward expiration at the end of September.\n\nLawyers for the Justice Department once again appealed, arguing that it was in Mr. Trump’s constitutional authority to hold back money Congress had appropriated, a process known as impoundment.\n\nA three-judge panel, including two Republican appointees, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed. In August, the court ruled that only the comptroller general, not a constellation of outside groups, could sue to recover the money on Congress’s behalf.\n\nThe brief legal momentum the aid organizations had built stalled, an experience repeated across the system as appeals courts have repeatedly undone rulings by lower court judges blocking the Trump agenda.\n\nIn a major twist, on Aug. 29, the appeals court revisited and clarified its ruling. It allowed the groups to try again in the lower court with an argument that did not involve constitutional claims.\n\nOnce again, the Trump administration tried to sidestep the legal challenge by racing ahead before it could be fully resolved.\n\nIn a letter to Congress that night, the administration announced it would bypass lawmakers entirely, employing a legally dubious budgetary maneuver known as a pocket rescission. Daring Republicans in Congress to intervene, the administration indicated that anything short of a formal objection to cutting the spending by the end of the fiscal year would be taken as tacit approval.\n\nThe lawsuit was hardly over. But while some congressional Republicans complained about the move, none appeared willing to defy the president or fight to keep the funds.\n\nOn Sept. 3, Judge Ali stepped back in, writing that the move appeared to be only the latest way to circumvent Congress. He ordered the government to dole out more than $10 billion in expiring funds across the dozens of categories in which the aid groups operate.\n\nThe Trump administration appealed but gave some ground. It agreed to spend about $6.5 billion by the deadline but dug in its heels on the rest, much of which was set aside for development assistance, democracy promotion and peacekeeping.\n\nThe administration raced back to the Supreme Court for a third time, asking for a quick emergency order in its favor.\n\nOn Sept. 26, the justices granted one, blocking Judge Ali’s order and allowing the Sept. 30 deadline to pass with the funds still frozen.\n\nIn dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the case had wandered into “uncharted territory.” Such a consequential decision, which could bankrupt aid providers and unleash starvation and disease abroad, should not have been made without full consideration before the court, she said.\n\nIndeed, in just two paragraphs, the majority stated that harm to the president’s ability to conduct foreign policy from siding with Judge Ali would “outweigh the potential harm” to the groups being denied funding. But it stressed that the order was preliminary and should “not be read as a final determination on the merits.”\n\nNothing was settled. The legal dispute would go on.\n\nFor the communities abroad that depended on U.S. foreign aid for things like polio vaccines, pediatric care, mosquito netting and vitamin supplements, the legal caveat was little solace.\n\nThe Republican-led Congress has not thrown up any road blocks, and the administration keeps cutting.\n\n“It’s never been just about changing the foreign policy of the United States,” said Mr. Wirth, the lawyer for the aid organizations. “It’s also about showing that they can defy Congress and get away without it.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/world/02themorning-meet-sam-sifton.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"06:59:25-05:00","title":"Meet Your News Friend, the New Host of The Morning","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sam Sifton, a longtime journalist and food critic at The New York Times, has been named the new host of The Morning, the paper’s flagship daily newsletter read by over five million people.

He’ll guide us through what’s happening in the world. He’ll be a companion through troubling stories, piercing criticism, poignant profiles, great listens and every other bit of wonder this news organization produces.\n\nI’ve discovered, working with Sam this fall, that he’s a delightfully idiosyncratic dude. You should know about him! Since he came to The Times in 2002, he’s had seven extremely varied jobs. Among them:\n\nHe was the restaurant critic, from 2009-2011. (Ask him about his workout regimen to keep fit between all those meals.)\n\nHe was National editor, overseeing one of our largest news desks, through the Boston Marathon bombing and other big stories.\n\nHe basically invented NYT Cooking, a site so many of us have come to rely on. It’s the first place I turn when I panic: What do I do with these parsnips I found at the market? (Answer: Sam’s riff on seafood chowder.)\n\nFor the last five years, he has overseen all our culture and lifestyle coverage. So you’ll want to pay special attention to his recommendations in that department.\n\nI sat him down for this inquisition on Friday.\n\nAdam: OK, you’re hosting a morning newsletter. Are you a morning person?\n\nSam: I am. The hours between 5 and 9 pulse with creativity. And I love to greet a dawn. But I also know there are going to be some late nights on this show. Late nights, early mornings. I quit coffee during the pandemic. Let’s see if that holds!\n\nI’m caffeine-free as well. What’s the go-to breakfast?\n\nBreakfasts are routines. You perform yours until you start performing another one for reasons of whim or happenstance: granola and yogurt; French toast; a single fried egg with toast and marmalade; cut fruit. The past couple of days, I’ve been big into a toasted bagel with a lot of butter and a single slice each of deli ham and Swiss cheese.\n\nLast year, the Berkeley Divinity School at Yale gave you an honorary doctorate and described your last newsletter, What to Cook, as a “secular sermon.” What were you trying to do there and how does it apply to your new role with The Morning?\n\nI just wanted to let readers know: Everything’s going to be all right. Even if it’s awful right now, even if you’ve never made mayonnaise, even if you’re scared. We’ll figure it out. We’ll get to the truth. We’ll make something sustaining no matter what’s happening in the world. Most of all, I think I wanted to leave people with this thought: You’re not alone. And that’s my goal with The Morning, too.\n\nA leitmotif in the cooking newsletter was your life on the water. Tell us about it.\n\nI’ve been messing around in boats since I was a kid at my grandparents’ home in Maine. I’ve worked on schooners and cruise boats in New York Harbor, run light-tackle fishing boats here in the city and on Long Island, sailed up and down the East Coast. There’s something fantastic about being out on the water, especially when the cell service drops away. It’s a kind of freedom. And you can put some amazing stuff in your eyeballs experiencing it.\n\nAnother leitmotif was the casual way you throw together meals. Your cookbook is called “No-Recipe Recipes.” What are your tips for people who want to graduate from paint-by-numbers chefs to improvisational chefs? For me, it was all about reps.\n\nSometimes I love following a recipe — it’s like learning a new piece of music. Other times I just want to jam. But you’re right that getting your reps in makes jamming a great deal easier. It brings you confidence: in your skills, in your taste. Make any recipe three or four times and it’s no longer the author’s. It’s yours.\n\nHow’d you get into journalism?\n\nI wrote for my high school newspaper and something clicked. You can ask questions and write down the answers and deliver them to people and they’re happy to know — or really mad because they didn’t want anyone to know. I thought, If I can do that right, I’ll never have to get a real job.\n\nYou’re avuncular, even jolly. Are you one of these eternal optimists?\n\nI don’t know that my family would agree with that description. So I’ll paraphrase Machiavelli. There is nothing more important than appearing to be an optimist.\n\nYou’re a student of New York Times history. Give us a fun story about the old days.\n\nOne of my first jobs at The Times was editing the travel and food writing of a political reporter named R.W. Apple Jr., whom everyone called Johnny. Johnny was larger than life in his interests and in his appetites. One of the great rumors was that his expenses were so extravagant that they had their own cost center, separate from any department in the newsroom. I certainly never saw them.\n\nCellphones weren’t prevalent then, and Johnny was always on the road, chasing politics, eating immoderate meals. I found myself on deadline with a story of his about a trip to Vancouver (“Conspire to arrive by ship,” he wrote). I needed to get 10 lines out of the piece so it would fit on the page, but he demanded to be consulted about cuts. And he was nowhere to be found. What to do?\n\nI found a politics editor who said Johnny was in Ohio, talking to voters. That wasn’t much to go on. I thought for a minute, then went to a travel guide and made a list of all the four-star hotels in the state.\n\nI found Johnny on the second call. He laughed and laughed. We were only five minutes late.\n\nYour house is a bit of an animal sanctuary.\n\nTwo large dogs. One small cat, who is the bossiest. It can feel like a farm.\n\nOK, lightning round. Favorite book about boats.\n\n“Spartina,” by John Casey, from 1989. What a beautifully written novel. If I could spend a season working for Dick Pierce, the swamp Yankee protagonist of that excellent accounting of a complicated life in South County, Rhode Island, I’d do it. He’d no doubt make me as miserable on the water as on the shore, but I’m so fascinated by his world it’d be worth the pain. Plus, those sentences!\n\nFavorite song about food.\n\nNas, “Fried Chicken”? Kacey Musgraves, “Biscuits”? UB40, “Red Red Wine”? Too many choices!\n\nFavorite movie about New York.\n\nSpike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing.” (Hat tip to “Metropolitan” and the original “The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.”)\n\nFavorite neighborhood you’ve lived in.\n\nRed Hook, Brooklyn. I’ve been there close to 20 years.\n\nFavorite dish in Brooklyn.\n\nThere are far too many great dishes here to choose just one. Sometimes I want a banh mi from Ba Xuyen in Sunset Park, or a calzone at Lucali in Carroll Gardens. Other times, dry pot chicken from Authentic Szechuan in Park Slope. Doubles at A&A in Bed-Stuy? She-crab soup at Gage & Tollner in Downtown Brooklyn? I’m into all of it.\n\nFavorite thing to find at the farmers’ market.\n\nPea shoots, in a close tie with fairy-tale eggplants.\n\nFavorite thing to cook.\n\nCurrently? Clay pot rice, in the rice cooker. That’s a fine dinner.\n\nWhat scares you about this new role?\n\nYou mean writing a letter about news to millions and millions of people? Hoping that it’ll be the first thing they read in the morning while lying in bed? Hoping it’ll inform them, delight them, help them understand the world? What would scare me about that? See you in The Morning!\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/business/china-five-year-plan.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:21:06-05:00","title":"China Started Separating Its Economy From the West Years Ago","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"For over two decades, China has pursued a systematic strategy of economic self-reliance, replacing imported goods with domestic production through state-led policies such as 'Made in China 2025' and the Indigenous Innovation campaign.

on Chinese exports and prevent China’s factory overcapacity from swamping the United States economy. But his effort has hit an obstacle: Beijing was already well on its way to weaning its economy from the United States.\n\nFor two decades, China has systematically pursued economic self-reliance. China has been able to establish choke points to pressure the U.S. economy, while making it harder for Washington to block China.\n\nSelf-reliance has been a cornerstone of Chinese policymaking not just under Xi Jinping, the country’s top leader since 2012, but also under his predecessor, Hu Jintao.\n\nTheir program of replacing imported manufactured goods with domestic production has been costly and often inefficient. But it has left the West with dwindling leverage it can deploy during disputes.\n\nChina’s leaders have become increasingly public about emphasizing the self-reliance drive. It took a prominent place at an annual gathering of the Communist Party’s Central Committee last month, when the country’s top officials laid out a sketch of China’s next five-year plan.\n\n“We must first and foremost intensify efforts toward achieving greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology,” Mr. Xi said in a speech.\n\nThis year, China has wielded one of its most powerful choke points — its almost complete control over the world’s supply of rare earth metals and rare earth magnets.\n\nFaced with restrictions on China’s supply of rare earths, Mr. Trump last week accepted a compromise with Mr. Xi.\n\nTheir agreement left this year’s new U.S. tariffs for China similar to those for countries in Southeast Asia and lower than the tariffs for countries like India and Brazil, with which the United States has traditionally maintained closer relations.\n\nChina’s threat to put extremely tight controls on its rare earth exports also helped persuade the Trump administration to suspend a policy it adopted in September to expand the number of military-related Chinese companies that Americans are not allowed to do business with.\n\nChina has gained other choke points through its policies of manufacturing self-reliance. It is the world’s dominant producer of the ingredients needed to make antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals. It is also the main producer of a lot of electrical equipment, low-end computer chips and much more.\n\nThe United States has been left with fewer options when it needs to fight back. When Washington wanted to pressure Beijing to back down on rare earth export controls, the Trump administration threatened to restrict some of the last categories of crucial American exports that China still needs, like aircraft parts.\n\nChinese officials are now calling for their country to become even more self-reliant.\n\n“A comprehensive industrial system benefits the enhanced resilience of supply chains,” Tian Peiyan, one of Xi Jinping’s senior policy advisers, wrote in a journal over the weekend. He added that a very broad industrial base could create “a bulwark of economic security.”\n\nWhen China joined the World Trade Organization at the end of 2001, it depended on imports for a wide range of goods. The cars, telecommunications gear, power generation equipment and other manufactured goods that China made then were inferior to imports, prompting many Chinese companies and consumers to prefer imports.\n\nSince then, China has made enormous strides in the quality and quantity of these and many other goods.\n\n“Among 500 major industrial products, my country ranks first globally in the production of over 220,” Jin Zhuanglong, a prominent Chinese engineer, said last year when was minister of industry and information technology.\n\nLast month’s Central Committee gathering, or plenum, ordered that China would, starting next year, double down on its emphasis on advanced manufacturing. The plenum document ordered government and business to “work faster to boost China’s strength in manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, and cyberspace.”\n\nBeijing has combined the vast scale of its manufacturing operations with considerable state direction. Only a handful of business sectors are left in which American and European industries still lead the world, notably commercial aircraft and a few of the most advanced semiconductors.\n\n“President Xi has been quite good at finding ways to engineer American imports out of China’s supply chains over time, apart from the most advanced semiconductors designed but not made by U.S. firms,” said Brad Setser, a China specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nDespite more than a decade of heavy public investment, China lags in making the fastest semiconductors, needed for artificial intelligence and the latest military technologies. But Chinese companies have proved adept at buying and smuggling Nvidia microchips.\n\nChina’s policies to replace imports with domestic products have included the Indigenous Innovation campaign adopted soon after China joined the W.T.O., Made in China 2025 starting in 2015, and the effort called “high quality productive forces” in the past two years.\n\nThe state-controlled banking system has lent heavily at low interest rates to manufacturers of electric cars and solar panels, and China has become the largest exporter of these goods.\n\nFor some products, China has achieved self-reliance with protectionist trade policies. Since 2008, China has used tariffs and fees that more than double the sticker prices of imported cars and sport utility vehicles with large gasoline engines.\n\nThat has not only discouraged imports but has meant that Chinese consumers never became accustomed to powerful and bulky vehicles. This is one reason they have been quick to switch over to electric cars and hybrid gasoline-electric cars, which together now comprise more than half the Chinese market.\n\nSince early in Mr. Trump’s first term, American officials tended to dismiss concerns that China might use the choke points it was developing. To do so would damage China’s credibility as a destination for foreign investment, they argued, and would prompt multinationals to shift their purchases elsewhere.\n\nThat could yet happen. But China’s leaders, as shown last month, seemed determined to pursue even greater self-reliance.\n\nThe plenum’s closing statement said, “We must consolidate and expand our advantages, break through bottlenecks and constraints, and strengthen our shortcomings and weaknesses.”\n\nChris Buckley contributed reporting and Li You contributed research.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/world/europe/louvre-museum-robbery-suspects-investigation.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:38:58-05:00","title":"What to Know About the Louvre Heist Investigation","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A high-profile heist at the Louvre museum in Paris occurred on October 19, 2025, when two thieves broke into the Apollo Gallery through a window on the second floor and stole an estimated $100 million worth of iconic jewelry.

Here’s How Weird Things Could Look.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-01T05:02:09-04:00\n\nYou’ve probably seen gerrymandered congressional maps with snaking, winding, twisting districts drawn to give one party an advantage.\n\nIn the not too distant future, it might be possible to imagine even crazier maps.\n\nFor decades, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which has been interpreted to require the creation of majority-minority districts, has effectively put a ceiling on partisan gerrymandering, especially in the big diverse states. It hasn’t merely been a limit on gerrymandering; it’s the only meaningful federal limitation on partisan gerrymandering.\n\nSo if the Supreme Court strikes down Section 2, as it is considering, any equally populated House district is fair game, at least as far as federal law is concerned. There would be no federal law that might deter a 38-0 Texas congressional map that unanimously elected Republicans, or a 52-0 map in California with nothing but Democrats.\n\nTo be clear, such extreme gerrymanders are unlikely for a host of reasons. But the point isn’t that these two extreme maps are likely; it’s that they might soon be legal. And while states may not go this far, they may nonetheless be tempted to push toward more extreme maps than ever before.\n\nAs long as Section 2 remains, a maximal partisan gerrymander isn’t likely to pass legal muster in any of the largest states in the country. Most obviously, Section 2 prevents Republicans from breaking up every Democratic district in red states with a large enough nonwhite population. In Missouri and Tennessee, for instance, Republicans broke up the districts representing majority white but Democratic-leaning cities like Kansas City and Nashville, but had to preserve the Democratic districts in St. Louis and Memphis with large Black populations.\n\nWithout Section 2, Republicans could legally break up any majority-minority district in a red state. Take Houston, which currently has both majority Black and Hispanic congressional districts. Without the law, these areas could be sliced up and divided among multiple pinwheel-like districts that stretch far into the countryside.\n\nLess obviously, Section 2 prevents Democrats from diluting overwhelmingly Democratic majority-minority districts, whose voters might otherwise be spread out to flip red districts. In California, for instance, a maximal partisan gerrymander might split Democratic-leaning Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Los Angeles among dozens of districts that stretch to the more conservative parts of the state.\n\nAgain, these exact maps are unlikely; they are best seen as illustrations of how urban districts can be — and often are — diluted for partisan purposes. Many congressional incumbents would balk at maximum gerrymanders. They don’t want to represent incoherent, pinwheel-like districts. Even if they were fine with such districts in theory, the new lines would probably deprive them of their traditional bases of support. Swing state legislators might not support such extreme maps, either. Even under the current rules, ongoing efforts to redraw maps in states like Kansas, Indiana and Illinois have sometimes struggled to find the requisite votes.\n\nBut while such extreme gerrymanders might still be unlikely, they’re no longer implausible to contemplate. And there is a lot that states could do just short of creating unanimous districts, especially as President Trump’s push for mid-cycle redistricting has sparked an escalating redistricting war.\n\nMath won’t get in the way, either. As a rule of thumb, a state’s congressional map can be drawn such that each district roughly reflects the overall vote statewide. In a state like Texas, it ought to be possible to draw 38 approximately Trump +14 districts. In California, 52 districts that would have voted Harris +20 ought to be possible as well. In the two demonstration maps, all 38 districts in Texas voted for Mr. Trump in both 2020 and 2024, including by at least 10 points in 2024. Ms. Harris won by at least 15 points in every California district.\n\nAnd if Texas Republicans think Trump +14 is a hair too vulnerable — they probably would, as most Republican districts today are even safer — they could draw a 35-3 map with the red districts at approximately Trump +19. Either way, it would represent an enormous shift from 2024, when Democrats won 13 seats in Texas and Republicans won nine in California.\n\nIn the short term, Republicans would be better positioned than Democrats in an all-out redistricting war. There are simply more Democratic-held seats in states where Republicans exercise full control over the redistricting process than the other way around. More blue states have constitutional limitations on gerrymandering, like nonpartisan commissions. And blue state courts have tended to enforce constitutional provisions against gerrymandering more vigorously than red state courts.\n\nOver the longer term, however, Democrats could level the playing field by amending blue state constitutions to allow partisan gerrymandering, whether in response to mid-cycle redistricting or lastingly. Constitutional amendments are not easy to enact, but Democrats seem likely to pull this off in California, and they are attempting to do so in Virginia as well. In the years ahead, New York or Colorado could follow a similar path. If blue states manage to do so, Democrats could potentially eliminate as many seats as Republicans, even if the Supreme Court strikes down Section 2.\n\nEither way, the House of Representatives would become significantly less representative, whether in terms of the diversity of the seats or its responsiveness to public opinion overall. The number of swing districts could plunge. And the congressional map might look stranger than ever before.\n\nCalifornia 2024 presidential election results by congressional district are from The Downballot. Extreme redistricting scenario congressional district results are from Dave’s Redistricting. Current California districts reflect boundaries as of Oct. 31. Current Texas districts reflect boundaries enacted in August as part of mid-cycle redistricting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/technology/openai-amazon-cloud-computing.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:25:51-05:00","title":"OpenAI Signs $38 Billion Cloud Computing Deal With Amazon","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"OpenAI has announced a $38 billion agreement with Amazon to purchase cloud computing services over seven years, marking a pivotal step in its expansion of AI infrastructure.

hundreds of billions of dollars in computing power from the chipmakers Nvidia and AMD and the cloud computing company Oracle, OpenAI has reached a multibillion-dollar agreement with Amazon.\n\nOpenAI said on Monday that it had agreed to purchase $38 billion in cloud computing services from Amazon over the next seven years. The additional computing power will help OpenAI build and deploy its artificial intelligence technologies, including the ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2023, OpenAI bought all of its computing power from Microsoft as part of a complex partnership. Their contract stipulated that OpenAI must buy solely from Microsoft, its primary investor, unless Microsoft gave approval for computing deals with other companies.\n\nOver the past 18 months, as OpenAI complained that it was not able to get all the computing power it needed from Microsoft, the tech giant allowed the start-up to sign separate deals with two other cloud companies.\n\nThen, last week, Microsoft and OpenAI renegotiated their contract so that OpenAI was free to purchase services from any cloud computing company without Microsoft’s approval.\n\nComing just days later, OpenAI’s $38 billion agreement with Amazon is part of the A.I. company’s fast-speed effort to expand the already enormous pool of computing power that fuels its ambitions. OpenAI is also working to build new computer data centers with Oracle, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, the United Arab Emirates and others.\n\nTo help fund the construction of the data centers, the company has also inked a complex set of deals with the chipmakers Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom.\n\nAs OpenAI secures hundreds of billions of dollars in additional computing power, it is racing to keep pace with many of the tech industry’s largest companies. Over the last year, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft committed a total of than $360 billion in capital expenditures.\n\nAs both OpenAI and these tech giants increase their spending, some financial analysts and tech historians are concerned that the tech industry is heading toward a dangerous bubble. Artificial intelligence remains an unproven and expensive technology that could take years to mature. Though OpenAI, the market leader, is pulling in billions of dollars in yearly revenue, it is not profitable.\n\n(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/briefing/our-election-guide.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"07:04:19-05:00","title":"Our Election Guide","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This election guide covers key off-year races across the U.S., emphasizing their significance in reflecting voter sentiment during the second Trump administration.

But governors’ races and ballot measures still matter plenty.\n\n“They allow us to get a sense of where voter attitudes and energy are moving,” said Carolyn Ryan, a managing editor of The Times who used to run our Politics desk.\n\nWe were talking in her office in the center of the newsroom, with editors and reporters lined up outside to get her counsel. “They’ll deliver the best view yet of how voters are feeling and reacting to the first year of the second Trump administration,” she told me.\n\nThere are two possibilities for that view, and they could both end up being true.\n\nRepublicans want to see whether the gains Trump picked up among both young and nonwhite voters have cemented. That is particularly true of the contests in California, New Jersey, Virginia and Pennsylvania.\n\nDemocrats hope the results show that they are not still reeling from their loss of the White House in 2024, and that they can point to a path forward for 2028.\n\nHere’s what to watch for tomorrow.\n\nFor 15 years, California has used a nonpartisan commission to draw the map of congressional districts. That meant neither side got an advantage, even if it controlled the State House. It proved popular, and a number of states created similar commissions. But Trump has pushed red states to make new districts that favor Republicans so they can hold onto the majority in Congress.\n\nIn response, California’s leaders are asking voters to set aside the existing maps and replace them with ones drawn by Democratic lawmakers. The result could flip as many as five seats in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nRepublicans call it a power grab. Democrats call it part of a national effort to establish a check on the power of the Trump administration.\n\nCarolyn and Jess Bidgood, who hosts the On Politics newsletter (sign up!), call it a test measuring the desire of voters in states run by Democrats to take on the president. “In this hyperpartisan moment,” Jess said, “the real question is, Are voters willing to be hyperpartisan?”\n\nSee what the gerrymandered districts could look like.\n\nIt’s the new against the familiar in the mayoral race here, with Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani well ahead in the polls against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the activist, radio personality and former subway guardian Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani has promised to make the city affordable — and drawn fire from his rivals, as well as some Democrats, for left-wing views and criticism of Israel. Watch for a changing of the guard or a repudiation of an upstart. Trump has vowed to punish the city if Mamdani wins.\n\nHere are the latest polls on the race.\n\nSee the candidates’ stances on the issues.\n\nAnd these are the five key voting groups that could decide the election, including faith voters and young voters.\n\nThe governor’s race between Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat who has served in the House since 2019, and Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican businessman and former state legislator, is the one both Jess and Carolyn are watching most closely. It’s a nail-biter, with recent polls showing Sherrill’s lead slipping amid a lot of negative advertising. (Ciattarelli has accused Sherrill of misconduct during her time at the Naval Academy. Sherrill has accused Ciattarelli of spreading misinformation about opioids.) “The race has been a lot closer than many experts would have expected,” Carolyn said.\n\nThe state’s majority-Hispanic townships all swung for Trump. Tomorrow’s vote will test the durability of that rightward shift, our reporters write.\n\nThe people of Virginia typically vote for governors who are members of the party that’s not in the White House. No wonder the Democrat in this year’s race, Abigail Spanberger, a moderate former House representative, holds a significant polling lead over her Republican rival, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nSpanberger has built her campaign not on national issues, but on how much it costs to live and thrive in Virginia, which she argues has been disproportionately hurt by the government shutdown. But she’s also known to compromise. Earle-Sears, for her part, has secured only a lukewarm endorsement from Trump, who usually keeps his distance from Republicans he thinks will lose. “I haven’t been too much involved in Virginia,” Trump said.\n\nSo why watch this one? Two reasons. Whoever wins will be a barrier breaker: No woman has ever served as governor of Virginia. Second, as Jess pointed out, if Spanberger wins, some Democrats will say her campaign could provide a road map for Democrats in the midterms — and beyond.\n\nHere are the latest polls on the race.\n\nJustices are elected to 10-year terms on the State Supreme Court here, and Democrats hold a five-seat majority. But three Democrats are up for “retention” elections, meaning voters can send them home. The election to replace them would take place in 2027.\n\nThat doesn’t sound very exciting. (“True,” Jess told me.) But the outcome of the election could determine whether the seven-member court has a liberal majority during the 2028 presidential election. Jess said this matters because the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court is the highest court in the most important swing state in the country.\n\nRead more on why this election matters.\n\nI’ve got family in Maine and will be watching the results there closely. A proposal the state’s voters will take up tomorrow would eliminate two days of early absentee voting, require photo identification in order to vote, ban prepaid return envelopes for absentee ballots and limit drop boxes.\n\n“It’s pretty hard to convince voters to make the cumbersome process of voting harder,” Jess said. “So I think the vote will be a test of Trump’s rhetoric about rigging elections, about voter fraud, and how deeply that message has resonated with the electorate.”\n\nYou can follow all the election updates tomorrow on our website. Now, let’s get you caught up on the latest news.\n\nPresident Trump said the U.S. was not planning to go to war with Venezuela, but he suggested that it was time for the nation’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, to leave office.\n\nA federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot send in National Guard soldiers to Portland, Ore., for another few days, until she makes her final decision.\n\nThe nuclear testing ordered by Trump will not involve nuclear explosions, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.\n\nThe British police arrested a man after a stabbing rampage on a train injured 11 people. Officials said that it was not terrorism related, but offered no other potential motive.\n\nFrance used its trove of DNA profiles to find some of the Louvre suspects, showing the power of DNA databases for solving crimes.\n\nAn earthquake in northern Afghanistan killed at least 15 people. The quake struck near Mazar-i-Sharif, a city known for its magnificent Blue Mosque.\n\nXi Jinping, China’s leader, gave two cellphones to South Korea’s president, who asked how secure they were. His answer: “You can check if there’s a backdoor.”\n\nA massacre is unfolding in Sudan, and the world is largely looking away, my colleague Declan Walsh writes in The World.\n\nTwo Kenyans won the men’s and women’s races in the New York City Marathon: Benson Kipruto — by three hundredths of a second — and Hellen Obiri.\n\nThere was an explosion at Harvard Medical School, but officials said it only damaged a small section of a hallway.\n\nRegardless what polling on single issues might suggest, Americans are moderate.

Out was a roast chicken and green salad. Here came “A Light Summer Dinner for Eight to Ten” or “A Hawaiian Luau for Twenty,” all accompanied by beautiful antiques, copious candles, miles of jacquard.\n\nThe book was equal measure camp and goal-setting, as my old pal Julia Moskin writes today: “an odd hybrid of a professional catering manual, an aspirational but practical cookbook and celebrity lifestyle porn.”\n\nIt remains so today, as Martha’s publisher issues a reprint this week. Julia uses the new edition to take measure of what’s changed for Martha, for our cooking, for our kitchens and cookbooks and dining rooms. For more than four decades, Martha has been a hero — and, to some, a cartoon villain. She has always argued, Julia writes, “that domestic goddess is a role worth striving for — a creative and professional project akin to directing a movie or building an app.”\n\n“I wanted to be a homemaker,” Martha told her in an interview. “I wasn’t a housewife or a housekeeper. I wanted to make a home.”\n\nThe novelist Peter Orner has a lovely review of John Irving’s latest, “Queen Esther,” a novel that returns readers to the world and the characters of “The Cider House Rules,” from 1985. That’s welcome news to Orner. “I needed this dose of old-school New England decency,” he writes. “Few skewer sanctimony quite like Irving at his best. More important: I fell in love, once again, with his people.” I’m in!\n\n“There’s an inherent theatricality to church,” writes the critic Alissa Wilkinson, “and a furtive spirituality to theater. In form, they’re similar: Everybody crowds into a room, usually sits facing the same direction, and focuses on a central action — at least for a while.” Alissa uses those parallels to explore a number of recent shows that dance between art and religion. It’s smart.\n\nHere’s a new recipe that you may well bake on repeat from now through the end of the year. It’s for salted butterscotch chocolate chunk cookies — essentially chocolate chip cookies that have been discovered by Hollywood and cast in the next season of “The White Lotus,” cookies that might date a financier or a basketball star. Crisp edges, chewy centers and intense butterscotch flavor pair beautifully with crunchy toffee and soft chocolate chunks under a scattering of flaky sea salt.

2025-11-03T08:09:08-05:00\n\nThe Torre dei Conti, a medieval tower near Rome’s famed Colosseum, partially collapsed on Monday, seriously injuring a worker, according to the Italian news agency, ANSA.\n\nTwo others sustained minor injuries in the collapse, ANSA reported. At least one other person was trapped under the rubble, Luca Cari, a spokesman for Rome’s fire department, said.\n\nThe group was part of a team conducting restoration work on the tower, which has not been open to the public since 2006.\n\nIn videos posted to social media, clouds of dust billow from the scene amid the roar of collapsing stone.\n\nWorkers were on scaffolding when an initial collapse took place, according to ANSA, and had to be rescued by a Fire Department ladder truck.

No Guards Were Punished.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T03:00:07-05:00\n\nErnastiaze Moore had been an inmate at Sullivan Correctional Facility in upstate New York for 11 days, he said, when an officer there gave him an ominous warning: “We are going to show you how we do it up in Sullivan.”\n\nSoon after, in January 2023, Mr. Moore was in his cell when guards blasted him with pepper spray, burst in, beat him bloody and brought him to a so-called frisk room, where, he said, they groped his genitals and shoved fingers into his anus.\n\nAfterward, Mr. Moore needed surgery to reconstruct his left eye socket, records show. He reported what happened as a case of sexual assault and, in September, he filed a federal civil rights lawsuit accusing the guards of sexual abuse, excessive force and other offenses.\n\nMr. Moore, who was five years into a 21-year sentence for attempted murder and attempted assault, is one of scores of New York State prisoners who have complained over the years about being mistreated by guards. But his claims have emerged at a time of intense scrutiny for the prisons, where, in the past year, two inmates were beaten to death by guards in separate attacks. Those incidents led a state prosecutor to take the rare step of bringing criminal charges against 20 of the guards involved.\n\nThe outcome of Mr. Moore’s internal complaints, however, was more familiar: The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision deemed them to be unfounded, and the guards who were involved were not punished.\n\nA spokesman for the department, Thomas Mailey, said an internal investigation had found that the guards did not insert anything into Mr. Moore’s anus and that their handling of him had been “consistent with the type and amount of force justifiably used and reported by staff.”\n\nWhat sets Mr. Moore’s case apart from others like it was that much of what happened to him was recorded on a hand-held camera by a corrections officer who was required under departmental policy to film the encounter, known in the system as a “cell extraction.”\n\nA New York Times review of the video shows that the episode began with one guard calmly explaining that officers were about to remove Mr. Moore from his cell because they believed he had a knife. (Ultimately no weapon was recovered.)\n\nThe Times has annotated portions of the video, which is about 25 minutes long, showing key moments as the encounter unfolded. Some of the scenes include graphic imagery.\n\nFirst, one guard shoots pepper spray into the cell and four guards in black tactical gear rush in.\n\nIt is impossible to see what the guards do to Mr. Moore as they pile on top of him, and a supervising officer blocks the camera’s view. But when Mr. Moore emerges from the cell, his hands are cuffed behind his back, his left eye is swollen shut and blood is dripping down his face.\n\nMr. Moore tells the officers he is unable to walk and that he is suffering from back pain. (At another point in the video, he says he has multiple sclerosis, although he acknowledges not being diagnosed with it.) They put him on a stretcher and take him to the frisk room.\n\n“You’re going to stand up, you’re going to get stripped, you hear me?” a guard yells at him.\n\nInside the room, his face against the wall, the guards order Mr. Moore, who is bleeding, to take off his T-shirt, then his pants and shoes and then one sock at a time. They tell him to sit on a “boss chair” — a body-orifice scanner.\n\nShortly after he is made to stand again, they turn him around, look into his mouth and then tell him to face the wall.\n\n“Lean against the corner,” a guard says. “Drop your boxers.”\n\nOne guard turns toward the others and makes a hand gesture, and one of them responds with a similar gesture.\n\nThe guard says he has found “a string hanging from the anus area.”\n\nAs Mr. Moore objects and falls to the floor, the footage becomes jerky and chaotic. Mr. Moore can be heard screaming six times that officers are punching him in the face, and that the guards are forcibly touching his genitals and anus.\n\nThe sergeant supervising the search repeatedly tells Mr. Moore to “stop resisting,” although Mr. Moore does not appear to be doing so.\n\nA spatter of blood is visible on the wall behind him as an officer discards Mr. Moore’s bloodstained underwear and is handed a new pair.\n\nIn the end, they did not find anything hidden in his body.\n\nMr. Moore said in an interview that he was just “trying to survive” during the strip search.\n\n“I was hopeless — like dang, nobody ever did this to me before,” he said. “It was just frustration and anger.”\n\nAfterward, the guards threw away Mr. Moore’s bloodied boxer shorts. Mr. Mailey, the Corrections Department spokesman, said the underwear was not considered evidence and was “contaminated with chemical agents as well as blood.” He added that any bleeding from Mr. Moore’s anus was caused by Mr. Moore himself, accusing him of trying to hide an unspecified item in his body, and not by guards.\n\nMr. Moore’s lawyers accused the guards of disposing of evidence.\n\n“This is part of a systemic pattern where correctional officers are protected, not punished, regardless of the harm inflicted,” one of the lawyers, Nicholas Liakas, said in a statement.\n\nThe guards took other steps to cover up what they had done, the lawyers said. When members of the prison’s medical staff examined Mr. Moore alongside his cell, they remained present and even threatened him with more violence if he reported what had happened, the lawsuit said.\n\nThree months later, after a nurse filed the sexual assault complaint on Mr. Moore’s behalf, the guards referred him to the mental health observation unit, where one of the officers who had participated in the episode was stationed, the lawsuit says.\n\nEventually, after Mr. Moore went on a weekslong hunger strike to draw attention to his case, the prison system’s internal investigators interviewed him, the lawsuit says.\n\nTwo days later, two officers cornered him in the shower, called him a racial slur and said they knew he had been speaking with investigators, the suit says. They put him in handcuffs, beat him and pinned him to the floor, the suit says. Then they shoved what Mr. Moore believed to be either a pen or a radio antenna into his rectum as one of the guards said: “Are you going to stop reporting me now?”\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Mailey said the Corrections Department had reviewed those accusations as well and had found evidence, including medical evidence, video footage “and/or witnesses,” that refuted them.\n\nSullivan Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison for men about 50 miles west of Poughkeepsie, has been singled out for high rates of abuse by the Correctional Association of New York, a state watchdog group. In 2022, a representative of the organization testified at a hearing that about one in five inmates there had reported being treated violently or abused by staff members.\n\nThe prison was closed last fall amid a declining inmate population and as part of the state’s budget plan to reduce the number of penitentiaries in New York.\n\nMr. Moore is now being held at Mid-State Correctional Facility, the prison where one of the two men killed by guards, 22-year-old Messiah Nantwi, was fatally beaten in March.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/02/upshot/ten-minute-challenge-flowers.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:07:16-05:00","title":"10-Minute Challenge: A Vase of Flowers","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article presents 'A Vase of Flowers' by Dutch artist Margareta Haverman, painted in 1716, as a focus for a 10-minute art observation challenge.

2025-11-02T20:07:16-05:00\n\nToday, we bring you another focus challenge, in which we invite you to spend uninterrupted time looking at a piece of art. The Dutch artist Margareta Haverman painted “A Vase of Flowers” over 300 hundred years ago, in 1716.\n\n(These challenges are published on the first Monday of each month. Sign up here if you’d like to be notified.)\n\nHow does the artist use color to guide your eye through the bouquet?\n\nAfter spending some time with it, do you feel any different?\n\nYou made it time. If you want to look a little longer, just scroll back up and press “Continue.”\n\nThere’s a story about an ancient Greek painter named Zeuxis who, in a painting contest with a rival, painted grapes that looked so realistic the birds flew down and tried to eat them.\n\nAs I looked at these grapes by Margareta Haverman at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last week, I could imagine birds breaking through the ceiling, and swooping right in.\n\nA technical analysis of the painting revealed Haverman used up to seven layers of paint on the grapes, some added while the previous layer was still wet, to achieve the effect — evidence of an artist looking for the perfect form.\n\nEverywhere your eyes look, they encounter a torrent of detail. The intricate layers of the flower petals,\n\nthe shine of the water droplets and the veins on the leaves.\n\nThe leaves are bluer now than they would have been in 1716 because the yellow pigment Haverman used faded over time. Even with this bluer cast, there is a wide range of color: shocking reds, paler blues, bright whites, deep purples.\n\nYou can picture Haverman in her studio with this set up in front of her, looking, sketching and painting, racing against the clock before her beautiful bouquet wilts and dies. (Remember, it’s 1716: She can’t take a photograph.)\n\n“This bouquet could never exist in reality,” said Adam Eaker, assistant curator in the Department of European Paintings at the Met. “These flowers don’t bloom at the same time of year, so Haverman would have slowly pieced this work together on the basis of individual studies.”\n\nIn all, there are 30 different types of fruit and flowers, two species of butterfly, five other types of insects and a couple of garden snails:\n\nFlowers and fruit: 1) opium poppy foliage 2) cabbage rose 3) alyssum 4) pot marigold 5) forget-me-not 6) dwarf morning glory 7) white rose 8) lilac auricula 9) red catchfly 10) light blue hyacinth 11) hollyhock 12) passion flower 13) saxifrage 14) meadow grass 15) Maltese cross 16) New York aster 17) Persian tulip hybrid 18) pepperwort 19) tulip “baguette” 20) English iris 21) white hyacinth 22) brown violet auricula 23) feverfew 24) sweet sultan 25) African marigold 26) jasmine 27) apple 28) violet auricula 29) white grapes 30) black grapes. Butterflies: a) heath fritillary b) red admiral. Other insects: c) lesser house fly d) yellow meadow ant e) bluebottle fly f) black ant g) garden bumblebee Snails: h) garden snail\n\nThis is one of two surviving works of Haverman’s. Little is known about her life, but we do know that she learned these techniques from a highly regarded flower painter, Jan van Huysum. This is a van Huysum from 1715:\n\nCan you see the similarities between Haverman (left) and van Huysum (right)?\n\nHaverman learned fast. She was good. Van Huysum was jealous. A 1751 biography of the eccentric and secretive van Huysum (who came from a family of painters and wouldn’t even let his brothers see the inside of his studio) notes that Haverman’s “prowess aroused Jan’s envy to such a degree that he longed to be rid of her.” Female painters were rare and often needed a family connection to get into the field. (Haverman’s father helped persuade van Huysum to take her on.) Many were relegated to still life painting because they weren’t allowed to study the nude models.\n\nStill, Haverman excelled. That same biography notes she learned “not only to copy [Van Huysum’s] paintings but also to paint beautifully from life; even to the amazement of connoisseurs, who came to see her work.”\n\nEventually, van Huysum found a reason to drop her as his student. (It was described at the time as a “misdeed.”)\n\nHer self-assurance is clear in the decisions she makes — see how the dark background causes that streak of white flowers to push even more to the fore, providing a central anchor for your eye.\n\nZoom in (you may need to get up close) and you can just make out her signature at the bottom, appearing almost etched into the plinth.\n\n“I love the confidence of her signature and the strange sculptural ornamentation of the vase, lurking in the shadows,” Mr. Eaker said. “I think the signature gives a wonderful sense both of Haverman’s confidence as an artist and her skill at crafting an illusion.”\n\nFlower painting like this was common in the Netherlands. Even a hundred years earlier, artists like Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder were setting similarly striped tulips in arrangements in front of landscape backgrounds:\n\nAround this time, in the early 1600s, so-called “tulip mania” hit the Netherlands. The tulip was the new flower on the scene — introduced to the Netherlands via the Ottoman Empire — and were highly desired by the wealthy Dutch (among the wealthiest in the world), according to the Amsterdam Tulip Museum. In the craze, the price of tulip bulbs were bid up and up (selling in one case for more than a Rembrandt painting), creating what some describe as the first financial bubble. Eventually the bubble burst and tulip prices came crashing down, leaving some tulip speculators bankrupt.\n\nTulip mania was later followed by the hyacinth mania of the 1700s. Haverman included blue and white varieties of hyacinth in our painting:\n\nThere’s a temptation to want to extract symbolism or meaning from these flowers, and maybe Haverman painted some parts of this bouquet not at their peak but in decay to remind us of the fragility of life.\n\n“Some flowers do have symbolic meaning, but flower paintings generally weren’t meant to be ‘decoded,’” Mr. Eaker said.\n\nAnd in the end, the bouquet of flowers you bought from the corner store last weekend will die.\n\nThis painting — with the help of art conservators — will live.\n\nThese are objects for close looking and admiration, Mr. Eaker said. “Particularly on a cold gray Dutch winter’s day.”\n\nSign up to be notified when new installments are published here.

And there is grave concern for the thousands unaccounted for.\n\n“Our question is very simple: Where are they? Where are the rest? It’s extremely concerning and disturbing,” Sylvain Penicaud, head of the Doctors Without Borders hospital in Tawila, said by phone. ”Our fear is that these people have been detained for extortion or got killed.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

2025-11-02T13:04:11-05:00\n\nMaria Riva, an actress and author who was the only child of Marlene Dietrich, the audacious, androgynous and libidinous Teutonic screen siren and cabaret star — and whose bombshell biography of her mother, published a year after her death in 1992, explored the terrible cost of her fame — died on Wednesday in Gila, N.M. She was 100.\n\nHer son Peter confirmed the death, at his home, where she had been living for the last year and a half.\n\nMs. Riva was born in Berlin; her father, Rudolph Sieber, was a dashing assistant director who had cast Dietrich as an extra in one of her first film roles. They married in 1923. As her mother’s career took off, Ms. Riva grew up mostly in Hollywood, on the Paramount Pictures backlots.\n\nSchool was out of the question; Dietrich considered the English language vulgar and Americans even more so, and in any case she wanted her daughter — “The Child,” as she referred to her — by her side, as handmaiden and personal assistant.\n\nIt was Josef von Sternberg, the Vienna-born director who was Dietrich’s Svengali and lover — he had made her an international star, and won her a Hollywood contract, with “The Blue Angel” (1930), the first of their seven films together — who taught Ms. Riva some useful American words and phrases, among them “soundstage,” “makeup” and “wardrobe department.”\n\nShe grew skilled at caring for her mother’s costumes and props, at stamping her autograph on publicity photos, and at staying quiet on set. Dietrich’s costume designer made her a special uniform and gave her a title: “attendant to Miss Marlene.” For years, she thought “Maria Daughter of Marlene Dietrich” was her proper name; she was also never quite sure of her age, which changed as often as that of her mother, who regularly shaved off the years.\n\nFamily life, to say the least, was unusual. Mr. Sieber, who was based in Paris, would arrive now and then with his cowed Russian mistress, Tami, in tow, to oversee Dietrich’s finances and Ms. Riva’s deportment and to archive his wife’s letters — all of her letters, most of which were from her lovers, which arrived in droves and Dietrich often read aloud. Ms. Riva loved those visits, because it meant affection from Tami, the nurturer in the ménage, who played nanny to Ms. Riva and housekeeper to her parents.\n\n“Dietrich was the queen,” Ms. Riva told The Los Angeles Times in 1994. “My father was her major-domo, her lovers were her suitors, and I was the lady in waiting. I didn’t think it was strange; I had nothing to compare it to.”\n\nNo school meant no companions her own age. Those she counted as friends were the least obsequious of Dietrich’s lovers — the English actor Brian Aherne, who sneaked her copies of Shakespeare plays, was a particular favorite — and her bodyguards, who were in constant attendance after a kidnapping threat following the murder of Charles Lindbergh’s baby. One of them gave her a frog as a pet.\n\nWhen she was about 12, she had her first encounter with actual children, an invitation to Judy Garland’s birthday party. She was terrified: What did real children do together? She and Judy huddled on the porch and bonded over their strange, caged existence, while the guests, none of whom were known to the birthday girl, proved adept at the current youth vernacular and a mysterious game called spin the bottle.\n\nUntil Ms. Riva was a teenager, her mother’s many male and female suitors left the house before dawn, keeping up the ruse, for The Child, that they were just good pals. (In those early years, to name just a few, the cast included Mr. von Sternberg, Maurice Chevalier, Gary Cooper, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and the poet and playwright Mercedes de Acosta, who was also a lover of Greta Garbo’s.)\n\nThey often reappeared in the morning, freshly dressed in their street clothes, for breakfast. Dietrich was as enthusiastic about her cooking as her nighttime adventures. But the pantomime must have grown exhausting to all the players, Ms. Riva assumed, as her mother began billeting her with governesses in hotels and rented houses.\n\nDietrich’s sexual adventures were the stuff of legend — from Gen. George S. Patton to Colette to Adlai Stevenson — with a cast that expanded through the decades.   During a stint in London, Ms. Riva wrote, there might be Michael Arlen for breakfast, Christopher Fry for lunch, Kenneth Tynan for tea and “a sexy new Swedish blonde to supper.”\n\nJohn Wayne, with whom Dietrich starred in three films in the early 1940s, was an outlier, seemingly impervious to her charms. Years later, he told Ms. Riva, who asked him why he didn’t succumb: “Never liked being part of a stable.”\n\nDespite all the action, Dietrich was not a fan of the act itself. At least not with men. She preferred fellatio, or, better, impotent men. “They are nice,” she told her daughter. “You can sleep and it’s cozy.”\n\nMs. Riva’s nights were not so cozy. One governess-companion raped her repeatedly, most nights, for over a year. Ms. Riva became a teenage alcoholic, and suicidal. She married, briefly, in her late teens.\n\nBy age 20, Ms. Riva was divorced, still drinking heavily and drifting, as she put it, in San Francisco, where she worked for a kindly drag performer. (Her mother was in Europe with General Patton’s First Army.) She was good at her job: As she put it, “A trained-by-Dietrich dresser can function very nicely as handmaiden to a female impersonator of Sophie Tucker.” He cared for her, fed her and housed her for a time — she had been living on ketchup and bourbon — but she began hoarding sleeping pills and still had suicidal thoughts.\n\nBut then a friend handed her a copy of “The Neurotic Personality of Our Time,” the groundbreaking book by Karen Horney, the German psychoanalyst and anti-Freudian, that examined the societal underpinnings of emotional suffering. She said it saved her life.\n\n“I found myself in it,” she told The Chicago Tribune in 1993, and it made her feel less alone.\n\nMs. Riva got sober, moved to New York City and began to work, hard, as an actor. She joined a U.S.O. company and toured Europe until the war ended, whereupon she returned to New York. She met William Riva, a set designer, while she was directing a play with the producer Albert McCleery at Fordham University. They fell in love, and they married in 1947.\n\nThough she disapproved of the marriage, Dietrich was a relentless presence in the Riva household, dictatorial in the nursery after the birth of their first child, Michael, in 1948. Yet when Life magazine put Dietrich on the cover that August, proclaiming her “The Most Glamorous Grandmother,” she was annoyed. “It automatically makes my age a subject for great discussion,” she told The New York Times in 1952. “That is ridiculous. It is quite common to have grandchildren at 35.” She was 51 at the time.\n\n“What is it like, to have a mother no one knows?” Ms. Riva later wrote. “Must be nice.”\n\nMaria Elizabeth Sieber was born in Berlin on Dec. 13, 1924. But it wasn’t until her father’s death in 1976, when she found her birth certificate among his papers, that she learned how old she really was. (He and Dietrich never divorced.)\n\nMs. Riva did get a bit of schooling for a few years at a Swiss finishing school; Dietrich, as was her habit, phoned her daughter incessantly, pulling her out of exams and hockey games, clearly suffering from the absence of her handmaiden. Ms. Riva also studied acting at the director Max Reinhardt’s workshop in Hollywood.\n\nAfter her marriage, Ms. Riva became a prolific television actor, under contract to CBS, appearing in more than 500 teleplays and a number of commercials. She also toured in theatrical productions. But when her fourth son, David, was born in 1961, she gave up acting to focus on her family, though she continued to participate in telethons for cerebral palsy, volunteer work she had embarked on at the urging of Yul Brynner (another Dietrich swain). She also produced her mother’s cabaret act as long as Dietrich was able to perform.\n\nIn addition to her son Peter, Ms. Riva is survived two other sons, Paul and David; eight grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. William Riva died in 1999. Their son Michael died in 2012.\n\nDietrich’s final years were spent alone in a squalid Paris apartment, though not because of penury or neglect: She didn’t like visitors, and, crippled by various ailments, she was lax about hygiene and often used random housewares as bedpans. She passed her days on the phone with her fans and old lovers, sedated by a cocktail of pills, alcohol and quack medicines, spinning fantasies and upending truths, tending to the legend as best she could.\n\nIn 1993, a year after Dietrich’s death at 90, Ms. Riva published “Marlene Dietrich,” a book years in the making, mostly to critical acclaim and enormous publicity.\n\nMolly Haskell, writing in The Times, called it “the ultimate act of demystification, a startling and riveting work.”\n\n“I think those of us who live with great fame have to say that it is a trick of survival and that a lot of us don’t like it,” Ms. Riva told Diane Sawyer in a 1993 television interview. Writing the book, she said, was a necessity.\n\n“Power must not be allowed to triumph all the time,” Ms. Riva said, recalling her virtual servitude as a child. “It mustn’t be forgiven no matter what it does, because it’s beautiful, because it’s famous, because it’s powerful.”\n\n"}]}
