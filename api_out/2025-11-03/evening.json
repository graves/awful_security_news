safe to fly during the government shutdown? Here’s what aviation experts say \n       \n  By Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:41 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air traffic controllers not showing up to work or taking second jobs to make ends meet, coupled with long lines at the airport and delays, understandably heighten the anxieties of some passengers.\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of the shutdown, controllers and other essential workers, like Transportation Security Administration screeners, have been required to do their jobs but won’t be paid until after the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  The union representing controllers believes the longer the shutdown drags on, the more risks are introduced into the system.\n \n\n   \n  “Every single day that this goes on tomorrow is now less safe than today,” said Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association on CNN News Central. “We’re supposed to go to work and be 100%, 100% of the time. I’m going to work right now, and I’m thinking about, how do I pay my rent?”\n \n\n   \n  For over 34 days, the federal government has been shut down. For travelers, the shutdown has caused some TSA wait times and flight delays to skyrocket.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said, those delays are one way controllers are keeping passengers safe. Flights are slowed down so the employees who showed up to work can manage them.\n \n\n   \n  “Is there more risk in the system when you have a shutdown? Absolutely there’s more risk,” he said on CNBC Monday. “If we thought that it was unsafe… we’ll shut the whole airspace down. We won’t let people travel. We’re not there at this point. It’s just significant delays,”\n \n\n   \n    Compromising predictability\n \n\n   \n  For some, like Erik Hansen senior vice president of government relations at the US Travel Association, a shutdown compromises the reliability of air travel.\n \n\n   \n  “The challenge is that the system is never going to compromise safety, but we’re absolutely compromising predictability and the ability of Americans to get to where they want to go on time,” Hansen said.\n \n\n   \n  Shortages have been widespread across the country in places like Chicago, Denver, Houston and Newark causing ground delays and disrupting passengers.\n \n\n   \n  Controllers who aren’t able to focus on the job under these trying circumstances should call out sick, Mike McCormick an assistant professor of Air Traffic Management at Embry-Riddle University, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “If controllers were more reporting to work in such a condition that they could not be 100%, for their air traffic control duties, then, yes, that creates a risk of safety,” McCormick said. “From what I’m seeing across the system, controllers are recognizing their limitations, and they’re not reporting to work, so that is actually helping to keep the system safe.”\n \n\n   \n    Stressful jobs become even more stressful\n \n\n   \n  Houston’s Bush Intercontinental Airport is warning passengers it could take three hours to get though TSA checkpoints due to staffing shortages. Long lines snaked around the terminal Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “Call-outs will continue to rise in TSA, because those frontline employees are forced with making those decisions,” said Keith Jeffries, vice president of K2 Security Screening Group and a former TSA federal security director at Los Angeles International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries believes it is still safe to fly but knows there’s going to be delays. He thinks the aviation transportation system will see a “domino effect,” as the turmoil of the shutdown lingers.\n \n\n   \n  “Flying is safe, but you know you’re going to have, certainly, front line employees, are they thinking about that next bill that is due, and they can’t afford to pay it? Or are they focused on looking for dangerous, prohibited items? You can make that argument,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Union leaders and most major airlines have said the answer is not complicated, Congress to end the shutdown so controllers and TSA workers can be paid.\n \n\n   \n  “Our message is simple, open the government, and it has to open now,” Daniels said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-cuomo-new-york-mayor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:36:00-05:00","title":"Trump Urges New Yorkers to Vote for Cuomo for Mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, a Queens native, publicly urged New Yorkers to vote for former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the 2025 mayoral race, calling him capable and criticizing Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, whom he falsely labeled a communist.

Andrew Cuomo in the city’s mayoral race on the eve of the election.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job,” the president wrote on Truth Social on Monday, adding that Cuomo “is capable of it” and that Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani “is not!”\n \n\n   \n  His backing of Cuomo, whom he described as having a “Record of Success,” could hurt the former governor with Democrats as much as it helps him with Republicans in deep-blue New York City. Mamdani, who shocked Cuomo in June’s Democratic primary, has repeatedly tied the former governor to Trump and argued that he would stand up to powerful interests in both New York and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, a Queens native, has long complained about Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, and falsely labeled him a communist. He again vowed to pull federal funds from the city if Mamdani wins Tuesday “other than the very minimum as required.”\n \n\n   \n  The president previously offered tepid support for Cuomo, casting the election as a choice between the better of two bad options, while discounting the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a fan of Cuomo one way or another, but if it’s going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,” Trump told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani quickly seized on Trump’s comments in that interview, posting his congratulations to Cuomo on X on Sunday and adding, “I know how hard you worked for this.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican president discouraged voters from backing Sliwa, though he’s stopped short of explicitly demanding the Republican nominee leave the race as other Cuomo backers have.\n \n\n   \n  “A vote for Curtis Sliwa (who looks much better without the beret!) is a vote for Mamdani,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Surveys of likely voters have been  largely consistent i n showing Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, with Sliwa in third. They differ on the precise scope of Mamdani’s advantage, although most have found him shy of clearing a majority of support in the race.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a Trump ally, also endorsed Cuomo on Monday over Mamdani and Sliwa. “Bear in mind that a vote for Curtis is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he purchased in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani also reacted to Trump’s comments later Monday at a canvas event in his Assembly district in Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “The MAGA movement’s embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump’s understanding that this would be the best mayor for him. Not the best mayor for New York City, not the best mayor for New Yorkers, but the best mayor for Donald Trump and his administration,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has  a long history  with Trump dating back to his time as governor prior to his 2021 resignation facing sexual harassment allegations that he’s denied. The two tussled during the Covid-19 pandemic with often-dueling press briefings. But the former New York governor has presented his dealings with Trump as a plus for New York City, arguing that Mamdani is too inexperienced to handle the president.\n \n\n   \n  “You will hear from Andrew Cuomo about his experience as if the issue is that we don’t know about it,” Mamdani retorted  during one debate . “The issue is that we have all experienced your experience.”\n \n\n   \n  The president — who’s holding telerallies for Virginia and New Jersey audiences Monday night — had his focus trained on the Empire State on social media, lashing out at Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who campaigned with Mamdani over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  He accused her of “killing the entire region with Energy Prices that are OUT OF CONTROL” and said he’d ask Transportation Secretary Dean Duffy “to take a good, long look at terminating New York City Congestion Pricing.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-social-media-james-comey-letitia-james","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00-05:00","title":"Justice Department defends Lindsey Halligan and Trump’s social media posts targeting James Comey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Justice Department has defended both the appointment of Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney and the charges against James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, asserting that President Donald Trump’s social media posts do not indicate a targeted effort to prosecute Comey for criticizing him.

Far from it,” they continued. “The President’s social-media posts are clear on why he thinks the defendant should be prosecuted: he thinks the defendant is ‘guilty as hell.’”\n \n\n   \n  The crux of Comey’s argument is that Trump has made no secret of his vitriol for him during the president’s yearlong vendetta against the FBI for its investigation into Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has focused his animosity on Comey, his attorneys argued, citing an extraordinary list of public statements in which Trump called him a liar and suggested he should be investigated and prosecuted.\n \n\n   \n  But the “smoking-gun evidence,” defense attorneys said, was Trump’s  social media post  days before an indictment was handed up declaring Comey was “guilty as hell” and demanding of the Attorney General that “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors rebuffed the argument, saying that Trump has long showed his belief that Comey should be criminally charged. In fact, they said, Trump had accused Comey of committing a crime even before the former director began publicly criticizing him.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump’s repeated posts suggest he “disfavors” Comey, prosecutors said, many of them also show that Trump believed Comey “leaked information” and “lie[d] under oath” – the same allegations that comprise the case against him. Therefore, they argued, it would take “contrived reading” of those posts to conclude Trump wanted Comey charged because of his criticism of the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of giving false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding\n \n\n   \n    DOJ defends Halligan’s appointment\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department in a separate Monday filing  defended the legitimacy of the prosecutor  who Comey’s indictment, as well as the indictment of  New York Attorney General Letitia James . The department argued the Interim US Attorney for Northern Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, is lawfully serving in a role she was appointed to.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge is weighing bids by Comey and James to have their charges thrown out based on their claim that Halligan, who convinced federal grand juries to approve the charges against Comey and James, is not lawfully serving in the position.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan was tapped for the post after Trump pushed out the former interim US attorney, Erik Siebert. Both Comey and James claim Siebert had already served the legally allotted maximum of 120 days that someone can serve on a temporary basis before needing to be confirmed by the Senate and that Halligan’s appointment after those 120 days had passed means that Trump was not legally able to appoint a new interim attorney and avoid the Senate confirmation process.\n \n\n   \n  But in court papers submitted Monday, the Justice Department pushed back strongly on those assertions and told US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie that even if she were to conclude Halligan is not lawfully serving in her role, the two indictments should not be tossed out altogether.\n \n\n   \n  “Even were Ms. Halligan’s appointment invalid, the motions to dismiss should be denied. While Defendants challenge Ms. Halligan’s appointment as interim US Attorney, the actions they challenge do not hinge on her validly holding that particular office,” the Justice Department wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The government attorneys argue that federal law does not bar the attorney general from appointing a new interim US attorney after 120 days “if a new vacancy arises.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Attorney General must revisit her interim appointments every 120 days. They do not automatically renew,” they wrote. “At the same time, Congress did not hamstring the Attorney General with an artificial, one-time-only appointment window.”\n \n\n   \n  Currie is set to hear arguments over Halligan’s authority next week. Three other judges around the country have concluded that a trio of Trump’s choices for US attorney in other districts are serving unlawfully.\n \n\n   \n  Should James and Comey succeed in persuading the judge that Halligan was unlawfully appointed, it could doom both cases since Halligan was the only prosecutor to sign the indictments.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ defends Letitia James subpoena\n \n\n   \n  In a separate filing, the Justice Department on Monday defended its subpoenas to James, the New York attorney general, seeking records relating to civil investigations into the Trump Organization and National Rifle Association.\n \n\n   \n  James had  moved to quash the subpoenas , which were issued in August, saying they are overly broad, infringe on state rights, and are invalid because they are signed by John Sarcone, the US attorney for the Northern District of New York, who they say is serving unlawfully.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department in its filing,  which was unsealed on Monday , said that motion should be denied.\n \n\n   \n  “Acting United States Attorney John A. Sarcone III’s status in that role is irrelevant. The grand jury can issue subpoenas, and AUSAs and special attorneys (like Mr. Sarcone) can conduct grand jury investigations, regardless of the status of the United States Attorney. In any event, Mr. Sarcone is validly serving as Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of New York,” prosecutors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In support of its position, DOJ also points to a New York State appellate judge’s dissenting opinion in the civil fraud case. Trump did not raise the issue of selective prosecution in his appeal of the civil fraud case. But the judge wrote that James brought the lawsuit “out of partisan political motives.”\n \n\n   \n  James’ lawyers have said the investigation was launched after Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen testified before Congress alleging values for properties were manipulated.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ also wrote that the subpoena was sent to the office of the attorney general “no individual, including Attorney General James, have been identified as targets of the investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  James has pleaded not guilty to charges related to an investigation into alleged mortgage fraud.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/entertainment/huda-mustafa-olandria-carthen-racial-slur","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00-05:00","title":"‘Love Island’ Cast Keeps Making Terrible Messes: Huda Beauty Ends Partnership with Huda Mustafa Over Racial Slur Incident","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A live stream incident involving 'Love Island USA' contestants Huda Mustafa and Louis Russell, where a viewer used a racial slur against Olandria Carthen, led to widespread public backlash.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “Love Island USA” season 7 continues to bring the drama even months after the season concluded.\n \n\n   \n  Huda Beauty has ended its relationship with one of the show’s alums, Huda Mustafa (who is not related to the company, despite the names).\n \n\n   \n  The split came after a recent live stream in which Mustafa and her boyfriend, Louis Russell, laughed following a viewer calling her fellow “Love Island USA” contestant Olandria Carthen a racial slur.\n \n\n   \n  The pair quickly ended the call with Mustafa saying, “Yo, what the f**k? What did they say? They said a bad word” to which Russell, who was a contestant on Netflix’s “Too Hot To Handle” and “Perfect Match,” responded “They said a terrible word.”\n \n\n   \n  The moment went viral and the popular beauty brand recently posted on social media that “At Huda Beauty, kindness and humanity are at the heart of what we do.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are truly disappointed by Huda Mustafa’s recent live and we take all forms of racism very seriously,” the statement reads. “While we don’t believe her actions reflect her character, we found them deeply upsetting.”\n \n\n   \n  The company captioned their two page statement “This action was taken not because of any creator or influencers content, this was taken due to the lack of seriousness around the issue and to people close to us who were offended by the actions during the live. Please remember this is about accountability not canceling people.”\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Huda Beauty’s statement both Mustafa and Russell issued apologies.\n \n\n   \n  But it was Mustafa’s first statement posted on her Instagram stories that caused the hubbub to escalate. To some, it sounded like she was down-playing the incident, by saying she and Russell “did not hear it very well” when the person used the slur.\n \n\n   \n  A second statement, also posted on her stories, acknowledged that she had initially missed the mark with her first statement and offered a direct apology to Carthen.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to begin by saying I completely respect Olandria and it’s extremely disheartening that anyone, especially a presumed child, would find it excusable to use this type of language, and doing so only underlines the ignorance of the gravity that such a word carries. Olandria – it is now clear that this comment was targeted at you, and I apologize for my immediate reaction,” Mustafa wrote. “My reaction in that moment came from being caught off guard, not from finding the word or situation funny. It was a nervous, uncomfortable reaction that I recognize was inappropriate.”\n \n\n   \n  Russell also issued a statement writing “I’d like to extend my sincerest apology to all those affected by the caller who used language that completely goes against everything we stand for.”\n \n\n   \n  “As a Black man, I have a greater empathy through my own lived experiences battling racism and the idea that a flustered response to a very unnerving situation could be misinterpreted for me not taking the matter seriously is incredibly disheartening,” he wrote. “This was an extremely unfortunate situation, one that in no way reflects my values, not Huda’s.”\n \n\n   \n  Carthen also took to social media to express her feelings, writing that she does not “condone racism of any kind, nor do I entertain it.”\n \n\n   \n  “That kind of language is never acceptable,” she wrote. “Not in anger, not as a joke, not ever. Words like that carry generations of pain, and pretending otherwise only keeps the cycle going. Defending it, laughing about it, or making excuses is even worse.”\n \n\n   \n  Carthen encouraged her followers “to donate to organizations dedicated to educating and uplifting the Black community like UNCF, NAACP and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.”\n \n\n   \n  It was not the first time that Mustafa and Carthen have faced off regarding racism.\n \n\n   \n  During the reunion show which aired in August, Carthen took Mustafa to task for not better addressing Mustafa’s followers who had been racist towards Carthen.\n \n\n   \n  A rep for Mustafa told CNN via email on Monday, “We are deeply disappointed by the decision and are happy with the impact the campaign had.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Russell and Carthen for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “Love Island USA” is a spinoff of the popular UK series which seeks to link couples up to find love.

Banks died of complications from renal neoplasm, or kidney cancer, said Montgomery County Coroner Dr. Janine Darby.\n \n\n   \n  Banks had been in prison since 1982 after shooting 14 people, and killing 13, including his own children, during a rampage in Wilkes-Barre. At time, it was considered one of the worst mass murders in American history. He was convicted of 12 counts of first-degree murder and one count of third-degree murder.\n \n\n   \n  Banks had been drinking at a party late at night before using an AR-15 rifle to start the rampage at his home.\n \n\n   \n  Five victims were his children, ages 1 to 6. Four more were the mothers of his children. Other victims were bystanders, including an 11-year-old child who sometimes stayed with his family, a 7-year-old child and a teenager who saw Banks leaving his home armed with the rifle and recognized him.\n \n\n   \n  Banks killed three women and five children at his home, authorities say. Then, dressed in green army fatigues with an ammunition bandolier around his chest and shoulders, Banks left, when he saw four teenagers walking to their car from a nearby friend’s house. He shot one fatally, and another, who survived, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  He stole a car and went to the Heather Highlands Trailer Park where police found the bodies of Banks’ son and the child’s mother, as well as her mother and her nephew.\n \n\n   \n  From there, Banks went to his mother’s house, who told police that Banks told her, “I killed them. I killed them all,” court records say.\n \n\n   \n  Banks eventually surrendered after a four-hour standoff at a friend’s house after police tried to convince him that his victims had survived.\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, state courts prevented his execution, saying he wasn’t mentally competent. That left Banks with a sentence of life imprisonment.\n \n\n   \n  The teenager who survived being shot by Banks, Jim Olson, later expressed frustration in 2012 that Banks hadn’t been executed, saying, “What is the sense of having a death penalty if you don’t use it or enforce it?″\n \n\n   \n  Defense lawyers had argued that Banks was insane when he went on the shooting spree.\n \n\n   \n  After his arrest, Banks, who is biracial, claimed he had killed his children to save them from the pain of growing up in a racist society. During his trial, he overruled his lawyer on strategic decisions, and argued instead that prosecutors, the judge and the mayor of Wilkes-Barre were conspiring against him.\n \n\n   \n  Banks also showed the jury gory pictures of his victims, even after his lawyer had successfully gotten the photos barred on the grounds that they were gruesome and prejudicial.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:38:00-05:00","title":"Defense expert testifies ex-assistant principal met standards in teacher shooting case","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a $40 million civil lawsuit filed by former teacher Abby Zwerner, who was shot by a 6-year-old student with a history of disciplinary problems at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, defense expert Dr. Amy Klinger testified that assistant principal Ebony Parker did not breach professional standards or act with indifference. The expert emphasized that school safety is a shared responsibility among staff and that no single individual can be solely held accountable for unforeseeable events. The lawsuit centers on whether Parker ignored warnings about a student’s possession of a firearm, though experts argue such an event was exceptionally rare and difficult to predict.

Dr. Amy Klinger, an expert in education administration and school safety, said it would have been difficult for anyone to foresee the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for the teacher, Abby Zwerner, rested their case last week, and the defense rested Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The  civil trial  could set a precedent for holding school officials accountable for gun violence on campus and comes ahead of Parker’s criminal trial next month on eight counts of felony child neglect.\n \n\n   \n    School safety is a shared responsibility\n \n\n   \n  Klinger testified the assistant principal’s role is collaborative and school safety is a shared responsibility among all staff, not just one individual. “No one is the sole person responsible for school safety,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  She explained that assessing threats requires gathering credible information from those closest to the situation and that not every concern warrants an immediate or aggressive response.\n \n\n   \n  Parker did not breach professional standards or act with indifference, Klinger said, and it would have been difficult for anyone to foresee the incident, especially given the rarity of a 6-year-old bringing a weapon to school.\n \n\n   \n  Klinger also said crisis plans provide guidance but require professional judgment and flexibility.\n \n\n   \n  During cross-examination, Zwerner’s attorney, Kevin Biniazan, questioned whether Parker should have taken more proactive steps after being told a specific student was reported to have a gun, rather than waiting for more information.\n \n\n   \n  He highlighted Parker did not attempt to identify or speak directly with the students who reported the gun and pressed Klinger on whether this was sufficient effort to get “good information.”\n \n\n   \n  Biniazan emphasized Parker was aware of the possibility of a firearm on campus for about an hour and questioned whether her actions in that time were adequate.\n \n\n   \n  He asked Klinger to rate the likelihood of a gun being on campus at various points in the day, suggesting the risk increased as more information was received, and challenged whether Parker’s response — such as not searching the student or calling a lockdown — was an “underreaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, Dr. Leigh Hagan, a board-certified forensic and clinical psychologist also testifying for the defense, said he reviewed extensive records to assess whether proper forensic standards were followed in forming mental health opinions for the court, though he did not personally evaluate Zwerner or offer opinions on her diagnosis or liability.\n \n\n   \n  He testified a mental health expert’s opinion is enhanced when they look at all of the information.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a responsibility … that you have the full movie of the person’s life, rather than a snapshot,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Parker, who resigned two weeks after the shooting, argues she is not responsible for the student harming his teacher and had no legal duty to intervene. Damages are not warranted, Parker argues, because Zwerner has moved on with her life.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s pain and suffering have been the focus of the trial so far, and Parker’s defense team this week is expected to continue to press Zwerner on whether there was more she could have done between learning of the possible gun threat and when she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s lawsuit alleges Parker ignored “warnings from teachers and staff that students had seen the firearm” and the student had “removed an object that was likely a firearm from his backpack before it was searched.”\n \n\n   \n  Poor decisions led to the “avoidable” shooting, a grand jury report found last April.\n \n\n   \n    Teacher said she thought she was going to die\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner on Thursday testified she thought her wounds were dire.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought I was dying. I thought I had died,” the former first-grade teacher said as she recounted being shot in the hand and chest while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, a psychiatrist testified, and her hand will never be normal, even after six surgeries, an orthopedic surgeon said.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner also has changed since the  shooting  more than two years ago, her twin sister said.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s just not the person that she was,” Hannah Zwerner testified last week.\n \n\n   \n    Parker also faces criminal charges\n \n\n   \n  As school shootings  continue to plague  US campuses, this civil trial could serve as a roadmap for the upcoming criminal case against Parker, which itself could set a broader precedent.\n \n\n   \n  Attempts to hold school officials criminally accountable for school shootings are rare, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  It is also rare for civil cases to precede criminal ones, but it could be strategic in the case of Parker, who faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect in her trial next month, legal experts say.\n \n\n   \n  “I suspect that defense would want the civil trial to go forward first, because they’re not going to be able to avoid it, and it gives them a lot of information about what would come in at the criminal trial,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  Already, the mother of the child who shot Zwerner has been  sentenced to two years  in prison for child neglect, the school board voted out the superintendent and the principal was reassigned to another school.\n \n\n   \n  The civil trial resumes Wednesday, after Election Day Tuesday.   \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-nigeria-military-action-threat","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:21:00-05:00","title":"Trump Threatens U.S. Military Action in Nigeria Over Christian Persecution","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, after viewing a Fox News segment on Christian persecution in Nigeria, became immediately alarmed and took decisive action by declaring Nigeria a 'Country of Particular Concern' under the International Religious Freedom Act.

Within an hour, he was laser-focused on Christians’ treatment in Nigeria \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, Kevin Liptak, Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:21 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump was heading to Florida on Friday, watching Fox News, when he saw the network run a story on how Christians were being targeted by Islamic groups in Nigeria, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The president was “immediately” angered by it, one of the sources said, and asked to get further read in on the issue. Shortly after Air Force One touched down in West Palm Beach, he began posting on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria. Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter,” he posted, adding that he is making Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN the president has “been tracking this issue previously and had already begun thinking about Truthing it out.”\n \n\n   \n  From there, the plight of Christians in Nigeria became a focal point of Trump’s  throughout the weekend , leading him to call directly on his secretary of defense to “prepare for possible action” and warn the US would enter Nigeria “guns-a-blazing” to protect the Christian population of Africa’s most populous country.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources familiar with Trump’s thinking on the issue told CNN that the president’s threats toward the country are meant to “see how Nigeria responds.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an ‘Art of the Deal’”-type strategy, the source said. And a key part of it has already been met with the intended effect: The actions by Islamist groups are gaining attention thanks to his posts, they argued.\n \n\n   \n  “At President Trump’s direction, the Department of War is planning options for possible action to stop the killing of Christians in Nigeria,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CNN. “Any announcements will come from the President directly.”\n \n\n   \n  The plight of Nigeria’s Christians has been an animating subject for American conservatives for years, with some of Trump’s top allies, including Sen. Ted Cruz, in recent months calling for US intervention after claiming Nigeria’s government wasn’t doing enough to prevent attacks on Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria has denied the accusations, and both Christians and Muslims have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists in the country.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s directive to the Pentagon to “prepare for possible action” in Nigeria — including, in his telling, potential US boots on the ground — caught many by surprise, including in the military.\n \n\n   \n  Personnel within US Africa Command were abruptly recalled to headquarters over the weekend following Trump’s post on Saturday vowing potential military action in Nigeria, two sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The post left many wondering what the president wanted the military to do, the sources said. A small group of personnel with AFRICOM, which is based in Germany, were quickly recalled to discuss potential courses of action.\n \n\n   \n  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Saturday that the Pentagon was “preparing for action,” and one of the sources said there was a request from the Pentagon to build out various contingency plans.\n \n\n   \n  It remained unclear what the plans entail, though creating contingency plans for a range of scenarios to provide to the president and secretary of defense is one of the primary functions of the military.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump was elected in a landslide victory to accomplish his peace through strength agenda. The Department of War stands ready to execute the Commander in Chief’s direction,” chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The snap-to reaction on Saturday was indicative of a broader frustration with the way potential policy decisions are relayed over social media, one of the sources familiar said, with little planning done ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, declined to rule out sending American troops to Nigeria to protect Christians there.\n \n\n   \n  “Could be,” Trump said when asked about the prospect of US troops or airstrikes. “I envisage a lot of things. They’re killing a record number of Christians in Nigeria,” the president told reporters, saying other countries in Africa were doing similar.\n \n\n   \n    The reality on the ground\n \n\n   \n  While Trump claimed a “mass slaughter” of Christians was underway in Nigeria, there exists a  more nuanced reality  on the ground. Both Christians and Muslims — the two main religious groups in the country of more than 230 million people — have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists, experts and analysts say.\n \n\n   \n  The West African nation has grappled for years with deep-rooted security problems that are driven by various factors, including religiously motivated attacks. Observers say other violent conflicts arise from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to natural resources.\n \n\n   \n  Massad Boulos, Trump’s adviser on Arab and African affairs, told  Nigerian media  last month that “People of all religions and of all tribes are dying, and it is very unfortunate, and we even know that Boko Haram and ISIS are killing more Muslims than more Christians.”\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government rejects claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence, saying it was bewildered by Trump’s suggestion of a potential military intervention.\n \n\n   \n  “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Within US conservative circles, however, the situation in Nigeria has caused growing alarm. Trump himself raised the issue during a first-term meeting with then-President  Muhammadu Buhari  at the White House in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply concerned by religious violence in Nigeria, including the burning of churches and the killing and persecution of Christians. It’s a horrible story,” Trump said during a joint news conference afterward.\n \n\n   \n  Buhari said he had explained to Trump the security situation in Nigeria was more complicated than mere religious persecution, saying groups sometimes used religious violence as they pursued economic interests.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, Trump designated Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” two years later, citing “severe violations of religious freedom.” The Biden administration reversed the decision.\n \n\n   \n    Renewed effort by conservatives\n \n\n   \n  With Trump’s return to office came a renewed effort by American conservatives to apply pressure on the Nigerian government to stem violence against Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who has earned overwhelming support from evangelical Christians during his campaigns for president, vowed during last year’s election to combat anti-Christian bias. And administration officials have stated previously that protecting Christians is a key tenet of Trump’s foreign policy.\n \n\n   \n  Paula White-Cain, the senior adviser to the White House faith office and Trump’s longtime spiritual adviser, has previously traveled to Nigeria to minister. She thanked Trump on social media this weekend for his “strong stand on Christian persecution in Nigeria.”\n \n\n   \n  Cruz, an evangelical Christian from Texas, is one of the GOP lawmakers who has been working to get his fellow Christians and Congress to designate Nigeria as a violator of religious freedoms.\n \n\n   \n  Cruz, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a bill in September to sanction Nigerian officials whom he accused of “ignoring and even facilitating the mass murder of Christians.” The measure would also require the State Department to redesignate Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” — something the president noted in his first post on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the issue was amplified on “Real Time with Bill Maher” on HBO. Maher said Islamic militants in Nigeria were “attempting to wipe out the Christian population of an entire country.” HBO is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.\n \n\n   \n  None of those calls seemed to go as far as Trump did, however, in threatening US military action on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  How such an intervention is carried out remains to be seen. Last year, the US  completed a withdrawal  of some 1,000 US troops from Niger, which neighbors Nigeria, ending a longtime presence in the nation.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Nimi Princewill contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/china/china-xi-laughing-images-apec-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:37:00-05:00","title":"The White House has shared images of Xi Jinping that most Chinese don’t see at home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House released images of Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea, capturing rare informal moments — including a candid interaction with US President Donald Trump and a humorous exchange with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.

3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Xi Jinping is not known for his easy smiles. China’s most powerful Communist leader in decades has built a reputation reinforced by state media during his 12-year rule as a serious and steady hand.\n \n\n   \n  But images released by the White House show a different side of Xi – and one not apparent in images published at home.\n \n\n   \n   Xi attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) summit in South Korea, where he met US President Donald Trump for a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base in Busan.\n \n\n   \n  All eyes were on how the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies would sort out their differences on a range of topics from soybeans and fentanyl to rare earth minerals and high-end computer chips.\n \n\n   \n  But aside from the hard-hitting diplomacy, photographs released by the White House captured a rare candid moment between the two leaders.\n \n\n   \n  In a room filled with suited diplomats, Trump was seen in one image with his arm stretched across the negotiation table to show Xi a piece of paper. Whatever was written or printed on the paper remains unknown.\n \n\n   \n  In another image, the Chinese leader appears to grin with his eyes shut, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi laughing by his side. It’s unclear if the images were arranged in chronological order.\n \n\n   \n  Two days later, Xi was caught on camera cracking a joke when he exchanged gifts with South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung, according to a Reuters video.\n \n\n   \n  Lee first presented Xi with a wooden board for the chess game Go. Then, the Chinese leader gave Lee and his wife two  China -made Xiaomi phones, which an official said came with displays made in South Korea, home to electronic giants Samsung and LG.\n \n\n   \n  Lee then jokingly asked: “How is the communication security?” drawing laughter from the room.\n \n\n   \n  Xi, who was also laughing at this point, replied: “You can check if there’s a backdoor.”\n \n\n   \n  A backdoor risk refers to a hidden method of accessing a users’ device without them knowing. The issue has prompted a raft of allegations between China and other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has recently expressed concerns over a US proposal to have advanced chips sold abroad fitted with tracking, a suggestion that prompted  US chipmaker Nvidia to say its chips had no “backdoors.”  Meanwhile, numerous Western countries have raised cybersecurity concerns regarding certain China-made devices.\n \n\n   \n  The two off-the-cuff moments from Xi contrast with his carefully crafted image at home, where he was recently shown  presiding over a military parade in a Mao suit , an outfit associated with Mao Zedong, Communist China’s founding father.\n \n\n   \n  Before his meeting with Trump, he chaired a party  plenum , delivering speeches in a stoic demonstration of his tight control over China’s political apparatus.\n \n\n   \n  Not all Chinese leaders projected such a tightly constructed image.\n \n\n   \n  Xi’s predecessor Jiang Zemin, who served as president between 1993 and 2003, was known for his flamboyant personality, cosmopolitan flair and willingness to show off his language skills and interact with journalists.\n \n\n   \n  However, Xi has charted a different course. Along with curbing freedom of expression in China, he has maintained strict control of his image and the flow of information. Elite politics has become so opaque under his rule that pundits look for any clue for China’s direction – from parsing Xi’s words for their real meaning to assessing the  color of his hair. \n \n\n   \n  Xi’s more relaxed international appearances in South Korea barely made it to China’s tightly controlled internet. Censors often remove any coverage of Xi that deviates from the official narrative in the country, where most Western news websites and social media platforms are banned.\n \n\n   \n  Footage and images showing Xi’s light-hearted exchanges with his US and South Korean counterparts were nowhere to be found on two of the country’s most popular social media platforms: Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, and Xiaohongshu.\n \n\n   \n  A few posts by Chinese-language news outlets based outside of China that reported Xi’s gift exchange with South Korea’s Lee were available on X-like platform Weibo.\n \n\n   \n  The posts only displayed a few users’ comments despite hundreds of messages. Among the reactions that survived, one user posted a thumbs up emoji and another left a smiling face.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/kimberly-clark-kenvue-acquisition","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:09:00-05:00","title":"Tylenol’s Parent Company to Merge with Huggies Maker in $48.7 Billion Deal","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kimberly-Clark is acquiring Kenvue in a $48.7 billion deal to form a massive consumer products conglomerate with 10 billion-dollar brands, including Tylenol, Huggies, Kleenex, and Depends.

parent company will combine with the maker of Huggies in a $48.7 billion mega-deal \n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:09 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Huggies maker Kimberly-Clark announced Monday it will buy Tylenol’s parent company Kenvue in a nearly $50 billion deal, creating a massive consumer products conglomerate.\n \n\n   \n  The merger is the latest in a recent dealmaking explosion, signaling the Trump administration’s openness toward corporate acquisitions. But it also represents a gamble that one of Kenvue’s signature products will be able to withstand increased scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  The acquisition comes a few weeks after President Donald Trump made  unfounded claims  linking autism to Tylenol use during pregnancy, sending Kenvue’s stock sharply lower. The company has  staunchly pushed back  against his administration’s accusations.\n \n\n   \n  The companies said that the combined business will bring together 10 billion-dollar brands and will drive annual revenue of $32 billion. The new company will make products that “touch nearly half the global population through every stage of life,” including Johnson’s baby products, Clean & Clear skin care, Kleenex, Listerine mouthwash, and Depends adult diapers, the companies said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n   Kenvue was spun off in 2022  from Johnson & Johnson, with J&J keeping its recognizable name for its larger pharmaceutical business unit and offloading its consumer brands. It was widely expected to be an acquisition target.\n \n\n   \n  The transaction is scheduled to close in the second half of next year. Following the closing, Kimberly-Clark shareholders will own about 54% of the newly combined company, with Kenvue shareholders owning the rest.\n \n\n   \n    A risky bet\n \n\n   \n  The deal comes with some considerable risks.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Kenvue reported an overall sales decline of 4.4%, as well as its its self care unit, which includes Tylenol, falling 5.3% for the quarter ending on September 28.\n \n\n   \n  The company explained that the sales declines were the result of “trade inventory reductions in certain customers,” likely that from cash-strapped customers trading down to cheaper, private labels that offer similar quality — perhaps a warning a sign to the new company that’s betting on a lineup of name-brand companies.\n \n\n   \n  And Kenvue faces potentially intense legal scrutiny over the Trump administration’s claims. Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton  filed a lawsuit against Kenvue , claiming that the company “deceptively” marketed Tylenol to pregnant women and that the medication is tied to an increased risk of autism. Kenvue said it will “vigorously defend” against the claims.\n \n\n   \n  Kimberly-Clark CEO Mike Hsu addressed the Tylenol issue on a call with analysts Monday, saying its “board carefully considered all the risks and all the opportunities” and had multiple meetings with “medical, regulatory and legal experts” and decided that the deal is a “generational value creation opportunity for both companies.”\n \n\n   \n  “We stand firmly behind the science and the safety of our products,” added Kenvue CEO Kirk Perry. “These things have been studied for decades, and we continue to stand by that science as the medical community does as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The cash-and-stock deal has Kimberly-Clark ( KMB ) paying $21.01 for each Kenvue ( KVUE ) share, a hefty premium over the $14.37 of its Friday closing price.\n \n\n   \n  But the premium is only slightly higher than the $17 a share Kenvue’s stock was trading for just before Trump held his “don’t take Tylenol” news conference on September 22. And it’s only a hair above the $20 stock price right before the first news reports suggested that the Trump administration may make a link between Tylenol and autism.\n \n\n   \n  Kenvue’s stock soared more than 16% Monday. Kimberly-Clark’s stock fell nearly 13%.\n \n\n   \n    An M&A explosion\n \n\n   \n  The deal comes as the deregulatory environment ushered in with the Trump administration has led to a rush of mergers and acquisitions.\n \n\n   \n  The Kenvue deal is the third-largest acquisition this year, according to mergers-and-acquisitions data provider Dealogic. The $72 billion deal between railroad companies  Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern  ranks first and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund  purchase  of video games maker Electronics Arts for $55 million places second.\n \n\n   \n  After deals cooled off considerably in the post-pandemic era, M&A appears to be back in a big way this year. So far, 2025 has produced $1.9 trillion in deals in the United States, up the highest since 2021, according to Dealogic. Excluding the pandemic-fueled M&A boom, 2025’s deals hold the highest collective value since 2015 and are on pace to surpass it.\n \n\n   \n  The Kimberly-Clark acquisition of Kenvue would be the fourth-largest consumer products deal of all time, behind only Altria’s $111 billion spin-off of Philip Morris International in 2008, British American Tobacco’s 2015 purchase of Reynolds American for $64 billion, and P&G’s 2005 Gillette acquisition for $61 billion.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/entertainment/diane-ladd-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:43:00Z","title":"Diane Ladd, 3-time Oscar nominee, dies at 89","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Diane Ladd, a three-time Academy Award nominee known for her compelling performances in films like 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore' and 'Wild at Heart,' has died at the age of 89.

   \nUpdated: \n        5:43 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   Diane Ladd , the three-time Academy Award nominee whose roles ranged from the brash waitress in “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” to the protective mother in “Wild at Heart,” has died at 89.\n \n\n   \n  Ladd’s death was announced Monday by daughter  Laura Dern , who issued a statement saying her mother and occasional co-star had died at her home in Ojai, California, with Dern at her side. Dern, who called Ladd her “amazing hero” and “profound gift of a mother,” did not immediately cite a cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  “She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,” Dern wrote. “We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.”\n \n\n   \n  A gifted comic and dramatic performer, Ladd had a long career in television and on stage before breaking through as a film performer in Martin Scorsese’s 1974 release “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” She earned an Oscar nomination for supporting actress for her turn as the acerbic, straight-talking Flo, and went on to appears in dozens of movies over the following decades. Her many credits included “Chinatown,” “Primary Colors” and two other movies for which she received best supporting nods, “Wild at Heart” and “Rambling Rose,” both of which co-starred her daughter. She also continued to work in television, with appearances in “ER,” “Touched by Angel” and “Alice,” the spinoff from “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” among others.\n \n\n   \n  Through marriage and blood relations, Ladd was tied to the arts. Tennessee Williams was a second cousin and first husband Bruce Dern, Laura’s father, was himself an Academy Award nominee. Ladd and Laura Dern achieved the rare feat of mother-and-daughter nominees for their work in “Rambling Rose” and they also were memorably paired in “Wild at Heart,” a personal favorite of Ladd’s and winner of the Palme d’Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In the dark, farcical  David Lynch  noir, her character, Marietta, is willing to try anything – including murder – to keep her daughter (Laura Dern) away from her ex-con lover, played by Nicolas Cage. Ladd would be called upon by the director for some Lynchian touches, and countered with some of her own.\n \n\n   \n  “One day, the script said that Marietta gets in bed, curls up with her baby dog, and is sucking her thumb,” she told Vulture in 2024. “I looked at him and said, ‘David, I don’t want to do that.’ He said, ’What do you want to do?’ I said, ‘I want to put on a long satin nightgown, I want to stand in the middle of the bed holding a martini and drinking it, and I want to sway to the old music within my head.’ He said ‘OK.’ I did it, and he loved it.”\n \n\n   \n  A native of Laurel, Mississippi, Ladd was born Rose Diane Ladner and was apparently destined to stand out. In her 2006 memoir, “Spiraling Through the School of Life,” she remembered being told by her great-grandmother that she would one day in “front of a screen” and would “command” her own audiences.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:24 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Food stamp recipients will  only get half  of their typical benefits in November, and for many, that assistance will likely be delayed.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture said in a court filing Monday that it will only tap into the program’s contingency fund, which doesn’t have enough money to cover enrollees’ full allotments during the government shutdown. The agency said it will not use an additional pot of money to make up the difference in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for  food stamps .\n \n\n   \n  The move came after a federal judge in Rhode Island  ordered  the USDA last week to either start providing full November benefits to recipients or partial benefits if the agency opts to only draw on SNAP’s contingency fund. A second federal judge also ruled last week that the agency is required at least to use the contingency fund.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA’s unprecedented decision to halt food stamps benefits in November prompted  a coalition of Democratic-led states  and a group of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to sue last week.\n \n\n   \n  Both judges said it was up to the agency whether to tap into other money to enable it to provide the full allocation. The agency has opted to transfer $750 million in unused tariff revenue dedicated to child nutrition programs to support the  WIC nutrition assistance program  during the shutdown but said it can’t do the same for SNAP without endangering the free and reduced-price school meals and other programs.\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  The much-needed SNAP assistance won’t come that quickly for many food stamp recipients. Several procedural challenges must be overcome before the benefits can start flowing to the nearly 42 million people who receive food stamps. SNAP provides households with just over $350 a month, on average, as of May, according to the most recent USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of  issuing benefits for November  after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  The delay has been felt immediately. Some 3 million recipients should have received their benefits on November 1, according to an estimate by Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. The number grows to nearly 13.7 million by November 5, with remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not going out on time,” Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, told CNN last week of the November benefits.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, providing partial payments is much more complicated — and time consuming.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA has never had to reduce benefits for all SNAP recipients before, according to a declaration filed Friday by the agency official who oversees the program. Also, state agencies will need to recode their systems to issue the smaller benefit amounts, which could result in errors.\n \n\n   \n  “Given the variation among State systems, some of which are decades old, it is unclear how many States will complete the changes in an automated manner with minimal disruption versus manual overrides or computations that could lead to payment errors and significant delays,” said Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of the USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services,  in a second declaration filed Monday.\n \n\n   \n  For at least some states, the process could take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, Penn said.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA will provide guidance on calculating the partial payments to states on Monday, Penn told the court.\n \n\n   \n  While some states have identified potential ways to issue smaller benefits quickly, the methods must be programmed, tested and verified, which could take time, Plata-Nino noted.\n \n\n   \n  SNAP enrollees who receive partial benefits in November will get retroactive payments to make them whole once the government reopens, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Providing full benefits would have been the fastest way to get assistance to food stamp recipients.\n \n\n   \n  “If the administration complies with the courts’ rulings to release the SNAP contingency funds immediately and supplements those amounts using its legal transfer authority, which the courts also affirmed, then SNAP benefits could begin to be issued with only a short delay,” Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told CNN last week.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated following the Department of Agriculture’s announcement that it would pay partial SNAP benefits for November. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/nebraska-cornhusker-clink-ice-detention-center","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:37:00Z","title":"An undocumented mother says ICE raids and ‘Cornhusker Clink’ are the end of the Nebraska she’s called home for decades","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details how immigration raids and the opening of the 'Cornhusker Clink' ICE detention center in Nebraska are disrupting long-standing, diverse immigrant communities.

of the Nebraska she’s called home for decades \n       \n  By Nayeli Jaramillo-Plata, Amanda Musa, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:37 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Alejandra doesn’t leave her home unless she really needs to. She skips doctor’s appointments and church to remain undetected. And if she is detained by immigration enforcement officials, her 13-year-old son is prepared with a list of people to call and his social security number memorized.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot be separated from my kids,” said the 30-year-old undocumented mother of four children who were born in the United States. “I just can’t risk it.” CNN agreed to only use Alejandra’s first name to protect her identity out of respect for her safety concerns due to her immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  The idea that her family might be ripped apart only crossed her mind recently, she said, when President Donald Trump’s nationwide  immigration crackdown  penetrated the humble, quiet Nebraska community she calls home.\n \n\n   \n  In June, a  meatpacking plant in Omaha  was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in what the agency described as the  largest worksite operation  in the state since the start of the Trump administration. Alejandra says several family friends and church acquaintances were among the dozens of people detained.\n \n\n   \n  As that event continues to generate aftershocks, a new ICE detention center, dubbed the  “Cornhusker Clink,”  is opening in western Nebraska soon and is expected to hold up to 300 adults, a spokesperson for Nebraska’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen told CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The facility will join other new ICE detention centers in Republican-led states, including “ Alligator Alcatraz ” in Florida, “Louisiana Lockup” or  “Camp 57”  in Louisiana, and “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana.\n \n\n   \n  These new ICE facilities “are significantly expanding detention space to house the worst of the worst illegal aliens,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN Wednesday. “We look forward to the opening of this new partnership with Nebraska very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s office has estimated the contract with DHS will bring around $14 million annually to the state. Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for the governor’s office described it as “the latest action undertaken by Gov. Pillen to stand with President Trump and protect Americans from criminal illegal aliens. The facility will not only serve Nebraska, but also other states in the region.”\n \n\n   \n  Sitting hundreds of miles away from the border, the opening of “Cornhusker Clink” may solidify Nebraska’s place in the national immigration debate. Unlike many states at the center of immigration enforcement operations, Nebraska is under full Republican control and its governor hasn’t shied away from the conversation.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen signed a  January executive order  expressing his support for federal immigration policy, ordered Nebraska National Guard deployments to Texas, and facilitated the  troops’ activation  ahead of recent ICE protests in his state. He also touted the alleged  arrest of a MS-13 “kingpin”  in Omaha this summer.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, immigration advocates, some state lawmakers and business leaders said it’s a contrast from the previously welcoming atmosphere they have worked to build in the state, especially to strengthen its economy.\n \n\n   \n    Nebraska’s immigrant workforce under threat\n \n\n   \n  Unlike other states, Nebraska is not often seen as a haven for immigrants, but parts of the state are an enclave for Latinos, who have lived and worked in the Cornhusker state for many years in part due to the meat packing industry, immigration advocates and business leaders in the state say.\n \n\n   \n  Today, much of Nebraska’s Latino population is second, third, or even fourth generation. In rural towns like Schuyler, Lexington and Madison, which some call “Latino Pueblos,” some business owners and community leaders were initially drawn by jobs at meat-packing plants and stayed for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Now, immigration operations are threatening the stability of these small communities and industry operations in Nebraska, said John Hansen, president of the  Nebraska Farmers Union .\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an awful lot of folks that are just afraid to show up to work, afraid to be seen in public,” said Hansen, noting many farms and meatpacking plants are struggling to stay staffed.\n \n\n   \n  Nebraska’s meatpacking industry, which includes major processing facilities for JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield, depends on immigrant labor. Immigrants, many of whom are undocumented, represent about 53% of the state’s workforce, according to the  Migration Policy Institute .\n \n\n   \n  Immigration raids, rising deportation fears and political shifts have created “an atmosphere of fear and intimidation,” among workers, Hansen said, and some union members have privately expressed regret about voting for Trump, who won a majority of the state’s vote in the 2024 election, citing mass deportation and tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The state is experiencing a severe labor shortage, with only 70 available workers for every 100 open jobs as of August, according to data from the  US Chamber of Commerce .\n \n\n   \n  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly claimed  immigrants were taking jobs from Americans.  But in actuality, immigrants were  filling critical labor gaps,  economists say.\n \n\n   \n  While meat packing jobs initially built stable, middle-class lives, Hansen said, injuries like carpal tunnel surged as assembly lines became faster and more repetitive by the 1960s and 1970s, leading to an exodus of American workers. Then, immigrants filled the gap, shaping Nebraska’s farms, factories and towns for decades, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Immigrants, like Alejandra’s family who first migrated from Mexico to Iowa, as well as Latinos born in the US, have spent decades inside those plants, cutting, trimming, packing and processing meat that ends up on dinner tables across America.\n \n\n   \n  Ness Sandoval, a professor at Saint Louis University who studies inequality and Latino and immigrant demography, recalls growing up in Nebraska and his dad’s grueling job at a meatpacking plant.\n \n\n   \n  “He had no time or energy to go to any of my events or sports. He would make an effort when it was something meaningful, but he had to be in bed like at 8 o’clock,” Sandoval said. “It’s a very physical job on the body.”\n \n\n   \n  Injuries were once so routine Sandoval’s father was given an award for going a year without getting hurt. As the years passed, the repetitive work led him to suffer from shoulder injuries, arthritis and later, he retired after breaking his shoulder in a fall, Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n  Although his father took pride in his work, he never wanted his son to follow the same path “because he understood how difficult that job was on the body,” Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n    Remote state prison transformed to hold immigrants\n \n\n   \n  The terracotta-colored building in McCook, Nebraska, soon to be referred as “Cornhusker Clink” was previously a state prison known as the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services’ Work Ethic Camp.\n \n\n   \n  With a focus on reintegrating low-risk offenders back into the community, the camp housed more than 180 inmates who often worked on-site at the facility’s kitchen or warehouse, according to a 2024  report.  Others filled road-crew jobs with the Nebraska Department of Transportation.\n \n\n   \n  The facility, opened since 2001, aimed to ease prison overcrowding “and make prison bed space available for violent offenders.” Decades later, the Nebraska prison system is still struggling to manage its current population, which is exceeding 140% of its design capacity, according to a  2024 report  by the state’s inspector general of the correctional system.\n \n\n   \n  Repurposing the facility in McCook is expected to further destabilize the prison system, said Mindy Chipman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska.\n \n\n   \n  “Transitioning a minimum-security facility that provides reentry services — services the Department of Corrections says are more needed than ever — into an immigration detention center removes support from Nebraskans and confines people, most of whom have no criminal record,” Chipman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Current prisoners will be discharged, placed on parole or transferred to other correctional facilities “by the time the facility is ready to house ICE detainees,” the governor’s office said in a  September news release .\n \n\n   \n  When the converted ICE detention center opens, state officials said, people with minor criminal records and nonviolent felonies will be eligible to be placed there but not those with felony convictions linked to acts of violence.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the governor’s office, the department of corrections and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s motive is not safety, according to Chipman, but rather to signal support for Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. The “Cornhusker Clink” is one of several new detention projects backed by the Trump administration’s $45 billion “ One Big Beautiful Bill ,” which would add 80,000 ICE beds nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the overcrowding, legal advocates in Nebraska said they worry the facility’s remote location could increase the likelihood of detainees experiencing civil rights violations, with many being far from family and attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  McCook is one of several small communities in southwestern Nebraska and sits somewhat close to Interstate 80, a major highway that travels east to Omaha – about four hours away – and west toward Denver – three hours away.\n \n\n   \n  There is no public bus from Omaha, the most populous city in the state, to McCook as well as to North Platte, a rural town about an hour north of it where most of the immigrants detained following the raid at the meatpacking plant in June were taken. All travel must be done by car, which could become tricky during the harsh Nebraska winters.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s easier to get to North Platte because it’s on I-80. McCook, you have to go further, and you are more in the middle of nowhere,” said Lina Traslaviña Stover, executive director of the Omaha-based nonprofit Heartland Workers Group, whose work involves advocating for migrants who are detained at immigration detention facilities in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “Isolation is part of the strategy,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Anne Wruth, an attorney with the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, who traveled west to meet with a detained client in North Platte, called the process a “logistical nightmare.”\n \n\n   \n  For lawmakers and advocates, who said they were surprised when plans for the ICE facility were announced, there are other pressing needs such as property taxes, labor shortage and affordable housing in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This was not something that went through us,” Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature whose district includes part of Omaha, said about state lawmakers and plans for the facility, noting the timeline was “extremely truncated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘And if anything happens, you go’\n \n\n   \n  Alejandra is realizing the state she and her parents have called home and instantly made them feel welcome – where many still say “please” and “thank you” – has started to turn against them, or at least some people.\n \n\n   \n  When the family first arrived in Nebraska, Alejandra excelled in school where she was surrounded by classmates from Thailand, Haiti and El Salvador – a diversity fueled in part by the state’s refugee resettlement program, which welcomes the most refugees per capita compared to other US states despite Nebraska’s relatively small population of just over 2 million people, according to a  data analysis  from the Immigration Research Initiative, a non-profit, non-partisan think tank tracking immigrant data.\n \n\n   \n  “It was awesome. I saw so many different races and nationalities — I wasn’t the only one,” Alejandra said. “Compared to Iowa, I wasn’t highlighted as ‘she is not from here.’”\n \n\n   \n  Her parents, who are also undocumented, own a home and pay taxes. They’ve seen their children and grandchildren grow up and enjoyed taking them to the park or baseball games.\n \n\n   \n  With animosity toward immigrants on the rise in the US and Nebraska, Alejandra says her parents will soon leave the country as they plan to self-deport to Mexico in six months. They are afraid to be detained and worry the conditions at ICE facilities could jeopardize her mother’s fragile health.\n \n\n   \n  “They do not like living in fear,” Alejandra said.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not immune to that fear, and neither are her children. In recent weeks, Alejandra gave her 13-year-old son instructions on what to do if anything were to happen to her as they drove to the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  “’Mom, you stay in the car and I’ll go inside. I’ll get everything that we need. And if anything happens, you go, but you drive away,’” Alejandra recalled her son telling her. “I know who to call.”\n \n\n   \n  As she looks towards the future, Alejandra wonders what kind of future awaits her young sons, especially if the Nebraska she knows continues to transform and align with Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric. Like her parents, Alejandra says she may be forced to leave the state, and everything she knows, in exchange for a stable and happy life.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/france-shein-sex-doll-scandal-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"15:51:00-05:00","title":"Shein Bans Sale of Sex Dolls Following French Threat to Block Platform","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shein, a Chinese e-commerce platform, announced a complete ban on sex dolls after France’s anti-fraud office (DGCCRF) accused the company of selling products with childlike appearances that could be considered pedopornographic.

   \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Chinese e-commerce platform  Shein  announced on Monday a “complete ban” on sex dolls on its site   after France threatened to cut off its access to the French market.\n \n\n   \n  Over the weekend, France’s anti-fraud office, the DGCCRF, accused the  fast-fashion platform  of selling sex dolls “with a childlike appearance,” saying in a statement: “Their description and their categorization on the site make it difficult to doubt the pedopornographic nature of the content.”\n \n\n   \n  The dolls were available for purchase on the French version of Shein’s platform until 4 a.m. local time Monday, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, which prompted a stark warning from French Finance Minister Roland Lescure.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to be very clear: If these behaviors are repeated, we will be entitled to… ban access to the French market for the Shein platform,” he told BFMTV Monday. “These horrible objects are illegal,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the controversy, Shein said it had implemented a “complete ban on all sex-doll products, removing every related listing and visual from the platform,” telling CNN in a Monday statement that its “adult products” category had been temporarily delisted while a comprehensive review was carried out.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Tang, Shein’s executive chairman, said the “fight against child exploitation is non-negotiable for SHEIN.”\n \n\n   \n  The company said in an earlier statement that the relevant products were removed from sale as soon as the company became aware of “these serious issues.”\n \n\n   \n  “We take this matter extremely seriously,” that statement said. “Such content is completely unacceptable and goes against everything we stand for. We are taking immediate corrective actions and reinforcing our internal controls to prevent this from happening again.”\n \n\n   \n  The timing of this scandal couldn’t be worse for the Chinese platform. On Wednesday, Shein is due to open its very first brick-and-mortar store in Paris – the first in the world – which will be followed by more shops across France.\n \n\n   \n  French authorities have passed the case onto French prosecutors, as well as the French telecom regulator, according to Lescure.\n \n\n   \n  In its statement, the anti-fraud office said the sharing of pedophilic material on “electronic networks” is punishable with up to seven years’ imprisonment and a €100,000 ($115,000) fine under French law. It also said the sale of the dolls shows Shein does not have sufficient safeguards in place against minors accessing pornographic material on its website, also a crime under French law.\n \n\n   \n  France’s High Commissioner for Childhood, Sarah El-Haïry, told BFMTV Monday that she wanted to identify both the sellers and buyers of these dolls.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, online retail giant  Amazon  was embroiled in a similar affair, after third-party sellers used the platform to hawk child sex dolls.

Sean Walker, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:59 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The air smells of damp earth and drying mud. Smoke from debris fires mixes with a faint tang of fuel from the few generators that still have gas. Every sound carries: the strike of hammers and the scrape of shovels as Jamaicans try to dig out and rebuild after Hurricane Melissa slammed into the island.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached the  hardest-hit western parishes  and the towns of Belmont, Black River and White House, where destruction is uneven but staggering. Some neighborhoods are gutted, others look untouched.\n \n\n   \n  Roofs were peeled away, and windows blown out in the Category 5 hurricane, leaving no protection from the rain and up to 16 feet of seawater driven onto land in the storm surge.\n \n\n   \n  Possessions have been dragged out to dry as much as they can in the hot and humid conditions. And everywhere, survivors try to make sense of it all.\n \n\n   \n  Three-year-old Alessandra points to what used to be her bed. “It’s all mash up,” she says with a small smile.\n \n\n   \n  Her mother, Alandrea Brown, 26, walks around what remains of their home. “We are very distressed,” she says. “We really need some help because you have persons who are very homeless, and we don’t really have any food supplies.”\n \n\n   \n  Much of that help has yet to come.\n \n\n   \n  As we prepare to leave, a man points to another house. Inside, he says, a neighbor’s body still lies uncollected. Through a broken window, a sheet covers the remains of a man, one of his hands resting outside the cover.\n \n\n   \n  There was no way for neighbors to call for help. No phone signal. No road access. CNN relayed the information to authorities once the team was able. It is a haunting reminder of how cut off this region remains.\n \n\n   \n  In Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, and across the east, life goes on. Volunteers and supplies are pushing west to help people and start to heal the vital economic lifelines of tourism and agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaican officials raised the nation’s death toll to 32 on Monday. It will almost certainly rise as emergency teams reach more devastated areas.\n \n\n   \n  But for now, when night falls, the west of the island goes quiet. No power. No water. Only the chirp of insects and the distant hum of a generator. Mattresses are dragged back inside, still damp but something to sleep on. The air smells of wet wood and salt.\n \n\n   \n  By morning, long lines form for fuel, food, and clean water. Those without running taps turn to the river or rainwater pipes. Families wash clothes, fill buckets, and share stories about what they lost.\n \n\n   \n  “I guess it doesn’t really hit us yet,” says Simone Gardon, 40, when asked about the impact of the storm —  the strongest ever  to hit Jamaica. Her voice trails off as she looks to when things may become clearer. “After two weeks, when it’s all settled down and the hunger sets in…”\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors have become their own first responders. They move fallen trees, lift tangled wires, and hammer tin over broken beams. They rebuild because they must, knowing help is on the way, but not soon enough.\n \n\n   \n    Treating patients in a ruined hospital\n \n\n   \n  In Black River, the region’s main hospital is barely standing. Rain leaks through the roof. Corridors sit in darkness.\n \n\n   \n  Senior Medical Officer Dr. Sheriff Imoru tells CNN his home was destroyed too, compounding his heartache. “When I see this place, my hospital, it’s very difficult even to come through the gates in the mornings. But I have to.”\n \n\n   \n  He and his staff, many of whom also lost their homes, keep showing up. The emergency room still operates without power or running water.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the few dry rooms, Shaniel Tomlin holds her one-year-old son, Jahmar, who hit his head after the storm. He’s covered in bandages, like a war veteran. She has a prescription in her hand, but nowhere to fill it.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything’s gone,” she says softly, her eyes welling as the weight of what’s ahead begins to sink in.\n \n\n   \n  Across this centuries-old coastal town, buildings like the courthouse, library, government offices and the elementary school are destroyed.\n \n\n   \n  From Kingston, trucks loaded with food, fuel and aid wind their way west, at times sitting for hours in traffic as roads are slowly cleared.\n \n\n   \n  “We are resilient,” says Lisa Hanna, a former member of parliament. “There’s almost an empathetic solidarity across the island and across the world to get things here. We’re not going to make our people starve.”\n \n\n   \n  Groups including World Central Kitchen, Operation Blessing, and Samaritan’s Purse are already on the ground, setting up kitchens and delivering water. Relief teams expect to stay for months. And even that may not be enough.\n \n\n   \n  The tourism industry, the backbone of Jamaica’s economy, is watching closely. Officials stress that much of the island remains open, especially the north and east, as peak season begins next month. But in the west, where Melissa hit hardest, rebuilding will take time.\n \n\n   \n  When a radio signal returns, so does the sound of resilience. Music drifts through the salt air as roadside vendors fry fish on bare concrete slabs, their foodstands long washed away. The scent of smoke and the rhythm of song fill what silence the storm left behind.\n \n\n   \n  “We are Jamaicans,” one man shouts. “We are the strongest people in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  The winds are gone, the water has receded, but the scars will last. In western Jamaica, the fight is just beginning.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/early-voting-elections-nyc-virginia-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:11:00-05:00","title":"What early voting data says about NYC, Virginia and New Jersey elections heading into Tuesday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Early voting data from New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City suggests that Democratic candidates are in stronger positions than Kamala Harris was at the same point in 2024.

Tuesday \n       \n  By Edward Wu, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:11 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Early voting data suggests that the  Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia  are heading into Election Day in a slightly stronger position than Kamala Harris was at the same time last year.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City,  Andrew Cuomo  may have emerged in a stronger position than in the primary. But a key part of  Zohran Mamdani’s base  also surged through early in-person voting.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s experts analyzed the pre-election voting data in all three locations, comparing to 2024 in New Jersey and Virginia to better reflect the changes in early voting patterns over the last four years.\n \n\n   \n  Although early voting analysis can provide hints about which candidates may be well positioned heading into November 4, it is impossible to know who pre-election voters supported or how candidates will do on Election Day, when many of the ballots will be cast.\n \n\n   \n  Note: In all three locations, early in-person voting has concluded, while mail ballots can continue to arrive over the coming days.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey: A Democratic turnout advantage\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Democrats turned out at a higher rate than Republican voters relative to 2024 in both mail and early in-person voting, putting the Democratic candidate for governor, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in a stronger position than Harris was last year before Election Day. Harris eventually won the state by about 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  Through the end of Thursday, registered Democrats led registered Republicans in mail ballot returns by over 41 points, a couple of points better than the 39-point gap at the equivalent point last year. But unlike last year, Democrats also held a nearly 2-point lead in in-person early voting. Last year at this time, Democrats trailed in in-person voting by 2 points.\n \n\n   \n  As of the end of early in-person voting on November 2, Democrats represented a larger share of the total pre-election electorate than they did at this point last year. Registered Democrats led registered Republicans in total pre-election votes by 22 points, compared to a 16-point lead at this time last year, according to data from Catalist.\n \n\n   \n    New York City: Older voters turned out more; younger voters caught up\n \n\n   \n  Among registered Democrats, a group that will make up the lion’s share of New York City mayoral voters, older voters turned out more at the start of in-person early voting than in the primary, when strong backing from younger voters helped propel Mamdani to a surprise victory. But the electorate got younger through the early voting period and is considerably younger than in past mayoral elections.\n \n\n   \n  The electorate is considerably younger than in past mayoral elections, and a CNN analysis of early voting data from the New York City Board of Elections found that daily turnout among Democrats got younger over the course of early in-person voting: While older voters outnumbered younger ones by about 50 percentage points on the first day of early voting, that dropped below 20 points on the final day.\n \n\n   \n  Now, about 49% of registered Democratic early in-person voters (51% of all early in-person voters) are ages 50 and up, while 17% of Democratic voters are ages 18 to 29 (16% of voters overall).\n \n\n   \n  That’s roughly the same as the total Democratic primary electorate, when about 48% were 50 or older and about 18% of voters were 18 to 29, according to data from L2.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown that younger voters overwhelmingly favor Mamdani, while Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has a smaller lead among older voters.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s turnout is also far younger than the city’s last mayoral election in 2021, when just 9% of voters were ages 18 to 29 and 62% were ages 50 and older.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of Democratic votes was more favorable to Cuomo than it was in the June primary, with turnout strongest in precincts where Cuomo did best and relatively weaker in strong Mamdani areas. The most Cuomo-friendly precincts cast 177% of their primary early in-person totals while the most Mamdani-friendly precincts cast 132% of their early voting totals.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if the precinct-level Mamdani vs. Cuomo vote from the primary stayed the same, the changes so far in geographic distribution alone wouldn’t be nearly enough for Cuomo to overtake Mamdani among Democratic early voters.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia: Spanberger appears in slightly stronger position\n \n\n   \n  While voters don’t register by party in Virginia, the geographic breakdown of votes cast so far suggests Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is in slightly stronger position heading into Election Day than Harris was at the same point in last year’s election, when she won Virginia by less than 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of early in-person votes and mail ballots is similar to what they were at this point last year. But mail ballots, in which Democrats typically perform better, make up a slightly larger share of the pre-election vote this year (22%) than they did at this point last year (19%), resulting in a geographic breakdown of the combined pre-election vote that is more Democratic-leaning relative to the same point in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  During early in-person voting, counties where Trump won last year averaged 62% of their in-person votes cast last year, while Harris-won counties finished at 60%. The worst performing counties were places where Trump won more than 75% of the vote – they finished at just 55% of the in-person votes they cast last year.\n \n\n   \n  Harris-won counties finished in-person early voting strongly, narrowing the gap from 10 points to 2 points now, largely coinciding with an increased number of voting locations opening in large Democratic-leaning counties such as  Arlington  and  Fairfax .\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/sport/why-there-are-so-many-long-field-goals-in-the-nfl-this-season-including-a-new-record-setter","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":""},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/americas/day-of-the-dead-mexico-traditions-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00Z","title":"The Day of the Dead’s ancient traditions live on in this small Mexican town","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the deep cultural significance of the Day of the Dead in San Andrés Mixquic, Mexico, focusing on a family’s heartfelt tradition of honoring deceased loved ones through personalized rituals.

Mixquic, a little town just outside Mexico City, is lined with marigolds. Ángel Jiménez del Aguila, who died in 2010, need only follow the trail of flower petals, the scent of smoldering copal and the rhythm of  danzón  music to find his old front door, where his wife and children wait for him.\n \n\n   \n  According to Mexican tradition, every year, the door between the world of the living and the dead swings open on the first two days of November. This is Día de los Muertos,  the Day of the Dead .\n \n\n   \n  Often mischaracterized as a Mexican version of Halloween, the Day of the Dead is many things depending on whom you ask.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a festival to remember departed relatives, a celebration of Mexican-ness, an ancient holiday with roots in the Aztec Empire, a not-so-ancient Mexican spin on All Saint’s Day, the setting for  Disney’s “Coco”  – or all the above.\n \n\n   \n  “It is an act of faith, of love, of peace,” says Martha Nashieli Jiménez Bernal, Ángel’s daughter. For her, above all, the Day of the Dead is “a magical moment where life and death come together.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s 12 o’clock, welcome dad!” Martha says, waving a smoking censer back and forth over the golden flowers that snake from the garden gate into the parlor of her childhood home. “Welcome.”\n \n\n   \n  The trail of marigold petals leads to an  ofrenda , an altar covered with even more flowers, colorful cloth, fruit, candy skulls and photos of Ángel and other relatives.\n \n\n   \n  Martha breaks chunks of copal into her censer as she kneels before the altar. Standing up, she holds up a plate of  pan de Muertos –  sweet baked bread in the shape of skulls.\n \n\n   \n  “Dad, welcome to your home, with your children,” Martha says, her voice cracking with emotion. “You know we love you, and I’ve been looking forward to this day so much, to be able to be with you again. Welcome, Ángel Jiménez.”\n \n\n   \n     Changing times \n \n\n   \n  In recent years, celebrations for the Day of the Dead have taken on new influences,   some gleaned from Hollywood.\n \n\n   \n  The same day that the Jiménez family was welcoming their loved ones in the intimacy of their house, a popular parade for the Day of the Dead filled the streets of Mexico City. The practice is very new: it was adopted after the 2015 James Bond movie “Spectre”    showed Daniel Craig making his way through a lively Day of the Dead parade in its opening scene.\n \n\n   \n  Even in San Andrés Mixquic, known for its traditional celebrations, some wear the sort of spooky Halloween costumes sold in the United States, although local families themselves do not dress up.\n \n\n   \n  For the Jiménez family, the Day of the Dead is a deeply personal tradition. They take pride in preparing their altar with fruits from the local market and carefully cleaning their relatives’ headstones. Martha even gathers the flowers by hand from the family’s  chinampa , a traditional floating garden the Aztecs cultivated hundreds of years ago, making the ritual both intimate and rooted in family history.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a treasure, it is a gift. It is an inheritance that we are living,” says Leonor Bernal Roque, Martha’s mother. Her earliest memory is of her grandfather decorating their family’s altar when she was five years old.\n \n\n   \n  “From the age of five,” she says, “I began to feel love for my ancestors.”\n \n\n   \n  The Day of the Dead teaches “that death is a transition, it is not a punishment,” she says. People “must practice gratitude toward their ancestors.”\n \n\n   \n  “Memory should be important,” Leonor says.\n \n\n   \n     History lesson \n \n\n   \n  The Day of the Dead unfolds over three days in San Andrés Mixquic. On October 31, the family commemorates the souls of children at the altar. The next day, November 1, they greet their adult relatives, like Martha’s father Angel. The third day, families gather at the cemetery from morning till night to decorate graves and say goodbye.\n \n\n   \n  While the holiday has its roots in the Aztec empire prior to Spain’s conquest in 1521, the modern-day celebration blends indigenous Mexican themes with the European Christian tradition of All Saint’s Day, when some Christians visit their departed loved ones in cemeteries.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after arriving in the Americas , Spanish monks noticed the Aztecs had their own celebrations to commune with departed ancestors, according to historian Héctor Zaraus.\n \n\n   \n  “In the Aztec, Zapotec, and Mayan calendar, one of the months was dedicated to the dead, and it was   adapted to the first and second of November with the arrival of the Spanish,” says Zaraus, a scholar at the Mora Institute in Mexico City.\n \n\n   \n  The indigenous elements are the most prominent parts of the contemporary ceremony, Zaraus says, especially the tombs festooned with marigolds. Even the photographs on family altars have their roots in ancient times: Zaraus says the Aztecs “used clay figures to portray the dead.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s more than one way to celebrate the Day of the Dead, however. María del Carmen Eugenia Reyes Ruiz, professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, notes that the celebration differs throughout Mexico. She also says that, while some aspects of the modern-day celebration may have ancient roots, others are far more recent additions than might commonly be believed.\n \n\n   \n  “As for the way we celebrate it in Mexico – with colors, candles, altars, and flower paths – I think it’s also worth noting that it isn’t common throughout the entire country, and it’s certainly not as ancient as it’s often made to seem,” Reyes says. “It’s a very romantic and beautiful idea, but not entirely accurate.”\n \n\n   \n  Plenty of other cultures have similar ceremonies, some older than Mexico’s, Reyes says. For thousands of years, families in China have celebrated  Qingming  after the spring equinox, cleaning and decorating their ancestor’s graves and offering plates of sweet dumplings.\n \n\n   \n  “Although it may sound a little unromantic, there’s something I’d like to make clear,” Reyes says. “The idea of the Day of the Dead celebration, while it is indeed part of Mexican culture, is not exclusive to Mexico.”\n \n\n   \n     The doorway closes \n \n\n   \n  The sun has set in San Andrés Mixquic, but the cemetery here is filled with light. Nearly everyone in town is here for the signature, final celebration of the Day of the Dead. The door between this world and the next is about to close, and it’s time to say goodbye.\n \n\n   \n  After days of cleaning graves and decorating tombstones, the graveyard is awash in color and flickering candles. It’s loud – people are cheerfully talking, remembering their loved ones, playing music, eating food and toasting with mezcal. The bells in the church nearby are tolling.\n \n\n   \n  Even as tourists from around the world wander the cemetery, the Jiménez family treats the holiday as a sacred communion, inviting outsiders only to witness and participate respectfully. Martha says that even these tourists, some of whom come from places as far as Japan, are playing a part in the festivities: their curiosity is part of what keeps the tradition alive.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a kind of communion,” she muses as she stands at her father’s grave. “A bond is formed, a connection with them. Even if we don’t know them, we know they come with respect and a desire to learn about our traditions. So, we invite them to come respectfully – to come live our tradition, to get to know it, to preserve it, to take it back to their own homes.”\n \n\n   \n  Diana, Martha’s 19-year-old niece, agrees. She’s made up her face to look like a skull and holds a candle under her chin.\n \n\n   \n  “Tourists, if they have a family member, can also set up their own offering, and in this way, this tradition won’t die,” Diana says. “My family, especially my aunt (Martha), is the one who has instilled this tradition in us so much.”\n \n\n   \n  As the night ends in the graveyard, the family toasts Ángel with mezcal.\n \n\n   \n  “My family is happy and joyful because these were days of hard work, days of great effort,” Martha says. “Some siblings came from far away; others could not be here.”\n \n\n   \n  Martha does not have children, but she knows that she’s entrusted her nieces and nephews with the traditions to keep the Day of the Dead alive long after she’s buried in this cemetery herself.\n \n\n   \n  “I just want them to also welcome me the day I depart,” Martha says. “I want them not to forget me, to know that their aunt will come, and that I love them in the most organic way possible. That they receive me with all the love I gave them – and I know they will. I’m sure of it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/presidential-pardons-trump-biden-gop","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"16:08:00-05:00","title":"Trump Admits He Doesn’t Know Whom He’s Pardoning, Echoing GOP Criticism of Biden","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores a growing political controversy in which both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are accused of lacking personal knowledge about significant presidential pardons.

Trump now admits he doesn’t know whom he’s pardoning \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:08 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Republicans issued  a report  last week suggesting Joe Biden wasn’t really calling the shots as president. And they argued that his presidential pardons epitomized this dynamic.\n \n\n   \n  Biden appeared so disengaged from the process, the House Oversight Committee’s report claimed, that it called into question “the validity of all pardons reportedly granted” by him.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson later said Biden mass-pardoned people without knowing “what the categories were apparently — much less the individual people that he pardoned.”\n \n\n   \n  But President Donald Trump now says he didn’t know much about one of his own most controversial recent pardons — that of  Changpeng Zhao , founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance.\n \n\n   \n  The president also emphasized that he was relying on things people around him said.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know who he is,” Trump said in  a “60 Minutes” interview  that aired Sunday. He soon added that he knew “nothing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Back on October 23, Trump offered similar comments. When pressed on the pardon by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Trump  didn’t seem to know who Collins was asking about , despite the pardon having been issued the very same day.\n \n\n   \n  “Oh, the recent one, yes,” Trump said when Collins refreshed his memory. “I believe we’re talking about the same person, because I do pardon a lot of people.”\n \n\n   \n  (In fact, Zhao was the only person Trump had pardoned that week.)\n \n\n   \n  The GOP’s fixation on Biden and his use of the autopen has  long strained the known facts . The argument seems to be that Biden’s actions were invalid because he supposedly wasn’t making the decisions.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump keeps complicating that message by disclaiming his own role in and knowledge of major decisions — the kinds of things a president should be aware of. It’s not just pardons; he’s done it repeatedly with  major foreign policy decisions .\n \n\n   \n  While Trump has pardoned an extraordinary number of allies and Republicans, the Zhao pardon is on a different level because of the seeming personal conflicts of interest involved.\n \n\n   \n  It’s controversial because Binance is the cryptocurrency exchange that hosts the Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The pardon could allow it to operate in the US again. Binance has also been a significant platform for the sale of World Liberty Financial’s proprietary tokens, which have netted the Trump family hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, Binance has helped and could help the Trump family make a lot of money, and the president pardoned someone who plays a significant role in that.\n \n\n   \n  For these reasons, the pardon has earned comparisons to some of the  most controversial pardons in modern history , including former President Bill Clinton’s pardon of billionaire fugitive Marc Rich after Rich’s ex-wife donated to Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  But to hear Trump tell it, he made this monumental decision without really digging into the situation himself. He has repeatedly suggested he was basically doing what others urged him to do.\n \n\n   \n  “I have no idea who he is,” Trump told “60 Minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  “I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people — of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration.”\n \n\n   \n  The president added: “Well, here’s the thing: I know nothing about it because I’m too busy.”\n \n\n   \n  Back on October 23 — the day of the pardon — Trump said: “I don’t know him. I don’t believe I’ve ever met him. But I’ve been told … he had a lot of support. And they said that what he did is not even a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s all pretty difficult to square with the GOP’s rhetoric about Biden, including last week’s House Oversight Committee report.\n \n\n   \n  “The authority to grant pardons is not provided to the president’s inner circle,”  the report  said. “Nor can it be delegated to particular staff when a president’s competency is in question.”\n \n\n   \n  The report also faulted the Biden administration for giving the Democratic president  talking points to discuss his more controversial pardons. It intimated that this suggested Biden hadn’t played a major role in them.\n \n\n   \n  “It is striking that President Biden needed any notecards or talking points to talk about his son[’s pardon], especially about a decision recently made about him,” the report said.\n \n\n   \n  House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer suggested the fact that pardons were presented to Biden in memo form suggested he wasn’t involved enough.\n \n\n   \n  “Some staffer would type a memo, then Joe Biden would read the memo authorizing the use of the autopen, then sign his initial and then someone used that memo,” the Kentucky Republican  told CNN’s Jake Tapper  last week.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed Monday by CNN’s Manu Raju to account for the similarities between what the oversight report alleged about Biden and what Trump said on “60 Minutes,” Johnson  demurred .\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know anything about that,” the speaker said. “I didn’t see the interview. You’d have to ask the president about that. I’m not sure.”\n \n\n   \n  Comer likewise punted on Monday. He explained that Trump sometimes “says things, and we have to really analyze and give him another opportunity to make sure he didn’t misspeak, and things like that.”\n \n\n   \n  Comer suggested the president might have misspoken despite Trump having said such things twice, more than a week apart.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump himself has attacked Biden for allegedly knowing too little about his own pardons.\n \n\n   \n  “I would say that they’re null and void, because I’m sure Biden didn’t have any idea that it was taking place,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One in March.\n \n\n   \n  Trump added in  a social media post  the next day: “In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!”\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward nearly eight   months, and Trump seems to be making a similar argument about himself. Not only has he insisted he doesn’t know much about one of his most controversial pardons to date, but he also didn’t seem to have any idea what a reporter was talking about when questioned on the topic.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the similarities, we probably shouldn’t hold our breath for the GOP-led House Oversight Committee to launch a similar probe into Trump.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reaction.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/fed-governor-lisa-cook-makes-first-public-remarks-since-trump-said-he-fired-her","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:54:00Z","title":"Embattled Fed Governor Lisa Cook Makes First Public Remarks Since Trump Said He Fired Her","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook made her first public remarks since President Donald Trump claimed to have fired her, marking a pivotal moment in a high-stakes legal battle over presidential power and central bank independence.

  2:54 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Interest rates are in a good place to deal with persistently elevated inflation, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said Monday in her first public remarks since President Donald Trump  said he had fired her. \n \n\n   \n  Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, is the first central bank official to ever be subject to a firing attempt. In a letter announcing her removal, Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud, which still haven’t been taken to court. Cook sued Trump shortly afterwards, in what has become  a landmark case on presidential power and Fed independence  that will be decided next year   by the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  The court ruled that Cook  can remain in her role for now , and has scheduled oral arguments in January. Cook said Monday she is “beyond grateful” for the support she’s received in her legal battle with the Trump administration, but didn’t comment further on the topic.\n \n\n   \n  Cook has voted to lower interest rates in the past two Fed meetings, but hadn’t commented publicly on the economy since before Trump said in August that he fired her. Fed officials routinely participate in public events to lay out their views on the economy in the spirit of transparency and helping investors understand the direction of monetary policy.\n \n\n   \n  In prepared remarks for an event in Washington, DC, Cook offered a balanced perspective on the US economy, detailing the twin threat to the central bank’s dual mandate of stable prices and full employment.\n \n\n   \n  She pointed to signs of strain in the labor market, such as rising Black unemployment, but suggested there’s more urgency to finish the job on inflation than to lower rates further to prevent mass layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be clear. I am committed to reaching our 2% inflation target,” she said. “I see the current policy rate as remaining modestly restrictive, which is appropriate given that inflation remains somewhat above our 2% target.”\n \n\n   \n    The heated Fed debate\n \n\n   \n  Cook’s latest comments come at a time when Fed policymakers  are divided  on how Trump’s economic policies might impact prices, employment and economic growth.\n \n\n   \n  There were “strongly differing views” among officials at last week’s rate-setting meeting, when the Fed lowered rates  for the second time in a row , Chair Jerome Powell said in a post-meeting news conference. Two Fed officials cast dissenting votes, but for opposing reasons: Fed Governor Stephen Miran voted in favor a larger, half-point cut; while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid preferred to hold borrowing costs steady.\n \n\n   \n  That was the first time since 2019 there were dissents calling for both easier and tighter policy.\n \n\n   \n  On one side, Fed officials argue that any inflation spurred by Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy will likely prove to be a one-off price increase and that the US labor market is at serious risk of falling off a cliff if the Fed doesn’t continue to lower rates.

\nUpdated: \n        3:58 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two men face federal charges for allegedly plotting an ISIS-inspired Halloween attack in the US – possibly on the scale of the  2015 Paris terror attacks  that killed at least 130 people, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  An FBI raid on Halloween morning stunned neighbors in Dearborn, the  second-safest city in Michigan  and home to the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud face charges of “Receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to a criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  “Our newly unsealed complaint reveals a major ISIS-linked terror plot,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi  posted on X .\n \n\n   \n  “According to the complaint, subjects had multiple AR-15 rifles, tactical gear, and a detailed plan to carry out an attack on American soil,” she said, thanking officials for averting an attack “before innocent lives were lost.”\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, Ali and Mahmoud could face up to 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud’s attorney, William “Bill” Swor, told CNN his client and Ali are both 20 years old. He declined to provide additional details.\n \n\n   \n  CNN asked Ali’s attorney for comment after the criminal complaint was released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  A detention hearing for both men is scheduled for November 10.\n \n\n   \n    Suspects bought AR-15-style rifles and over 1,600 rounds of ammo, agent says \n \n\n   \n  Ali and an unidentified juvenile were “planning to conduct a terrorist attack in the United States on behalf of the designated foreign terrorist organization ISIS,” an FBI agent wrote in the criminal complaint, citing communications on an encrypted app.\n \n\n   \n  Further investigation revealed Mahmoud and others were co-conspirators in the plot, the agent said.\n \n\n   \n  Ali purchased a shotgun, an AR-15-style rifle and multiple accessories, including “a forced reset trigger that allows a shooter to increase the rate of fire in a semiautomatic weapon,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud also bought an AR-15-style rifle and more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition that could be used in AR-15 style rifles he and Ali had purchased, the agent said.\n \n\n   \n    A suspect mentions doing the ‘same thing as France’ on Halloween\n \n\n   \n  In addition to meeting in person, Ali, Mahmoud, the juvenile and co-conspirators chatted online, sharing “extremist and ISIS-related materials that encourage attacks similar to what they planned,” the FBI agent wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Ali and the juvenile “discussed when to conduct their attack, which they appeared to set for Halloween,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  The pair allegedly said they were going to do the “same thing as France,” the complaint says. And a conversation with a co-conspirator included mention of someone potentially going “to Paris for a 2015.”\n \n\n   \n  The agent took this to be a reference to the multifaceted terror rampage in France, which  killed at least 130 people in 2015 . ISIS claimed responsibility for those attacks.\n \n\n   \n  ISIS also claimed responsibility for a 2016 mass shooting in Orlando. The massacre at the Pulse nightclub, which was popular with the LGBTQ community,  killed 49 people .\n \n\n   \n  Ali, Mahmoud and the juvenile traveled to clubs in Ferndale, Michigan, the FBI complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  “All three of these clubs are located on Woodward Avenue near East Nine Mile,” the agent wrote. “Many of the clubs and bars in this area intentionally attract members of the LGBTQ+ community.”\n \n\n   \n    How a Halloween raid unfolded\n \n\n   \n  In the predawn hours of Halloween, residents of a quaint Michigan neighborhood were jolted awake by the blasts of detonated smoke bombs and a voice shouting in Arabic.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the FBI. We have a warrant. All residents inside … come out with nothing in your hands,” a man yelled before armed federal agents stormed the home in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, FBI Director Kash Patel  boasted on X  the agency had “thwarted a potential terrorist attack” and arrested “multiple” people in Dearborn “allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  Considered to be the heart of Arab America, Dearborn is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States and has frequently faced Islamophobic and hateful remarks.  Abdullah Hammoud , the son of Lebanese immigrants, became the first Arab American mayor of Dearborn when he was elected in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the community, including neighbors and attorneys for the people taken into custody, say they are skeptical of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  One of the neighbors is Laraib Irfan, who says his Dearborn community is a close-knit, peaceful place where everyone looks out for each other like family.\n \n\n   \n  Irfan was woken up Friday morning by his sister, telling him the FBI agents were outside. He heard two bangs he described as so loud they sounded like bombs and gunfire.\n \n\n   \n  He watched in shock as FBI agents surrounded the house two doors away from his. To his knowledge, the house was home to a family of seven – a mother, father and five sons.\n \n\n   \n  At the sound of the FBI’s command, the residents stepped out of their home with their hands behind their backs, Irfan said. For hours afterward, agents filed in and out, carrying materials to gather evidence, as Michigan State Police cordoned off the surrounding streets, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others questioned, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case told CNN on Friday; their ages range from 16 to no more than 29. Amir Makled, who represents Ali, told CNN on Sunday three people were arrested and two were questioned. CNN has reached out to the FBI for clarification.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled told CNN before the criminal complaint was released.\n \n\n   \n  The two law enforcement sources told CNN about a reference to “pumpkin day,” an online chat about an ISIS-inspired attack and a shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Hussein Bazzi, who said he is representing another suspect arrested in the raid, told CNN the “pumpkin” day reference may have been “online gamer chat that was misinterpreted.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI told CNN it was conducting law enforcement activities in the cities of Dearborn and nearby Inkster, Michigan, but has not responded to CNN’s request for additional comment.    \n \n\n   \n  Patel’s initial X post applauded the FBI for “crushing our mission to defend the homeland,” yet he gave no explanation or evidence to support claims of a foiled terrorist plot.\n \n\n   \n  “More details to come,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s curious to me,” Colin Clarke, a domestic terrorism and international security expert, told CNN prior to the release of the criminal complaint. “What it makes me think is that the plot wasn’t maybe as mature as they led people to believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke, executive director of the security research nonprofit The Soufan Center, says authorities may be holding back details to protect a potential prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re waiting to comment on it so they don’t go out and say anything that ends up hurting them in a court case,” said Clarke, who has no direct knowledge of the investigation. “Or there’s not much to this, the plot, there wasn’t much there.”\n \n\n   \n  Only time will reveal the full story, he said. The delay in charges often depends on how long the FBI has been tracking an alleged plot. His central concern, he added, is whether the claim the plot was inspired by ISIS has any basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Was there an actual ISIS operative communicating with these individuals, or were they just communicating with one another?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But for Dearborn’s community, the prolonged silence from authorities is raising serious concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “An allegation like this is dangerous to this community,” Makled said. “So when you have the national director of the FBI putting out a statement that there was a thwarted terrorist attack and then the news covers the raids of homes in the city of Dearborn, immediately the backlash on the internet is homegrown terrorist cell.”\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the raid posted on  Facebook  sparked bigoted comments: “A real shocker that they reside in Dearborn,” one person wrote. “Well, Dearborn does have a major Islamic population who aren’t exactly friendly to anyone else,” said another. Some accused the people in the home of being “sleeper cells.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Dearborn’s large Arab population, which makes up nearly half the city, makes it an easy target for Islamophobic, racist comments, the city has been ranked the second-safest large city in Michigan, according to the FBI’s  2024 annual crime report .\n \n\n   \n  “This community has been part of the state of Michigan for generations,” Makled, a Lebanese American and lifelong Dearborn resident, said. “They’re deeply ingrained in the American fabric here and this community, they’re sick and tired of being held to a different standard.”\n \n\n   \n  A neighbor, who asked to only be identified as “Ahmed,” said the people who lived in the home were kind, and he was not convinced the raid was based on credible suspicion.\n \n\n   \n  “You never hear anything from them, they are perfect, smiling, and I do not believe anything happened (from them), they are very good people,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the FBI’s claim they stopped a terrorist plot, Ahmed interrupts and rejects the possibility completely: “No, no, no, no,” he says. “I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   \n  Another neighbor, Kathy Sisson, also speaks highly of her community; she says she’s disabled and her neighbors, who are from Brazil, Pakistan and Iraq, are constantly checking on her to make sure she’s OK.\n \n\n   \n  A person in the home where the FBI activity took place who did not want to share their name told CNN the people taken into custody “were just kids” and the situation was “being blown out of proportion and shouldn’t have happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke warned against hasty conclusions but expressed skepticism that officials could credibly claim a foiled terrorist plot without clear, compelling evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “For the administration to come out and say they thwarted a plot, I feel like they (would need) stronger evidence than just a bunch of teenagers talking sh*t in a chat room,” Clarke said.\n \n\n   \n  Makled said his client’s mother has not stopped crying.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that my client has stopped thinking or slept for one second since the moment he’s been taken into custody because of how deeply concerned he is about what the future is bringing,” he said. “He has no control in terms of what the federal government is going to say about him.”\n \n\n   \n    Muslim American communities are exhausted\n \n\n   \n  For many, the incident harks back to the post-9/11 era, when Arab Americans were routinely subjected to false stereotypes, covert surveillance, unequal restrictions and, all too often, threats from people who were violent and driven by hate.\n \n\n   \n  “I know what went on after 9/11 and how our Arab and Muslim communities felt after that,” Clarke said. “Of course they’re under the microscope, even with the New York City  mayor’s race , you see a lot of Islamophobia kind of rearing its head again. We just don’t know.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the attack on the Twin Towers in New York, the FBI has prevented  numerous  suspected terrorist attacks by running undercover operations, where agents say they have infiltrated extremist networks to catch people who would have committed crimes.\n \n\n   \n  However, Muslims have often borne the brunt of racialized state surveillance. Many were suspected of domestic terrorism, through everyday actions that were disproportionately scrutinized and subjected to FBI attention solely because of their faith, according to a  2018 study published in Critical Sociology  examining patterns of surveillance targeting Muslim communities.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to be targeted and always looked at with a sense of suspicion. Dearborn’s used to this,” Makled said. “This community doesn’t want to be held in that light of suspicion anymore, and it doesn’t deserve to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Michigan chapter of the Council on American–Islamic Relations criticized the FBI’s lack of transparency in the days after the arrests. Executive Director Dawud Walid stressed that, no matter what the investigation uncovers, Muslims in Dearborn and across the US do not owe anyone an apology for the actions of others.\n \n\n   \n  “People in the community are getting tired of this idea of collective guilt, or somehow we have to answer for the alleged actions of a couple of people,” Walid told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Makled urged the public to withhold judgment and wait for the results of the investigation before making assumptions about the community as additional details from the FBI are still pending.\n \n\n   \n  If Patel put out a statement prematurely, “I would demand an apology from the national director,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how you create unity,” he added. “And that’s how you cure any error or harm that was caused by a mistake. This community is very forgiving, and we would accept that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/colorado-funeral-home-bodies-fake-ashes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:05:00Z","title":"Judge Rejects Plea Deal for Funeral Home Owner Accused of Stashing Nearly 190 Decaying Bodies","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Colorado judge has rejected a plea deal offered to funeral home owners Carie and Jon Hallford, who were accused of illegally storing nearly 190 decaying bodies in a rural building between 2019 and 2023.

  \n  Paramount has renewed Jon Stewart’s deal to continue hosting Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” once a week through the 2026 midterms, resolving months of speculation about the media company’s plans for the late-night show.\n \n\n   \n  Comedy Central said Monday that the show’s correspondents will continue to take turns hosting Tuesdays through Thursdays while Stewart hosts on Mondays.\n \n\n   \n  Stewart originally returned to his old show in 2024 — after first hosting from 1999 until 2015 — saying he wanted a platform to “unload thoughts as we get into this election season.”\n \n\n   \n  He still had plenty to say after President Trump returned to office in January, and he remained a reliable ratings magnet.\n \n\n   \n  However, fans began to worry about his future at Comedy Central when Paramount went through a protracted merger process and made several concessions to the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  In July, CBS, a corporate sibling of Comedy Central, cancelled “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” leading many, including Stewart, a friend of Colbert’s and a producer of “The Late Show,” to question the stated rationale.\n \n\n   \n  “Was this purely financial?” Stewart asked in a scathing monologue. “Or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger was killing a show that you know rankled a fragile and vengeful president.”\n \n\n   \n  Media analysts noted at the time that Stewart’s contract at “The Daily Show” was expiring at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  New owners took charge of Paramount in August and signaled hopes to revitalize cable channels like Comedy Central, while cutting costs at the same time.\n \n\n   \n  Disney’s decision in September to suspend ABC late-night star Jimmy Kimmel amid pressure from the Trump administration furthered questions about the entire late-night TV landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Stewart’s position was clear. He had “more or less laid down his gauntlet about his intention not to cave as so many other media companies, law firms, and academic institutions have under bullying from Washington,” wrote Bill Carter, the author of two books about late-night TV.\n \n\n   \n  In an on-stage interview last week with Stewart, The New Yorker editor David Remnick brought up widespread perceptions of media moguls capitulating to President Trump and asked about Stewart’s status.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re working on staying,” Stewart responded.\n \n\n   \n  Now the deal is done, according to Monday’s press release from Paramount. Stewart will continue hosting and executive producing the show through December 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Ari Pearce, head of Comedy Central, said in a statement that Stewart’s return “is an ongoing commitment to the incisive comedy and sharp commentary that define The Daily Show.”\n \n\n   \n  He added, “We’re proud to support Jon and the extraordinary news team.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/cybersecurity-ransomeware-hacking","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"13:57:00-05:00","title":"Two Former Cybersecurity Employees Indicted for Hacking and Ransoming U.S. Firms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two former cybersecurity professionals, Kevin Tyler Martin and Ryan Clifford Goldberg, have been indicted for using ransomware—specifically the ALPHV strain—to extort U.S. companies, including a Florida medical device firm, a Maryland pharmaceutical firm, and a Virginia drone maker.

\nUpdated: \n        1:57 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two former employees of cybersecurity firms that sold services helping companies combat hackers have been indicted and accused of participating in a conspiracy, outside of their day jobs, to hack multiple US firms and extort them for millions of dollars.\n \n\n   \n  The two men are accused of deploying ransomware used by a prolific cybercriminal gang in attacks in 2023 against a medical device firm in Florida, a pharmaceutical firm in Maryland and a drone maker in Virginia, among other alleged victims.\n \n\n   \n  Kevin Tyler Martin of Roanoke, Texas, and Ryan Clifford Goldberg of Watkinsville, Georgia, face matching federal charges including interfering in interstate commerce through extortion and intentionally damaging a protected computer, according to an indictment filed in the US Southern District of Florida last month.\n \n\n   \n  The men — and an unnamed alleged co-conspirator — are accused of demanding approximately $10 million from the Florida-based medical device maker to unlock the firm’s data, and ultimately received about $1.27 million, according to the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for Martin and Goldberg declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a case of cyber experts allegedly switching sides in the fight against ransomware. The thriving ransomware market has grown into a threat that has disrupted critical services across the US and cost the economy billions of dollars.\n \n\n   \n  Cybersecurity firms often work very closely with the FBI and international law enforcement to track down and collect evidence on ransomware gangs, which operate across borders and time zones. Many prominent security firms have been integral to helping law enforcement put accused ransomware operators in cuffs.\n \n\n   \n  “Companies, governments and people put a lot of trust in us to try to keep them safe,” Allan Liska, who has tracked ransomware for years for cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, told CNN. “Incidents like this erode that trust and make an already difficult job even more challenging.”\n \n\n   \n  The Chicago Sun-Times first  reported  on the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Martin worked for DigitalMint, an Illinois-based firm that helps victims recover from ransomware attacks and in some cases pays ransoms, according to its website. Goldberg worked for Sygnia Cybersecurity Services, a multinational firm whose offerings include simulating ransomware attacks for clients.\n \n\n   \n  Martin acted “completely outside the scope of his employment,” DigitalMint said in a statement to CNN on Monday. “As expected, the indictment does not allege that the company had any knowledge of or involvement in the criminal activity. DigitalMint has been and continues to be a cooperating witness in the investigation and not an investigative target.”\n \n\n   \n  “The charged conduct took place outside of DigitalMint’s infrastructure and systems,” DigitalMint’s statement continued. “The co-conspirators did not access or compromise client data as part of the charged conduct.”\n \n\n   \n  DigitalMint said the unnamed co-conspirator who is listed as a defendant in the indictment “may have also been a company employee.”\n \n\n   \n  “No one potentially involved in the charged scheme has worked at the company in over 4 months,” DigitalMint said.\n \n\n   \n  Sygnia Cybersecurity Services said it terminated Goldberg’s employment “immediately upon learning of the situation.”\n \n\n   \n  “While Sygnia is not a target of this investigation, we are continuing to work closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” Sygnia said in its statement. “We cannot provide further comment on the ongoing federal investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  In their alleged attacks, Martin and Goldberg are accused of using a ransomware known as ALPHV, one of the more prolific strains of ransomware in recent years. Like others in the ransomware ecosystem, ALPHV’s developers sell the code to hackers and then share the proceeds of the attacks, according to prosecutors and cyber experts.\n \n\n   \n  ALPHV was allegedly used in a debilitating ransomware attack last year on insurance billing giant  Change Healthcare , which cut off health providers from billions in revenue and snarled service at pharmacies across the US. Martin and Goldberg are not accused of involvement in that attack.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/himalaya-peak-avalanche-nepal-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"Avalanche on Nepal mountain Yalung Ri kills 7 including foreign climbers","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An avalanche on Mount Yalung Ri in Nepal killed seven people, including five foreign climbers and two Nepali guides, while injuring five others at the base camp.

administration will provide only half of usual food stamp benefits in November \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:02 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration said Monday that it will provide only half of the normal  food stamp benefits  for November by tapping into the program’s contingency fund amid the  government shutdown . But recipients are not likely to see the payments immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Some $4.65 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s contingency fund will “be obligated to cover 50% of eligible households’ current allotments” for November, according to a  sworn statement  from a US Department of Agriculture official submitted in federal court. The remaining $600 million in the fund will be used for state administrative expenses and nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico and American Samoa.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came after a federal judge in Rhode Island  ordered  the USDA last week to either start providing full November benefits to recipients or partial benefits if the agency opts to only draw on SNAP’s contingency fund.\n \n\n   \n  In court papers filed Monday, the administration said it decided against pulling $4 billion from other sources of money to provide full benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n   Nearly 42 million Americans  receive food stamps, providing households just over $350 a month, on average, as of May, according to the most recent USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  The agency’s  unprecedented decision  to halt benefits has panicked many recipients, driving them to overwhelmed  food pantries  to help feed themselves and their families. Millions of SNAP recipients started missing their benefits on Saturday, and millions more could find themselves in the same situation over the course of the month, depending on when payments are made.\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  Though the USDA will provide guidance on the partial payments to states on Monday, the agency noted that recipients in some states may not see their November benefits for weeks – or even months, Patrick Penn, the USDA official, told the court.   \n \n\n   \n  The partial payments will require states to reprogram their systems to adjust for the reduced allotments, which could prove complicated.\n \n\n   \n  “Given the variation among State systems, some of which are decades old, it is unclear how many States will complete the changes in an automated manner with minimal disruption versus manual overrides or computations that could lead to payment errors and significant delays,” Penn said.\n \n\n   \n  States  stopped the process  of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. The agency said that it does not have the funds to pay November’s assistance amid the federal government shutdown, which began October 1\n \n\n   \n  States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  Providing full benefits for November would be easier and faster, but Penn said the USDA decided against dipping into a pot of money meant to fund child nutrition programs to help cover that cost because it “would leave an unprecedented gap” in that funding source, which ordinarily provides free or low-cost meals for school children, among other things.\n \n\n   \n  “USDA has determined that creating a shortfall in Child Nutrition Program funds to fund one month of SNAP benefits is an unacceptable risk … because shifting $4 billion dollars to America’s SNAP population merely shifts the problem to millions of America’s low income children that receive their meals at school,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  That funding source, which consists of leftover tariff revenue, currently contains nearly $17 billion.\n \n\n   \n    Court rulings\n \n\n   \n  In his ruling last week, Judge John McConnell, of the federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, gave the administration until 12 p.m. ET on Monday to say what it plans to do.\n \n\n   \n  A second federal judge, in Boston, issued a similar order last week, saying the agency was required to use SNAP’s contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Both judges said it was up to the agency’s discretion whether to access other money to enable it to provide full payments.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA had maintained that it could not tap into its contingency fund, stating in a memo that “contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.” Also, it noted that the contingency funds are meant to pay food benefits in the case of natural disasters.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump indicated Friday evening that he wants benefits to resume,  posting  on Truth Social that he instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible because the attorneys “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available.”\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump wrote. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration has opted to draw on the leftover tariff funds to fund other priorities. The USDA last month transferred  $300 million  from that pot in order to temporarily continue providing WIC food assistance for pregnant women, new moms and young children.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to halt benefits prompted a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, to file a lawsuit in Boston on Tuesday and a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to bring the case in Rhode Island on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Democracy Forward, which represents the plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case, said on Monday that it wasn’t satisfied with the administration’s decision to make only partial SNAP payments and that it is “considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.”\n \n\n   \n  “It shouldn’t take a court order to force our President to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,” said Skye Perryman, the group’s president and CEO, in a statement. “Rest assured, we will continue to fight so that people have the full benefits they are entitled to under SNAP.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/government-shutdown-snap-uncertainty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:43:00-05:00","title":"Uncertainty Persists for SNAP Recipients, Federal Workers as Shutdown Drags On","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government shutdown, now in its fifth week, has severely disrupted SNAP food assistance payments, leaving millions of low-income Americans, including federal workers and recipients, in financial uncertainty.

workers as shutdown drags on \n       \n  By Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Camila DeChalus, Veronica Stracqualursi, Auzinea Bacon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:43 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Laterese Johnson has roughly a week and a half to two weeks of food benefits left to feed herself and her grandchildren, a reality that sunk in over the weekend when the government shutdown forced delays in payments for food assistance.\n \n\n   \n  “With the amount of SNAP benefits that I receive, it’s just enough to feed one person, but I have to share that with my grandchildren,” she told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on Saturday. “You know, it’s already a sacrifice.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson is one of millions of Americans, including food stamp recipients and federal workers, who are facing more uncertainty as the government shutdown enters its fifth week, with congressional Republicans and Democrats  remaining at odds  over a solution.\n \n\n   \n  While the Trump administration on Monday said it will provide partial food stamp benefits for November by tapping into the program’s contingency fund, recipients will not see payments immediately. In court papers, the administration said it decided against pulling from other sources of money to provide full SNAP benefits for the month.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came after two judges ruled last week that the Trump administration must tap into emergency funds for the roughly 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Agriculture’s contingency fund doesn’t have enough money to cover the total cost of the payments, which 3 million recipients should have received November 1. Remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested there could be progress toward ending the shutdown after Election Day this week, claiming that Democrats believe ending the impasse could harm voter turnout in key races in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. His comments came days after President Donald Trump began  ramping up pressure  on the GOP to unilaterally end the government shutdown by eliminating the Senate filibuster, a move Republican leaders  have opposed .\n \n\n   \n  Rachel Kent, a SNAP recipient, told CNN on Saturday that food should not be a political argument. “Congress can debate budgets all day, but you don’t debate whether children get to go to bed hungry,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The prolonged lapse in government funding continues to  stress food banks , charities and nonprofits set up to assist Americans in need, with federal workers going without pay also turning to those sources for aid.\n \n\n   \n  Nina Savransky, a former disaster response worker at the US Agency for International Development who volunteered at a food bank in the Washington, DC, area over the weekend, told CNN she was shocked to see the level of food insecurity brought on by the shutdown, particularly among federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  “I used to work in the disaster response bureau, and this is the disaster response now,” she told CNN. “It’s shocking to see this happen in the United States. This was support that we gave out to other countries that were unstable, and to feel that instability internally is … surprising. It’s difficult.”\n \n\n   \n     Food banks grapple with a surge in demand \n \n\n   \n  As the congressional stalemate persists, food banks across the county say the demand for their services is only rising and they will not be able to fill the gap made by delays to SNAP payments.\n \n\n   \n  “The potential is absolutely devastating, cataclysmic, in fact, for the whole nation, not only people experiencing hunger, but especially them,” Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America, told CNN’s Jessica Dean on Saturday. “For every one meal that the charitable food system can provide, SNAP has been providing nine. That’s why I’m saying ‘cataclysmic.’”\n \n\n   \n  Cara Durr, CEO of Food Bank of Alaska, said her group’s partner organization was seeing a lot of “concern and anxiety” over SNAP disruptions over the past few weeks, and that many of the communities they serve were already rattled by Typhoon Halong,  which tore through  remote, coastal communities in the state last month.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re already seeing an increase. We expect that will continue,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are reeling from the effects of a prolonged shutdown as it drags into its second month. At a food bank just outside Washington, DC, over the weekend, some became emotional as they described to CNN how the  uncertainty of their pay  and employment status has taken a toll on their finances and mental health.\n \n\n   \n  Colby, a State Department employee of 21 years who declined to give his last name, said he never imagined he’d be in line for food. “It’s different. We’ve been volunteering here for a while — we live a few blocks away. And now we’re on the receiving end. I’m just thankful it’s here.”\n \n\n   \n  Janis, a federal worker who declined to give her last name, became emotional describing how the shutdown has upended things for her family.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a big impact because now we have to choose either to feed ourselves or pay the bills,” said Janis, who did not want to disclose the agency she worked for.\n \n\n   \n  “We have young children, and we have to keep it together for them. It feels as if the government doesn’t care,” she said. “The holidays are coming — people are going to be hungry. We are the land of opportunity, and it doesn’t look like it.”\n \n\n   \n    Grocers brace for a hit\n \n\n   \n  The delays in food benefits are likely to affect not only recipients and the nonprofits that serve them, but could also lead to declining sales for grocers like Daweit Gebru, who co-owns Elmira Market with his brother in Washington, DC. He estimates that 60% to 65% of their business comes from customers using SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The market saw what was “possibly the worst time of business” last weekend, he said. Customers were more reluctant to spend money because of the shutdown, he said, and he and his brother were afraid to stock the market in case they didn’t sell anything. They forfeited part of their paychecks for the month to cover their staffs’ salaries and are now resorting to credit cards to stay afloat.\n \n\n   \n  At Zuppardo’s Family Market in Metairie, Louisiana, customer traffic remained steady over the weekend, according to owner Joseph Zuppardo. Louisiana’s Department of Health said it was moving forward with a state-funded program for SNAP households that include people who are elderly, disabled or children.\n \n\n   \n  The family-owned supermarket just outside of New Orleans has worked “extremely close under normal markups” to keep food affordable, according to Zuppardo. Long-term disruptions to SNAP could lead to as much as a 15% drop in sales, he said, adding, “we’re trying to do our part into lowering our costs.”\n \n\n   \n  At Joseph’s Market in Waterville, Maine, manager Sydney McKinnis said she is creating a November special priced under $150, potentially including basics like burgers, pork chops and bacon.\n \n\n   \n  McKinnis wants to keep it affordable “even if I have to go close to costs … just to be able to fill people’s freezers.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with the Trump administration’s plans to provide partial food benefits for November.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/portland-oregon-national-guard-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"13:02:00-05:00","title":"Federal Judge Extends Order Blocking Trump from Deploying National Guard Troops to Portland","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. federal judge, Karin Immergut, extended her order blocking President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, citing that the protests at an ICE facility were not out of control, did not constitute a 'rebellion,' and violated the Tenth Amendment by infringing on state sovereignty.

Guard troops to Portland \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, Karina Tsui, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:02 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A judge has extended her order blocking President Donald Trump from deploying any National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, until Friday – keeping soldiers in the city in limbo as the legal showdown over presidential power continues.\n \n\n   \n  US District Court Judge Karin Immergut’s decision on Sunday followed a three-day trial that saw arguments over whether the Trump administration violated the law by federalizing and trying to deploy Oregon and California troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  The legal saga over the balance of presidential and state power has seen numerous twists and turns as it unfolded in both the district court and before appeals judges.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling comes as the Trump administration faces challenges over its power to send National Guard troops into Democratic-led cities. A federal court last month  blocked the deployment  of National Guard troops in Chicago. And last week the  Supreme Court  took the rare step of asking for additional briefing in that high-profile case.\n \n\n   \n  National Guard troops have been staging at Portland training bases for weeks while the legal case plays out, having been activated to protect federal officials and an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has been  the focal point  of daily protests since June.\n \n\n   \n  Federal attorneys have argued it’s within Trump’s presidential authority to respond to the daily protests outside the facility that have subjected the building and its agents to what it described as coordinated violence.\n \n\n   \n  But state and city attorneys called the move “one of the most significant infringements” on Oregon’s sovereignty in the state’s history and argued the Trump administration is dramatically misrepresenting the situation and risking inflaming tensions.\n \n\n   \n  The order from Immergut, a  Trump appointee  from his first term, says the federal government was unable to show the situation in Portland was out of control or federal officers were unable to do their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President’s federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,” her order reads.\n \n\n   \n    Judge says protests do not justify a National Guard deployment\n \n\n   \n  Immergut preliminarily   ruled the federal government’s deployment of the National Guard in Oregon exceeded its legal authority, violated the Tenth Amendment by infringing on state sovereignty, did not meet the legal definition of a “rebellion,” and caused ongoing constitutional harm that justified immediate judicial intervention.\n \n\n   \n  She noted the trial testimony “included evidence of sporadic isolated instances of violent behavior toward federal officers and property damage to a single building,” but those incidents do not appear to be backed by an “organized group engaged in armed hostilities for the purpose of overtaking an instrumentality of government by unlawful or antidemocratic means.”\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of violence that did occur during this time period involved violence between protesters and counter-protesters and isolated sporadic incidents of low-level unlawful conduct,” the order read.\n \n\n   \n  Oregon has argued federal agents used “disproportionate” force against demonstrators, introducing surveillance video at the trial to support the claim.\n \n\n   \n  One exhibit appeared to show an agent running into a protester at full speed from behind and knocking the person to the ground. The August 13 video, provided to CNN by the Oregon Department of Justice, did not show the protester interacting with agents or any provocation immediately before being hit.\n \n\n   \n  Another video, from October 2, showed a protester who took a step across a line marking the ICE facility property immediately rushed by more than a dozen agents and taken into custody.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on those videos. A government attorney argued at  trial  that protesters have exhibited “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 250 arrests were made or citations issued against protesters at the ICE building between early June and mid-October, according to the  FBI  and  Portland Police Bureau . It is not clear how many of those taken into custody have been charged with a crime.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a separate  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  decision allowing Trump to deploy the Oregon National Guard troops to Portland is being reconsidered “en banc” by a broader 11-judge panel.  That case revolves around a now-frozen second order from Immergut that blocked the deployment of troops from Oregon. A date for the hearing was not set.\n \n\n   \n  While  400 soldiers  from Oregon and California together were federalized and sent to the greater Portland area, a Trump administration lawyer  said  in a previous hearing before the Ninth Circuit that the administration didn’t plan to deploy more than 200.\n \n\n   \n  Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued on September 28 after Trump declared he was sending National Guard troops to the city, and Immergut’s  two temporary orders  blocking those efforts closely followed.\n \n\n   \n  Then, the three-judge Ninth Circuit panel on October 20 issued a stay on Immergut’s first restraining order — a ruling that could have paved the way for a deployment as the legal battle played out. But the decision to have a new set of appeals judges rehear the case meant that the Trump administration was still barred from deploying troops.\n \n\n   \n    Insights and surprises from the trial\n \n\n   \n  The October trial Immergut presided over featured a surprising revelation: National Guard troops were on the ground at Portland’s ICE facility earlier last month even after the judge ordered them not to show up.\n \n\n   \n  Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton argued it took time to implement the order. “My clients were working to end the mission,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The trial also provided insight on what federal and National Guard officials knew – and didn’t know – when Trump called for hundreds of troops to protect the ICE facility.\n \n\n   \n  Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, a deputy regional director for the Federal Protective Service, identified in court by the initials R.C., said.\n \n\n   \n  Testifying in court, R.C. stated he and his boss, the FPS regional director, were “surprised” by the order, which they had learned about on the news.   \n \n\n   \n  A fundamental disagreement from the trial was over how extreme the demonstrations were – and whether local law enforcement can handle them.\n \n\n   \n  State and city attorneys argued a simmering protest scene only ramped up after Trump ordered Guard troops to enter Portland in late September, and while there had been “sporadic and inexcusable crimes” along with peaceful protests, they were nothing existing law enforcement couldn’t handle.\n \n\n   \n  For months, the Trump administration has argued that federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters which justifies a more forceful response.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court. Protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence, he said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/fact-check-trump-cbs-interview","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-16","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Political Leaders Intensify Diplomatic Efforts Amid Rising Regional Tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In recent weeks, political leaders across the region have intensified diplomatic efforts to address rising tensions.

We counted at least 18 inaccurate assertions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told his usual lie that the free and fair 2020 election was stolen from him. He lied again that grocery prices “are down” even after CBS’ Norah O’Donnell informed him  they are up . He declared once more that there is now “no inflation,” though there certainly is, and then that inflation is 2% or “even less than 2%,” though the most recent available Consumer Price Index figure  is now up to 3% .\n \n\n   \n  The president also deployed multiple other fictional numbers during his exchanges with O’Donnell, which were recorded Friday and released by CBS on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump made a variety of additional false claims on several subjects, including the government shutdown, the artificial intelligence boom, tariffs, his first impeachment and his former legal battle with “60 Minutes” itself.\n \n\n   \n  CBS posted a  full transcript  of the interview, which O’Donnell  said  ran for nearly 90 minutes, and a nearly 73-minute  video ; it aired  about 28 minutes  on television.\n \n\n   \n  Here is a more detailed breakdown of Trump’s claims.\n \n\n   \n    The economy\n \n\n   \n   Grocery prices \n \n\n   \n  When O’Donnell noted that Americans have “seen their grocery prices go up,” Trump repeated his regular false claim that grocery prices are actually declining: “No, you’re wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they’re going down. Other than beef, which we’re working on, which we can solve very quickly.” Trump repeated later in the interview, “Our groceries are down.”\n \n\n   \n   Grocery prices are up  under Trump — and while there has been a particularly large increase in the price of beef, there have also been increases in the price of  numerous other products .  Consumer Price Index figures  for September showed average grocery prices had increased since August (about 0.3%), since September 2024 (about 2.7%), and since January 2025 (about 1.4%), the month Trump returned to office. Prices in all six major grocery product categories tracked by the Consumer Price Index, such as “fruits and vegetables” and “cereals and bakery products,” are up over the past year.\n \n\n   \n   Inflation under Trump \n \n\n   \n  Trump falsely claimed, “We have no inflation” and “we don’t have any inflation.” (He said at another point of the interview that “essentially we don’t have inflation.”) He also falsely claimed, “We’re down to 2%, even less than 2%.” There is inflation; it has been  worsening since May  after hitting a four-year low in April; and it’s not 2% or less than 2%. The year-over-year rate was about  3% in September , up from about  2.9% in August ; the September figure was nearly identical to the roughly  3% rate in January , the last partial month of the Biden administration and first partial month of the second Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n   Inflation under Biden \n \n\n   \n  Trump falsely claimed that President Joe “Biden gave me the worst inflation rate in the history of our country” and that “I inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country.” Trump could have fairly said the US inflation  rate hit a 40-year high under Biden in June 2022 , when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the  all-time record of 23.7% , set in 1920 — and, again, the rate then declined to about 3% in January 2025, the month Trump took over from Biden. Trump’s claim was also wrong if he was claiming there was record cumulative inflation over the course of Biden’s presidency. It was about 21%, compared with about 49% during President Jimmy Carter’s term.\n \n\n   \n   Investment in the US \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his frequent false claim that “we have $17 trillion being invested in the United States right now,” then said moments later that it is “more than $17 trillion right now.” This “$17 trillion” figure is fictional even without the “more than.” As of the time the “60 Minutes” interview aired on Sunday, the White House’s  own website  said the “major investment announcements” this term totaled “$8.9 trillion” — and a detailed CNN review in October found the White House was counting trillions of dollars in vague investment pledges from foreign countries and companies, pledges that were about “bilateral trade” or “economic exchange” rather than investment in the US, or vague statements that didn’t even rise to the level of pledges. You can read more  here .\n \n\n   \n   Who pays tariffs \n \n\n   \n  Trump claimed, as he often does, that China and other foreign countries pay the tariffs he has imposed on their exports. In reality, US importers, not China or other foreign countries, make the tariff payments to the US government, and they often pass on at least some of the costs to consumers;  study  after  study , including  one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission ,  found  that people and entities in the US bore almost the entire cost of Trump’s first-term tariffs on Chinese products.\n \n\n   \n   AI and power \n \n\n   \n  Trump correctly noted that some artificial intelligence companies are moving to  generate their own power  on the same sites as their energy-hungry data centers — but falsely added that letting companies make their own electricity “was my idea, which nobody, frankly, had thought of.” There is simply no basis for Trump’s claim that he came up with this idea. News articles last year, when Trump was an out-of-office candidate for president, discussed how AI companies were  already experimenting with on-site power generation  and how the Biden administration was on board with the idea; one article from April 2024, for example,  discussed  how the Energy Department was “exploring how energy-hungry tech firms might be able to host small nuclear plants on the campuses of their massive data centers.”\n \n\n   \n    Foreign policy\n \n\n   \n   Strikes on alleged drug boats \n \n\n   \n  After Trump was asked about the recent US military strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, he said, “Every one of those boats kills 25,000 Americans. Every single boat that you see that’s shot down kills 25,000 on drugs, and destroys families all over our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the fact that the Trump administration has not presented public proof for his repeated claims that the boats carried fentanyl, the drug involved in the highest number of US overdose deaths — the Caribbean is  not known  to be a significant fentanyl-smuggling route — his “25,000” number does not make sense. The  total  number of US overdose deaths from all drugs in 2024 was about 82,000, according to provisional  federal data . Trump is essentially claiming, in other words, that  attacking 16 boats  prevented more than four years’ worth of American overdose deaths.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s figure is “absurd,” Carl Latkin, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health with a joint appointment at its medical school, said in October. “He’s claiming that he’s solved the overdose mortality crisis” with four boat strikes, and “that does not have any semblance of reality.” You can read a longer fact check  here .\n \n\n   \n   Trump and wars \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his false claim that he “knocked out eight wars,” adding, “I took eight wars and stopped (them) during an eight-month period” this presidency. Reading from a paper, he listed “Cambodia-Thailand,” “Kosovo-Serbia,” “the Congo and Rwanda,” “Pakistan and India,” “Israel and Iran,” “Egypt and Ethiopia,” “Armenia and Azerbaijan,” and “Israel and Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s “eight” figure is a clear exaggeration.\n \n\n   \n  There was no war between Egypt and Ethiopia for Trump to end; the two countries were in a long-running diplomatic dispute about a  major Ethiopian dam project  on a tributary of the Nile River, but that is not a war, and the dispute is  unresolved . Trump’s list includes  another supposed war that didn’t occur  during his presidency, between Kosovo and Serbia. (He has sometimes  claimed  to have prevented the eruption of a new war between those two entities, providing few details about what he meant, but that is different from settling an actual war.) And the war involving the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda  has continued  despite a peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration this year — which was never signed by the leading rebel coalition doing the fighting.\n \n\n   \n  One can debate the importance of Trump’s role in having ended the other conflicts on his list, or fairly question whether some of them have truly ended. For example, killing has  continued  in Gaza after the October ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Regardless, Trump’s “eight” figure is too big.\n \n\n   \n   Biden and aid to Ukraine \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his false claim that “Joe Biden gave $350 billion to Ukraine, including a lot of weapons, a tremendous amount of weapons.” The “$350 billion” figure isn’t close to accurate.\n \n\n   \n  The US government inspector general overseeing the federal Ukraine response  says  the US had disbursed about $94 billion as of the end of June 2025 (and had appropriated about $93 billion more), including money that was spent in the US and in broader Europe rather than Ukraine itself. And a German think tank that has closely  tracked  wartime aid to Ukraine says the US allocated about $135 billion to Ukraine (and had committed about $5 billion more) through August, at current exchange rates.\n \n\n   \n    Immigration\n \n\n   \n   The shutdown, Democrats and immigrants \n \n\n   \n  Talking about the ongoing government shutdown, Trump said of Democrats, “I can’t give them $1.5 trillion so that they can give welfare to people that came into our country illegally.” But that is not what Democrats are seeking.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are primarily proposing to reverse Trump-approved cuts to Medicaid and other health programs and to extend the enhanced pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Undocumented people are not eligible for either Obamacare subsidies or federal Medicaid insurance coverage (though hospitals are required to provide people with emergency care regardless of immigration status or ability to pay).\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s White House itself has  claimed  that Democrats are proposing to spend about $193 billion (not $1.5 trillion) on health care for “illegal immigrants and other non-citizens” and the White House published an itemized list that makes clear that even by its own contested calculations, the majority of even that smaller sum would be for these “other non-citizens” who are in the US legally.\n \n\n   \n  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, has  estimated  that the spending proposal the Democrats released in September would add $1.5 trillion to the debt over the next decade. But that figure is not about spending on undocumented people in particular.\n \n\n   \n   Foreign leaders, prisons and migration \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his regular claim that foreign countries are deliberately emptying their prisons to somehow send inmates to the US as migrants, at one point identifying Venezuela as a supposed culprit and at another point speaking more broadly — saying “very smart” foreign leaders “want people that are bad out” and so “what do they do? They open their jails, they let ‘em out. They get rid of their drug dealers, they let ‘em out. But you know who else they get out? The people that are on welfare that aren’t working. In other words, they have people that just don’t work. They don’t want people that just don’t work, so they put them into our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has never substantiated such claims, though he has been making them since his 2024 campaign. Experts on  international prison policy  and  crime in Venezuela  have told CNN they have seen no evidence of Venezuela or any other country emptying jails for migration purposes, let alone that these countries actively inserted former prisoners into the US.\n \n\n   \n   Migration under Biden \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his false claim that 25 million migrants were allowed into the country under Biden, though he was more tentative this time than usual, saying, “Probably, I say, 25 million people were let into our country. A lot of people say it was 10 million people. But whether it was 10 or — I believe I’m much closer to the right number. Of the 25, many of them should not be here.”\n \n\n   \n  The “25 million” figure is wildly inaccurate; even Trump’s previous “21 million” figure was a  major exaggeration . Through December 2024, the last full month under the Biden administration, the federal government had  recorded  under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during that administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country. Even adding in the so-called gotaways who evaded detection,  estimated  by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there’s no way the total was even close to Trump’s claim.\n \n\n   \n    Legal issues, impeachment and the 2020 election\n \n\n   \n   Previous presidents and the Insurrection Act \n \n\n   \n  Trump spoke of the Insurrection Act, which gives the president sweeping powers to deploy troops to US states if certain vague conditions are met, and said, “Do you know that some of the presidents, recent ones, have used it 28 times? 28 times.” No president has invoked the act on more occasions than President Ulysses S. Grant’s six (after the Civil War in the 1800s), and no president has invoked it since President George H.W. Bush in 1992, according to  research published in 2022  by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. In fact, the Insurrection Act and the similar laws that preceded it have been invoked on a  total  of 30 occasions in US history, the Brennan Center found.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also said, “Do you know how many presidents have used the Insurrection Act? Almost 50% of ‘em.” That’s at least a slight exaggeration.   Seventeen of the 45 presidents to date, so just under 38%, have invoked the act or its precursor laws, according to the Brennan Center.

He falsely  claimed in June  that it occurred  “the day before the election.”\n \n\n   \n   Trump and the Justice Department \n \n\n   \n  CBS’ O’Donnell noted  the recent indictments  of three targets of Trump criticism — former FBI Director James Comey, former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, and New York Attorney General Letitia James — and asked him whether he instructed the Justice Department to “go after them”; Trump responded, “No, and not in any way, shape or form. No.” But this is obviously false: he recently put  public  pressure on the Justice Department to go after Comey and James.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  wrote  in a September social media  post  directed to “Pam” — Attorney General Pam Bondi, the head of the Justice Department — that Comey, James and Schiff are “all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” that “we can’t delay any longer” and that “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” (Trump intended the post to be a private message to Bondi, a source familiar with the matter told CNN after The Wall Street Journal first  reported  it.) Trump did not mention Bolton in that social media post; however, it’s worth noting he  previously made public calls  for his former adviser to be imprisoned over Bolton’s alleged inclusion of classified information in a memoir.\n \n\n   \n   A false story about Democrats and Trump’s first impeachment \n \n\n   \n  Trump delivered another version of a false story he  has told since 2019  about Democrats’ response to a phone call that year in which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into Biden, who was his looming opponent in the 2020 election. This time, Trump said, “The Democrats knew that I wasn’t guilty, because they didn’t know the — the call was — I didn’t know either: The call was essentially taped. So we knew exactly what the call — when they found out that the call was taped, Nancy Pelosi went crazy. She said, ‘You made me go into this mess.’ She screamed at all these people that made her do it, bad people like (Democratic Rep. Adam) Schiff, etc., etc.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s narrative is thoroughly inaccurate.\n \n\n   \n  Pelosi could not possibly have been angry with Schiff or other allies after finding out the call was “taped” because, more than six years later, there is still no known US tape of the conversation; presidential calls with foreign leaders  are not typically recorded by the American side . In reality, the day after Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry in September 2019, Trump’s White House released a  rough written transcript  of the call. There has never been any indication that seeing the rough transcript made Pelosi feel she had been deceived into the impeachment push; the day the document was released, Pelosi issued a  scathing statement  accusing Trump of “lawlessness” and attempting “to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.” A Pelosi spokesperson told CNN in 2024 that a Trump story similar to the one he told on “60 Minutes” was “fact-free nonsense.”\n \n\n   \n   Trump and the Presidential Records Act \n \n\n   \n  Trump decried the  FBI search  of his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in 2022, during the investigation into his handling of classified documents after his presidency, and he brought back his false claim that the Presidential Records Act permitted him to possess these documents: “They took things that I was allowed to have … under the Presidential Records Act, that I was allowed to have. I had records. I was allowed to have them.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s not true. The Presidential Records Act clearly says that all presidential records belong to the federal government  the moment the president leaves office . The  key sentence  from the law is unequivocal: “Upon the conclusion of a President’s term of office, or if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.”\n \n\n   \n   Jason R. Baron , former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told CNN when Trump made such claims during the Biden administration: “Under the Presidential Records Act, not a single document pertaining to the official business of the White House — classified or unclassified — should have been carted off to Mar-A-Lago. President Trump might consider such records to be ‘his,’ but they are not.”\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean Trump committed a criminal offense; the Presidential Records Act is not a criminal statute, and Trump was charged in 2023 for  allegedly violating other laws . (A judge appointed by Trump  dismissed the case  in 2024, declaring that the appointment of the special counsel who brought the charges violated the Constitution.) But Trump was,  again , wrongly describing what the act says.\n \n\n   \n   The 2020 election \n \n\n   \n  Trump uttered his regular lie that the 2020 election “was rigged and stolen,” saying at other moments of the interview that “this was a rigged election” and that “one thing I can tell you, the 2020 election was rigged.” Trump legitimately lost a free and fair election to Biden. Trump also falsely claimed, “And it’s been caught … and you see the same information that everybody else does. And it’s coming out now in spades.” Trump didn’t explain what he was talking about, but no election-rigging or widespread fraud has “been caught.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/sport/marathon-running-global-warming-intl","dateOfPublication":"1227-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:47:00.000-05:00","title":"Why global warming could be ‘rewriting race history’ at major marathon events","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Global warming is significantly impacting marathon performance, with a new Climate Central study predicting that 86% of major marathons—including New York, London, Berlin, Tokyo, Chicago, Boston, and Sydney—will have less optimal racing conditions by 2045.

at major marathon events \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:47 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Runners already face a daunting challenge when they line up at the start of a  marathon , but they might increasingly find themselves with another obstacle to reckon with:  global warming .\n \n\n   \n  A  new study  claims that rising temperatures around the world will make it harder for elite athletes to break the marathon world record, or for recreational runners to hit their target times.\n \n\n   \n  Of the 221 races analyzed in the report from Climate Central released last week, 86% of them are less likely to have optimal racing conditions for runners by 2045.\n \n\n   \n  That includes last Sunday’s  New York City Marathon  and the other six major marathons around the world — London, Berlin, Tokyo, Chicago, Boston, and Sydney.\n \n\n   \n  For runners, the consequences of running in hot conditions can be extreme. \n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen time and time again where athletes are passing out from dehydration and heat exhaustion during races and taking months to recover,” Scottish distance runner Mhairi Maclennan told  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  “It has really significant impacts on the thickness of your blood, on how quickly your body is able to recover, on your hydration levels for days, and also your ability to train after that kind of experience, which can then delay other achievements and goals that you’re pursuing.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the study, the optimal temperature for elite male marathon runners is 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) and 48 degrees F (9 degrees Celsius) for elite women.\n \n\n   \n  This year, the Tokyo Marathon had a 69% chance of optimal race day temperatures for elite men, per the study, but those odds are expected to fall to 57% in 20 years. The Boston Marathon’s odds are expected to drop from 61% to 53% for the same category over the same time span, while London’s reduce from 22% to 17%.\n \n\n   \n  For elite women, the likelihood of optimal conditions is also anticipated to fall at five of the seven marathon majors by 2045, with the odds reduced by 10% and 11% or more at the Sydney and Berlin Marathons respectively.\n \n\n   \n  According to  data  from climate monitoring agency Copernicus, 2024 was the hottest year on record — 1.6 degrees Celsius warmer than the period before humans began burning large amounts of fossil fuels. It broke the previous record set in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Exercising in higher temperatures places  greater stress  on the body – especially in high humidity – and an athlete’s hydration strategy becomes even more crucial.\n \n\n   \n  During the Berlin Marathon in September, temperatures reached an unseasonably warm 75.2 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius), while the Tokyo and London Marathons saw temperatures rise above 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of this year’s race in Berlin, organizers  advised  that warmer temperatures would “make it harder to achieve personal bests” and told runners to “shift your focus away from chasing records and instead soak up the unique atmosphere along the course.” They also gave advice on hydration, cooling strategies, clothing and recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “Some of the exceptional heat experienced at the 2025 Berlin and Tokyo Marathons pushed temperatures far beyond peak performance conditions,” said Maclennan, who was the highest-placed British woman at last year’s London Marathon with a time of 2:29:15.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s difficult because at the end of the day, sport is a business, and it generates revenue from spectators, and if spectators are there to see fast performances and that’s not happening because of climate change, that’s an issue for the sector.”\n \n\n   \n  Maclennan, who lives and trains in the often cold climes of Scotland, said that running in the heat “has and always will be a challenge for me.” She explained how elite athletes competing in hot conditions might undertake warm weather training camps, do workouts in heat chambers, or take saunas and hot baths straight after training to keep the body temperature high for longer periods.\n \n\n   \n  After heavy rain and flooding in New York City last week, the conditions were good for Sunday’s race, with more than 55,000 runners taking part. But should major marathons continue to take place in warm weather, then it might create a scheduling headache for organizers.\n \n\n   \n  “We have marathons in the spring and in the autumn in the northern hemisphere, because those are the times when we get the good, cool temperatures that you need for good running performance,” Andrew Pershing, who leads the Climate Central science team and worked on the new study, told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “As the climate warms, if you have a race that happens at the same week every year, that good climate is moving past you and it’s moving away. Those good conditions are becoming less and less frequent.”\n \n\n   \n  One solution for organizers might be to schedule earlier start time for races.\n \n\n   \n  An extreme example of that was the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha, when the men’s and women’s marathons began at midnight local time to compensate for hot weather during the day. But even then, temperatures for the women’s race reached 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius) with humidity at 77%.\n \n\n   \n  As Maclennan explained, athletes rarely have the luxury to choose when and where they compete, especially around events like the world championships and marathon majors.\n \n\n   \n  The 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, she said, might be another instance where athletes “probably have to do a lot of acclimatization,” adding: “The same is true for any competition where the environment is different to what you train in. There is consideration to be made into how you adapt and how you train your body to compete in those conditions.”\n \n\n   \n  The marathon world record has been broken several times on both the men’s and women’s side in recent years, though many attribute the faster times to advancements in  shoe technology .\n \n\n   \n   Ruth Chepngetich , who is currently serving a three-year doping ban, set the women’s record of 2:09:56 in Chicago last year, while the late  Kelvin Kiptum  set the men’s mark of 2:00:35 in 2023, also in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  But with global temperatures rising, athletes and climate experts alike anticipate that those kinds of performances might become more scarce in the future.\n \n\n   \n  “There are more marathons with worsening conditions, which is decreasing the overall opportunities for elite women to potentially break records,” said Maclennan. “Overall, that, I guess, reduces the quality of the product … I do think that heat waves are already rewriting race history.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/uk/uk-train-attack-wwk-intl-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:19:00.000Z","title":"British man charged over mass stabbing attack on a train in England","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A British man, Anthony Williams, 32, from Peterborough, has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm, and one count of possession of a bladed article, following a mass stabbing attack on a London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train near Peterborough on Saturday evening.

One of those included a stabbing in Peterborough city center, in which a 14-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive but previously said that there was no evidence to suggest the attacks were terror-related.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the stabbing on the train.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train departed from the northern city of Doncaster at 6:25 p.m. local time on Saturday, bound for London.\n \n\n   \n  The train had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place.\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  After seeing more people running past, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get (as) far down the train as they can.”\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train restrooms, said other witnesses who saw train seats soaked in blood.\n \n\n   \n  Cambridgeshire police received their first emergency call at approximately 7:39 p.m. local time and immediately deployed armed officers. Within about 11 minutes of the call, two initial suspects were arrested after the train made an unplanned stop at Huntingdon station. One of those suspects was later released.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  The train remained at Huntingdon station Sunday morning, with medical equipment and other debris seen strewn on the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Police had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before rescinding it later.\n \n\n   \n  “Our investigation is also looking at other possible linked offences,” Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Cundy of the British Transport Police said in a statement Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Williams was charged with another count of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article in connection to another incident on Saturday at Pontoon Dock station in London, which is about 100 miles from Peterborough.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday said the suspect was not known to security services, counter-terror police or the Home Office’s Prevent program, a central plank of Britain’s strategy to combat terrorism.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the victims?\n \n\n   \n  A total of 11 victims received treatment in hospital. Ten people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, nine of whom were in life-threatening condition, while another person later self-presented that evening.\n \n\n   \n  As of Sunday evening, one person remains in hospital in life-threatening condition, BTP said. The man, an LNER staff member who was on the train, had “tried to stop the attacker,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  “Detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood paid tribute to the worker, saying that he “ran toward danger, confronting the attacker for a sustained period of time, and stopped his advance through the train.”\n \n\n   \n  Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said on Monday that five people were still in the hospital, including the train crew member who is in a “critical but stable condition.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the victims still in the hospital is Scunthorpe United player Jonathan Gjoshe, the soccer club said in a statement, which said he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about other victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n  Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding.\n \n\n   \n    How common are such attacks in the UK?\n \n\n   \n  The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, knife crime has risen overall since 2011. Some 51,527 knife crime offenses were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Of those, 15,689 were recorded in London.\n \n\n   \n  British politicians and other key figures expressed their shock at Saturday’s attack and offered their condolences to victims.\n \n\n   \n  “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” Starmer wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line – on which the train was traveling – is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/style/sequin-dresses-lacma-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:19:00-05:00","title":"Look of the Week: The humble sequin dress is fashion’s great equalizer","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the sequin dress as a symbol of fashion’s democratization, highlighting its historical roots in ancient Egypt and early modern Europe as a marker of wealth and security.

    12:19 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sequins? In November? Groundbreaking. Yes, when Salma Hayek, Doja Cat, Iris Law, Angela Bassett, Alex Consani, Emma Roberts, Vittoria Cerretti, Demi Moore, Kaia Gerber and her supermodel mother Cindy Crawford arrived at the LACMA Art+Film Gala on Saturday, each wearing a glitzy dress by Gucci — the official sponsor of the gala — it did for a moment feel like the label had made the most out of a closing down sale at the sequin wholesaler.\n \n\n   \n  But don’t write off this partywear trope too soon. It really is fashion’s great equalizer. Affordable, accessible and offered by many mass market brands — most women will have worn a sequin look in their life. Whether you dutifully fish your favorite out for an evening occasion this side of daylight savings, or just have fond memories wearing one on birthdays, holiday office parties or New Year’s Eve countdown’s gone by, there is something familiar about the high-shine iridescence of a sequin-covered frock that we can all relate to. That’s what makes it so endearing to see them on the 1% at red carpets.\n \n\n   \n  They were, however, once markers of extreme luxury. The first ‘sequin’ dates back to ancient Egypt, found by archeologists in Tutankhamun’s tomb around 1922. Small nuggets of gold had been hammered into round disks and sewn onto King Tut’s clothes to enable him to carry some of his wealth into the afterlife. In fact, most early sequins were sewn-on coins. Along with signalling affluence, clothes became wearable purses for travelers and attaching ones coins to a vest instead of carrying a bag was an easy way to avoid theft. Over the centuries, the gesture became more decorative and less about corporeal money management. A  portrait from 1620  of a well-to-do English woman named Margaret Layton, for example, shows her dressed in a dazzling embroidered jacket flecked with thousands of small sequins made from silver, gold and copper alloy. While it wasn’t the gold coins of King Tut, these precious metals feel unrecognizable compared to the shiny plastic disks we know today.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, the price tag of a Gucci sequin gown will probably bear more resemblance to Layton’s alloy embellished jacket. But at least these red carpet looks can be readily recreated at home. One complaint often leveled at luxury fashion is that it’s inaccessible, particularly in recent years: Prices were once aspirational, now they are  astronomical . Some designs, too, have been rooted in fantasy, as designers propose their wildest and most uninhibited visions on the catwalk. Sometimes, these ideas are diluted and trickle down into the prevailing trends of the day. Other times, they leave those outside the industry bubble feeling cold.\n \n\n   \n  But the sequin dress is easy-to-digest glamour. It’s simple yet effective, and pleasantly humble while still demanding attention. Plus, not every event requires 30,000  hand-embellished Swarovski crystals , or a one-of-a-kind archival designer gown. Sometimes all you really need, as Gucci reminded us, is a grab-and-go glittery frock that will do the work for you.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/europe/drones-spotted-belgian-airbase-spying-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:18:00-05:00","title":"Drones spotted above Belgian airbase were ‘spying’ on military planes, defense minister says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Several drones were spotted above the Kleine-Brogel Air Base in Belgium, where the Belgian defense minister, Theo Francken, stated they were conducting surveillance on military assets, including F-16 fighter jets and munitions.

By 7:50 p.m., officers had arrested the 32-year-old British suspect on the platform at Huntingdon station, police told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The critically injured train worker has not yet been publicly identified.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday paid tribute to the worker, saying that they “ran toward danger, confronting the attacker for a sustained period of time, and stopped his advance through the train.”\n \n\n   \n  British Transport Police (BTP) said that “detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives.”\n \n\n   \n  “The bravery that he showed was utterly remarkable… he put himself in harm’s way,” British Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told the BBC on Monday. “There are people who are alive today who wouldn’t be alive had it not been for his actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Five other casualties have now been discharged from hospital, BTP said in an update on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander also paid tribute to emergency services and, in particular, the train driver, “who had the presence of mind to phone the signals in Network Rail and get the train onto that slow line into Huntingdon station and a place of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed train was scheduled to pass through the station on a fast line, but driver and signalers quickly arranged for it to divert onto a slow track so it could stop alongside the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Open-source data shows that a signaler made the first alteration to the train’s planned route at 7:40 p.m. local time – only one minute after police received the first call about the attack. Another local train was already at the platform at Huntingdon – once it had left, the signaler was able to guide the LNER train safely into the platform where it stopped by 7:44 p.m.\n \n\n   \n  Huntington station happens to be around the corner from the Cambridgeshire Constabulary police headquarters, and both response officers and armed officers were quickly on the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, the UK’s PA Media news agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Train driver Andrew Johnson told ITV News: “I was only doing my job. It was my colleague who is in hospital who was the brave one.” Johnson, from Peterborough, is reported by British media to have served in the Royal Navy for 17 years.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has been praised for remaining calm as the attack unfolded and choosing not to make an emergency stop between stations, where it would have been more difficult for authorities to respond. Instead, the swift decisions by Johnson and the signaler enabled the train to be stopped at Huntingdon; the next opportunity would have been a station seven minutes further down the line.\n \n\n   \n  Train drivers in the United Kingdom have extensive route training and are required to know the location of every signal and track layout on their route, including in the dark. Signalers have similar detailed knowledge.\n \n\n   \n  Nigel Roebuck, an organizer for the train drivers’ union ASLEF and a lead officer with LNER, told British media that “the driver did everything he was trained to do, at the right time and in the right way.”\n \n\n   \n  “He showed real courage, real dedication, and real determination in the most difficult of circumstances,” Roebuck added. “Our thoughts tonight are with his colleague who is still in intensive care.”\n \n\n   \n    Suspect charged with multiple attempted murders\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive for the attack but said that there was no evidence to suggest it was terror related. Mahmood said the suspect was not known to security services, counter-terror police or the Home Office’s Prevent program, a central plank of Britain’s strategy to combat terrorism.\n \n\n   \n  The man apprehended, Anthony Williams, 32, of Peterborough, was charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of bladed article. He was also charged with another count of attempted murder in connection with an incident that happened earlier on Saturday at a station in London. Williams was remanded in custody after appearing in court on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  While in court, he wasn’t asked to enter pleas and he said “no fixed abode” when he was asked about his address, according to the UK’s PA Media. His next appearance in court is due to be on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  A second man was initially arrested at the scene, but he was later released without charge.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, three more incidents believed to be linked to the attacker took place in Peterborough on Friday evening and Saturday morning, according to Cambridgeshire police. One of those included a stabbing in Peterborough city center, in which a 14-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n    Witnesses describe running from attack\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  At first she thought it was a Halloween prank, but it became clear it was a genuine attack when the man shouted that someone had a knife and more people came running down the train.\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train restrooms, said other witnesses. Other passengers were able to hide themselves in the train’s buffet carriage.\n \n\n   \n  Another witness, Thomas McLachlan, told the BBC: “There were definitely many heroes on that day, many kind people who just wanted to help those around them – people handing out blankets, hand warmers.”\n \n\n   \n  McLachlan said he saw one injured man who had been slashed in the face. He and another witness told local media that he heard the man had been “trying to protect a young girl from being attacked” when he was stabbed.\n \n\n   \n  One of the victims still in the hospital is Scunthorpe United player Jonathan Gjoshe, the soccer club said in a statement, which said he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about other victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n  LNER managing director David Horne said in a statement that he would like to recognize the “driver, crew and our operational response colleagues for their bravery and quick actions.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Sophie Tanno and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/africa/trump-christian-killings-nigeria-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00-04:00","title":"The violence in Nigeria that Trump cites as a reason for military strikes is not limited to Christians","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked international concern by suggesting military intervention in Nigeria over claims of a mass slaughter of Christians by Islamist insurgents, particularly Boko Haram.

11:45 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump caused alarm across Nigeria over the weekend when he said he was contemplating military action in Africa’s most populous nation in response to what he claimed was a “mass slaughter” of Christians by Islamist insurgents.\n \n\n   \n  The reality on the ground, experts and analysts say, is a more complex and nuanced one. Both Christians and Muslims — the two main religious groups in the country of more than 230 million people — have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists, they say.\n \n\n   \n  The West African nation has grappled for years with deep-rooted security problems that are driven by various factors, including religiously motivated attacks. Observers say other violent conflicts arise from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to land and water resources.\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government rejects claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence, saying it was bewildered by Trump’s suggestion of a potential military intervention.\n \n\n   \n  “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, Trump threatened to stop all US aid to Nigeria if its government fails to take steps to stop the killings of Christians. He warned that the proposed intervention would be “fast and vicious,” aimed at eliminating the “Islamic Terrorists” he said were responsible for these atrocities.\n \n\n   \n    Is Trump correct about a mass slaughter of Christians in Nigeria?\n \n\n   \n  As Trump’s war threats echo among Nigerians, his assertion that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” has provoked strong reactions from many within the country.\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria has nearly equal numbers of Christians and Muslims, with the northern region predominantly Muslim and the southern region largely Christian.\n \n\n   \n  In 2012, the Islamist group Boko Haram  issued an ultimatum , ordering Christians in the northern region to leave while calling on Muslims in the south to “come back” to the north.\n \n\n   \n  John Joseph Hayab, a pastor who leads the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the country’s northern region, where attacks by Islamist groups are prevalent, told CNN that he agrees with Trump’s claim of “systematic killings of Christians” in that area. However, he added, “there has been a little shift in the last two years,” with the scale of the killings reducing.\n \n\n   \n  Hayab said he had presided over numerous mass burials of slain Christians, stating that “every state in northern Nigeria has suffered its own terrible share of killings targeting Christians.”\n \n\n   \n  He urged the Nigerian government to acknowledge the issue and take measures to correct the killings rather than deny them.\n \n\n   \n  “We have raised this matter dozens of times, but nobody hears us,” he claimed, acknowledging the role of US Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in bringing attention to reports of alleged Christian persecution in Nigeria.\n \n\n   \n  In August, the Republican senator  introduced a bill  calling for sanctions against Nigeria for purported violations of religious freedom.\n \n\n   \n  Some analysts argue that while Christians have been targeted by Boko Haram and other Islamist groups seeking to impose their extreme interpretation of Islamic law, Muslims, including those considered moderate, have also been victims of those groups.\n \n\n   \n  Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian human rights advocate specializing in security and development, disputed Trump’s comments, telling CNN that they “reflect a dangerous oversimplification of Nigeria’s complex security crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  He stated: “The claim that there is a ‘mass slaughter of Christians’ by ‘Islamic radicals’ distorts the reality on the ground and risks deepening divisions in a country already under immense strain.”\n \n\n   \n    High profile killings in predominantly Christian areas draw international attention\n \n\n   \n  Northern Nigeria has witnessed horrific killings targeting religious groups this year. In April, gunmen believed to be Muslim herders,  killed at least 40 people , including children, in a predominantly Christian farming village, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  Two months later, more than 100 people were massacred by attackers in Yelwata, a largely Christian community in Benue state, also in the north-central,  according  to Amnesty International.\n \n\n   \n  Pope Leo XIV offered prayers for the victims of the Yelwata attack, many of whom were “internally displaced persons sheltered by a local Catholic mission,” a  Vatican news report  said.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the northern region, such targeted killings are rare. A  a mass shooting at a church in Owo , a community in southwestern Nigeria, left dozens dead in 2022. Court filings  seen by Reuters  linked the suspects in the Owo massacre to al-Shabaab, a militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda operating in East Africa.\n \n\n   \n  Muslims have also been victims of targeted killings this year. In August,  at least 50 worshippers were killed  — some shot, others burned alive — when gunmen attacked a mosque in the north-western Katsina State, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  Many similarly brutal attacks have been carried out in Muslim communities by Boko Haram and other armed groups in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, these (extremist) groups have sadly killed many Christians. However, they have also massacred tens of thousands of Muslims,” Bukarti said. He noted that “the groups’ attacks on other civilian locations such as markets, bus stops and refugee camps (disproportionately) harm Muslims,” as the states where the radical groups operate are predominantly Muslim.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Trump’s rhetoric (suggesting a mass slaughter of Christians) not only misinforms the international community but also risks fuelling extremist propaganda and undermining local efforts to build peace,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    What does the data reveal?\n \n\n   \n  Claims that Christians are being disproportionately targeted by extremists in Nigeria are not supported by what little data is available.\n \n\n   \n  Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, a crisis-monitoring group,  reported  that more than 20,400 civilians were killed in attacks in Nigeria between January 2020 and September of this year. Among those casualties, 317 deaths were attributed to attacks targeting Christians, while 417 deaths were reported among Muslims, though the organization did not include the religious affiliation of the vast majority of the civilians killed.\n \n\n   \n  Security analyst Nnamdi Obasi, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, explained that while extremist groups have wreaked havoc against both Christians and Muslims in the northeast of Nigeria, bandit groups have terrorized predominantly Muslim communities in the northwest. Additionally, predominantly Christian farming communities in parts of the North Central zone have suffered persistent violence from armed groups.\n \n\n   \n  However, “in most parts of the country, Christians and Muslims live peacefully with each other,” he said. “Reports of widespread persecution and mass slaughter of Christians are seriously misread and exaggerate the challenges of interfaith relations in the country.”\n \n\n   \n  Ken Eluma Asogwa, a spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, told CNN that “even though the government of Nigeria has been lackluster and shambolic in its approach to the protection of its citizens from murderous non-state actors operating under different aliases, there is no evidence to support Trump’s claims that Christians are particularly targeted for extermination.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump designated Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” under the US  International Religious Freedom Act . The label is a suggestion that his administration has found that Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has so far remained silent about Trump’s mention of potential military intervention but pushed back against the designation, stating in a social media  post  that “the characterization of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.”\n \n\n   \n    Would US military action be likely to stop the killings?\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not ruled out the possibility of sending US troops to Nigeria or launching airstrikes in the country, telling reporters on Sunday, “I envisage a lot of things.”\n \n\n   \n  But analyst Obasi said that any unilateral US military operation against Islamist groups in Nigeria would not address the underlying factors driving instability there.\n \n\n   \n  Such an intervention, he said, “without the involvement of Nigerian security forces, would be predictably unwelcome by many Nigerians and could further destabilize the country, aggravating its security situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Instead, he urged the Nigerian government to “intensify efforts to end the mass killings of citizens,” regardless of their religious or other identities, and to address religious extremism, tensions over resources and banditry, “which are the underlying drivers of most of the mass killings.”\n \n\n   \n  Bulama, the human rights advocate, believes the Nigerian government can address Trump’s criticism by “moving beyond defensiveness.”\n \n\n   \n  “It should meet misinformation with data,” he suggested, adding that “this moment calls for candor, not posturing.”\n \n\n   \n  “Constructive dialogue, not social-media outrage, will best serve Nigeria’s interests — and the cause of peace,” he advised.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/state-medicaid-undocumented-immigrants-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:39:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s HHS Orders States to Investigate Medicaid Enrollees for Immigration Status","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has ordered state Medicaid programs to verify the immigration status of enrollees, leading to over 170,000 names being reviewed across five states and Washington, D.C.

But the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz, said in a post on the social platform X on Oct. 31 that more than $1 billion “of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants” in five states and Washington, D.C.\n \n\n   \n  Medicaid’s overall spending topped $900 billion in fiscal year 2024.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t clear from Oz’s statement or an accompanying video over what period the spending happened, and CMS spokespeople did not immediately respond to questions, either for an earlier version of this article or after Oz’s statement was posted.\n \n\n   \n  Only U.S. citizens and some lawfully present immigrants are eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income and disabled people, and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program. Those without legal status are ineligible for federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, and plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Several states disputed Oz’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Our payments for coverage of undocumented individuals are in accordance with state and federal laws,” said Marc Williams, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Department of Health Care Policy & Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program. “The $1.5 million number referenced by federal leaders today is based on an incorrect preliminary finding, and has been refuted with supporting data by our Department experts.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “It is disappointing that the administration is announcing this number as final when it is clearly overstated and the conversations are very much in the education and discussion phase.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Medicaid officials blasted Oz’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Once again, the Trump administration is spreading misinformation about standard uses of Medicaid dollars,” said Illinois Medicaid spokesperson Melissa Kula. “This is not a reality show, and there is no conspiracy to circumvent federal law and provide ineligible individuals with Medicaid coverage. Dr. Oz should stop pushing conspiracy theories and focus on improving health care for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  The Washington State Health Care Authority, which runs the state’s Medicaid program, was also blunt.\n \n\n   \n  “The numbers Dr. Oz posted on social media today are inaccurate,” said spokesperson Rachelle Alongi. “We were very surprised to see Dr. Oz’s post, especially considering we continue to work with CMS in good faith to answer their questions and clear up any confusion.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, CMS began sending states the names of people enrolled in Medicaid that the agency suspected might not be eligible, demanding state Medicaid agencies check their immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News in October reached out to Medicaid agencies in 10 states. Five provided the approximate number of names they had received from the Trump administration, with expectations of more to come: Colorado had been given about 45,000 names, Ohio 61,000, Pennsylvania 34,000, Texas 28,000, and Utah 8,000. More than 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  Most of those states declined to comment further. Medicaid agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and South Carolina refused to say how many names they were ordered to review or did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said in his X post that California had misspent $1.3 billion on care for people not eligible for Medicaid, while Illinois spent $30 million, Oregon $5.4 million, Washington state $2.4 million, Washington, D.C., $2.1 million, and Colorado $1.5 million.\n \n\n   \n  “We notified the states, and many have begun refunding the money,” he said. “But what if we had never asked?”\n \n\n   \n  Washington, D.C.’s Medicaid director, Melisa Byrd, said CMS had identified administrative expenses for the district program that covers people regardless of immigration status that should not have been billed to the federal government and her agency has already fixed some of those areas. “We run a big program that is very complex and when mistakes or errors happen, we fix them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The program plans to pay $654,014 back to CMS by mid-November.\n \n\n   \n  All five states, plus Washington, D.C., are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump didn’t win any of them in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill  began posting pictures  on X of people he said are convicted criminals living in the U.S. without authorization who had received Medicaid benefits.\n \n\n   \n  O’Neill could not be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “We are very concerned because this seems, frankly, to be a waste of state resources and furthers the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior health advocacy strategist with the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. “This duplicates what states already do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the administration’s crackdown on people in the U.S. without authorization, President Donald Trump in February directed federal agencies to take action to ensure they are not obtaining benefits in violation of federal law.\n \n\n   \n  In June, advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered CMS to share information about Medicaid enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security, drawing a lawsuit by some states alarmed that the administration would use the information for its deportation campaign against unauthorized residents.\n \n\n   \n  In August, a federal judge ordered HHS to  stop sharing the information  with immigration authorities.\n \n\n   \n  State Medicaid agencies use databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify enrollees’ immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  If states need to go back to individuals to reverify their citizenship or immigration status, it could lead some to fall off the rolls unnecessarily — for example, if they don’t see a letter requesting paperwork or fail to meet a deadline to respond.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not sure that evidence suggests there really is a need for this” extra verification, said Marian Jarlenski, a health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.\n \n\n   \n  Oz made clear that the Trump administration disagrees.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether willful or not, the states’ conduct highlights a terrifying reality: American taxpayers have been footing the bill for illegal immigrants’ Medicaid coverage, despite many Democrats and the media insisting otherwise,” Oz said in his X post.\n \n\n   \n  In an August press release, CMS said it would ask states to verify eligibility for enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases. “We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, called the CMS order to states “unprecedented” in the Medicaid program’s 60-year history.\n \n\n   \n  He said the federal government may have been unable to verify certain individuals’ immigration status because names were misspelled or outdated, such as when a beneficiary is identified by their maiden instead of married name. The names may also include people helped by Emergency Medicaid, a program that covers the cost of hospital emergency services, including labor and delivery, for people regardless of immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS is conducting pointless immigration status reviews for people whose hospital bills were paid by Emergency Medicaid,” Cuello said.\n \n\n   \n  Oz noted in his post that federal law “does permit states to use Medicaid dollars for emergency treatment, regardless of patients’ citizenship or immigration status,” and that states can “legally build Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants using their own state tax dollars, so long as no federal tax dollars are used.”\n \n\n   \n  The states Oz mentioned all  run their own  such programs.\n \n\n   \n  The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July. The measure, which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, makes many changes to Medicaid, including adding a work requirement in most states starting by 2027. The law also requires most states to more frequently check the eligibility of many adult Medicaid enrollees — at least twice a year.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear states may do unnecessary checks that create a burden for some enrollees who will lose health coverage who should not,” Cuello said. “It’s going to be a whole lot of work for CMS and states for very little pay dirt.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuello said the effort may have “greater political value than actual value.”\n \n\n   \n  Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid in the state, said the state already requires every Medicaid applicant to verify their citizenship or, where applicable, their eligible immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  However, he said, the directive issued by CMS “constitutes a new process, and DHS is carefully reviewing the list in order to take appropriate actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Oz did not name Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2024, in his post.\n \n\n   \n  If a lawful resident does not have a Social Security number, the state confirms their legal status by checking a database from Homeland Security, as well as verifying specific immigration documents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our teams just received this notice and are working through a process by which we will perform these reviews,” Jennifer Strohecker, then Utah’s Medicaid director, told a state advisory board in August.\n \n\n   \n   Renuka Rayasam and Rae Ellen Bichell contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/asia/northern-afghanistan-earthquake-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:47:00.000-05:00","title":"Deadly quake rocks Afghanistan leaving iconic Blue Mosque surrounded by rubble","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck northern Afghanistan near Mazar-i-Sharif on November 3, 2025, killing at least 20 people and injuring over 600 across several provinces.

CNN\n \n   \n  A powerful earthquake has rattled northern Afghanistan, killing more than a dozen people, injuring hundreds and damaging one the country’s most beautiful mosques.\n \n\n   \n  Families were jolted awake in the early hours of Monday when the 6.3-magnitude quake struck near Mazar-i-Sharif, one of the most populated cities in the north of the country, at a shallow depth of 28 kilometers (17.4 miles), the  United States Geological Survey  said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive search and rescue operation is underway, with a child seen pulled alive from the rubble in the north of the country in video released by the Ministry of Defense on Monday morning. The girl was taken to hospital in a critical condition, a spokesperson for the 209 Al-Fath Army Corp told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mazar-i-Sharif’s iconic Blue Mosque was damaged in the quake, footage on social media geolocated by CNN revealed, with its base littered with rubble - early evidence of the destruction captured in the shadows before dawn.\n \n\n   \n  The site is one of Afghanistan’s architectural treasures and a major point of pilgrimage, believed by some to be the resting place of Hazrat Ali, the fourth Caliph of Islam and the son-in-law of Prophet Mohammad.\n \n\n   \n  Residents in at least nine provinces, including Kabul, lost power after electricity lines from Uzbekistan – a major supplier of power to Afghanistan – were severed.\n \n\n   \n  The state-run energy company DABS also reported cut lines from Tajikistan to Kunduz province, plunging the area into total blackout. Teams are “working urgently to restore both routes,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Government officials put the death toll at 20 with more than 600 people injured across the Samangan, Balkh, Sar-e-Pul, Kunduz and Jawzjan provinces, in an update on Monday afternoon. The Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority also suggested casualties could rise further as “search and rescue operations are still ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  The National Authority for Disaster Preparedness said the quake struck at around 1 a.m. local time, impacting parts of the north, east and west, with the epicenter located in Samangan.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations confirmed it has teams on the ground “to assess needs and deliver urgent aid.”\n \n\n   \n  India also offered support in the wake of the earthquake, according to a post from foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on X. He wrote, “Indian relief material for the earthquake impacted communities is being handed over today. Further supplies of medicines to reach soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Afghanistan has endured a series of earthquake in recent years that have caused thousands of deaths and the USGS models estimate the shaking from Monday’s quake could result in hundreds of fatalities.\n \n\n   \n  The impoverished country’s ability to respond to natural disasters has been further impeded by a shortage in international aid following the Taliban’s successful takeover in the wake of the  chaotic withdrawal of US-led forces  in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Damage to properties was also reported in the affected areas, the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority said, with accounts of broken windows and structural damage to homes.\n \n\n   \n  One resident of Mazar-i-Sharif told CNN that her family “woke up terrified” after the quake struck, saying that her children ran “down the stairs screaming” when it occurred.\n \n\n   \n  “I had never experienced such a strong earthquake in my life,” said Rahima, a former school teacher, 50, adding that it broke some of her windows and damaged the plaster on some of her walls.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy that my house is made of concrete in the city,” she told CNN. “I don’t know if houses made of mud have survived this earthquake in the outskirts of the city.”\n \n\n   \n  The quake also blocked the Tashqurghan passage, a critical route from the capital of Kabul towards neighboring Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, but rescue teams have since cleared the route, the Ministry of Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  In Tashqurghan district, rubble and debris can be seen strewn across roads as bodies are carried away following the quake, according to footage from state broadcaster Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA). In another clip from RTA, people can be seen carefully making their way through the debris, scanning the ground with flashlights, with wrecked vehicles nearby.\n \n\n   \n  The earthquake was felt in regions of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, three countries that border northern Afghanistan, USGS reported.\n \n\n   \n  Back in August, at least 2,200 people were killed and thousands more were injured after a  6.0-magnitude quake  caused widespread damage along a mountainous stretch of provinces in eastern Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  The region was hit by at least five aftershocks, the strongest measuring 5.2 magnitude in the hours after the initial quake, according to USGS.\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children, which has also deployed a team to the area, said while the scale of the destruction will take time to clarify, the impact on children’s mental health was immediate.\n \n\n   \n  “This is tragically the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit Afghanistan. As temperatures fall, thousands of children in the earthquake-devastated east of the country are facing the winter with only tents for protection from the rain and snow,” said Samira Sayed Rahman, the organization’s programme development and advocacy director for Afghanistan. “Now, families in the north are also experiencing fear and uncertainty after this latest powerful quake.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2023, another  6.3-magnitude earthquake  took place in western Afghanistan, killing more than 2,000.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/climate/antarctic-glacier-hektoria-rapid-melt-sea-level","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:05:00.000-05:00","title":"Antarctic glacier saw the fastest retreat in modern history; it could spell trouble for sea levels, report finds","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in Nature Geoscience reports that the Hektoria Glacier on the Antarctic Peninsula retreated by 5 miles — nearly 50% in just two months between November and December 2022, the fastest such retreat ever recorded in modern history.

history; it could spell trouble for sea levels, report finds \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:05 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An  Antarctic glacier  shrunk by nearly 50% in just two months, the fastest retreat recorded in modern history, according to a new study — and the way it retreated could have big implications for  global sea level rise .\n \n\n   \n  The Hektoria Glacier, roughly the size of Philadelphia, is on the Antarctic Peninsula, a spindly chain of mountains sticking off the continent like a thumb pointing toward South America. It is  one of the fastest warming regions  on Earth.\n \n\n   \n  Grounded glaciers like Hektoria, which rest on the seabed and don’t float, generally retreat no more than a few hundred meters a year. But between November and December 2022, Hektoria   retreated by 5 miles, according to the  study  published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience.\n \n\n   \n  “This is astonishing; the rate of retreat is just crazy,” said Ted Scambos, a study author and senior research scientist for the Earth Science and Observation Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n \n\n   \n  Understanding more about why this happened is vital; if larger glaciers retreat at similar rates, it could have “catastrophic implications for sea level rise,” the authors wrote in a statement accompanying the report. Antarctica holds enough ice to raise   global sea level by  around 190 feet .\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria’s near demise was discovered by chance. Researchers had been surveying the bay where it’s located for a separate study. They were keeping a close eye on the area’s “fast ice” — sea ice fastened to land that doesn’t move with the wind or tides — believing it was about to break off and float out to sea.\n \n\n   \n  As Naomi Ochwat, a study co-author and postdoctoral associate at the University of Colorado Boulder, pored over the data, she noticed Hektoria had lost an enormous amount of ice over a very short period. “I realized that, OK, something special is going on here,” Ochwat told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She and her co-authors started to dig into what was happening, looking at satellite images and data from flyovers.\n \n\n   \n  They identified several steps that led﻿   to Hektoria’s rapid retreat. In 2011, the bay filled with fast ice, stabilizing the glaciers around it, allowing them to advance into the bay and form thick, floating ice tongues. In 2022, this fast ice broke out of the bay, destabilizing the glaciers, causing them to lose their ice tongues and retreat.\n \n\n   \n  The reason Hektoria fell apart much faster than its neighboring glaciers is due to what lies beneath it, the scientists found.\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria rests on an ice plain, where sliding ice glides over flat sediment on the seabed. Ice plains can prompt fast retreat because as the glacier thins, the ice starts to rise up and water pushes underneath into its crevasses, exerting pressure and causing large slabs to break off — in a process called calving.\n \n\n   \n  As one iceberg calves, it exposes the glacier behind it to the same pressures and calving happens again. Scambos likens the process to “dominoes toppling backwards, their feet slipping out from under them, one after the other.”\n \n\n   \n  This kind of ice plain melting has happened before. Models show that between about 15,000 and 19,000 years ago, during a period of warming that ended the last Ice Age, glaciers with ice plains retreated hundreds of meters a day. But “we hadn’t seen it play out live before, certainly not at this rate,” Ochwat said.\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria’s retreat   was heavily influenced by climate change, she added. The loss of sea ice in the ocean next to Hektoria, believed to have been driven by ocean warmth,   allowed wave swells to reach the fast ice and break it up, leaving the glacier exposed to ocean forces.\n \n\n   \n  As climate change accelerates, “we are likely to see more reductions of sea ice in this region,” said Bethan Davies, a glacial geologist at Newcastle University who was not involved in the study. This could result in other glaciers losing the sea ice that currently buttresses them, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria is a relatively small glacier by Antarctic standards, and its partial demise won’t cost the planet much in terms of sea level rise, Scambos said.\n \n\n   \n  However, “it’s a smaller cousin to some truly gigantic — I mean size of the island of Britain — glaciers in Antarctica that could conceivably go through the same process, as this whole evolution of the ice sheets on Earth evolves with global warming,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The next stage is to better establish which areas in Antarctica are vulnerable to the same process. If a huge glacier were to disintegrate quickly, “it means that we might have a step   change in sea level rise,” Ochwat said.\n \n\n   \n  Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the research, said the new findings “raise the bar on our understanding of how fast Antarctic glaciers may retreat.”\n \n\n   \n  These glaciers, especially the cavities beneath their ice shelves and tongues, are some of the most inaccessible environments on Earth, he told CNN, but knowing more about them is crucial to better project how they’ll respond to climate change. The research raises fears that ice loss from Antarctica, which contributes to sea-level rise, “could occur more rapidly than projected,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s yet another sign humanity still has a lot to learn about this vast, isolated continent. “We’re in a position where we’re still uncovering processes that we didn’t know about,” Ochwat said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/china-nexperia-chip-exports","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:19:00-05:00","title":"China backs off chip export ban that could have shut down global auto plants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China reversed its export ban on critical automotive chips supplied by Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor company, after pressure from the US and diplomatic talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

It’s a critical supplier for the global auto industry, providing 40% of the automotive chips in the market segment that includes transistors and diodes, according to research firm TechInsights.\n \n\n   \n  After the Dutch government  took control  of Nexperia several weeks ago and removed its Chinese CEO, citing national security concerns, Beijing suspended shipments from China.

That could drive up  car prices , as happened in the years following the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that “The Dutch government’s inappropriate interference in the company’s internal affairs has led to the current chaos in the global supply chain.”\n \n\n   \n  But after US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping  met last week , Beijing said it would allow customers to apply for exemptions from a recently imposed export control and get the chips they need.\n \n\n   \n  “As a responsible major country, China fully considers the security and stability of domestic and international supply chains,” according to a statement Saturday from China’s Ministry of Commerce. “We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of the companies and grant exemptions to eligible exports.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dutch government  took control  of Nexperia last month under pressure from the US government, which had placed its Chinese parent company, Wingtech, on a blacklist of companies it saw as posing a national security threat.

Those requests featured complaints of improper handling of ballots and other purported election irregularities as opposed to potential breaches of the Voting Rights Act.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ officials insist that monitors are being sent out in normal order.\n \n\n   \n     Who, and what, are federal election monitors? \n \n\n   \n  Federal election monitors are lawyers who work for the Justice Department, typically either in its Civil Rights Division or in local US attorneys’ offices. They are not law enforcement officers or federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  The monitors are tasked with making sure that federal voting rights laws are being followed, including the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits intimidation and threats against those who are casting ballots or counting votes, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates that election officials ensure people with disabilities have the full and equal opportunity to vote.\n \n\n   \n  While they may sound imposing, federal monitors are not there to enforce laws. Monitors are allowed only to observe and take notes. They can’t talk to voters or poll workers, don’t have access to voting machines or ballots and are not involved in tallying votes.\n \n\n   \n  The monitors typically remain outside polling places and enter only with permission from local election officials.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re not to become part of the story. You’re not even supposed to fix problems,” David Becker, a former Department of Justice voting rights attorney who now runs the Center for Election Innovation & Research, told CNN. “You’re just supposed to take notes.”\n \n\n   \n  Voters may not even be aware that federal monitors are present, Becker said, noting that political parties and individual campaigns often send their own monitors as well.\n \n\n   \n  During the 2024 presidential election, monitors were sent to 27 states. For the 2022 midterms, the DOJ monitors were in 24 states. And in 2020, during President Donald Trump’s first term, the department sent monitors to 18 states.\n \n\n   \n     Why are people concerned this year? \n \n\n   \n  While the dispatching of federal election monitors is routine, their targets this year have amplified concerns from critics who say the Justice Department is using federal law to promote Trump’s personal agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Becker, who was a federal monitor during several elections, told CNN it is highly unusual for the Justice Department to monitor polling places for “ballot security,” a description the department gave in a  press release  last month, as the DOJ typically watches for compliance with the Voting Rights Act.\n \n\n   \n  Compounding concerns is that both states have high-profile races — New Jersey is home to a  race for governor , while voters in California are  deciding whether  to redraw congressional maps to create five Democratic-friendly seats.\n \n\n   \n  California’s redistricting effort is part of a nationwide scramble by political parties to gain the upper hand in next year’s midterm elections for the US House. Trump instigated the redistricting battle by pushing Republicans in Texas to  draw five additional seats  to benefit Republicans in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  After it was announced that monitors would be sent to California, Gov.

Earlier last month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state would deploy its own observers to monitor the attorneys dispatched by the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t need evidence of irregularities. I simply need a basis to believe that it would be helpful for the DOJ to be there, and that’s it,” Harmeet Dhillon, who runs the department’s Civil Rights Division,  told CNN ’s Elex Michaelson. “We are not there to interfere. We are there to observe. We are there to document.”\n \n\n   \n  But the department has so far taken at least one highly unusual move: sending Dhillon’s deputy, Michael Gates, a high-ranking political appointee, to be one of two monitors in Orange County, California.\n \n\n   \n  Gates is the former city attorney of Huntington Beach, California, and has been a vigorous proponent of voter identification laws.

It’s strong enough to fell bears and soldiers \n       \n  By Maureen O'Hare, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:35 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the little wooden hut perched high on metal-wrapped stilts, the drone is high, loud and insistent.\n \n\n   \n  With his beekeeping suit on, but hands uncovered,  Hasan Kutluata   squeezes the bellows on his pine-filled bee smoker. Pale wreaths swirl in the air, mirroring the mist that drifts over the slopes of the densely forested Kaçkar mountains outside.\n \n\n   \n  The smoke is to calm the bees, masking the pheromone they release when they sense danger and which warns other bees to attack.\n \n\n   \n  When Kutluata lifts the lid off the round lindenwood hives, the hum rises to a crescendo — but these bees aren’t angry, it’s just their honey that’s mad.\n \n\n   \n  We’re here to harvest  deli bal  —  bal  means “honey” and  deli  means “crazy” or “mad” — and Turkey’s Black Sea region is one of only two places in the world to produce it, the other being Nepal’s Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain range.\n \n\n   \n  “In our untouched forests, the purple rhododendron blooms in spring,” Kutluata tells CNN. “The bees collect nectar from those flowers, and that’s how we get the mad honey.”\n \n\n   \n  The nectar contains a naturally occurring toxin called grayanotoxin. The amount that makes it into the honey varies per season and what other flowers the bees have been feasting on, but a spoonful can pack enough buzz to deliver a gently soporific high — while a jar would land you in a hospital.\n \n\n   \n  For millennia,  deli bal  has been used as folk medicine, a spoonful taken daily to lower blood pressure or used as a sexual stimulant. Today, this potentially dangerous delicacy sells at a premium price.\n \n\n   \n    The honey that defeated an army\n \n\n   \n  Kutluata uses a knife to carefully extract comb from the hive, the sticky elixir dripping thick and sweet as he gathers it in a bucket.\n \n\n   \n   Deli bal  is a dark amber red and its scent is sharp. The taste is earthy with subtle barnyard notes. There are telltale sensations that announce the presence of grayanotoxin: A herbal bitterness underlies the sweetness of the honey and a burning heat catches the back of the throat.\n \n\n   \n  Today’s honey has all the signs. “We shouldn’t eat too much. If we eat more, it might affect us,” says Kutluata. “There’s no hallucination involved. It just causes dizziness, low blood pressure, a slight fever, nausea, and difficulty walking.”\n \n\n   \n  No more than a teaspoon or tablespoon is recommended. “We have to be careful while consuming this honey,” says Kutluata. “Too much of anything is harmful. And too much honey is harmful as well.”\n \n\n   \n  This is a food that has felled armies. In the 4th century BCE, the Greek military leader  Xenophon  wrote of soldiers traveling near Trabzon on the Black Sea coast who overindulged on the sweet treat: “Not one of them could stand up, but those who had eaten a little were like people exceedingly drunk, while those who had eaten a great deal seemed like crazy, or even, in some cases, dying men. So they lay there in great numbers as though the army had suffered a defeat, and great despondency prevailed.”\n \n\n   \n    Exit, pursued by a bear\n \n\n   \n  “That’s enough for today; the bees are starting to attack,” says Kutluata, “Let’s slowly head down now.”\n \n\n   \n  Once we’re back on solid ground, the ladder goes back up to the hut so no more climbing can be done. The enemy this mini-fortress is warded against isn’t Greek armies, but honey-crazed bears.\n \n\n   \n  The metal around the poles is to prevent bears digging their claws in, and the platform’s height, some 10 feet off the ground, is to stop momma bear throwing her cub up to get the honey she can’t reach.\n \n\n   \n  Kutluata is viscerally aware of the dangers. Some 20 years after an attack, he still has scars on his hand and leg from when he fought off a bear which had raided his hives and got into a  deli bal  stupor.\n \n\n   \n  The apparently sleeping bear had roused when Kutluata and his friends approached and the ensuing chase and struggle landed Kutluata in intensive care for more than a week.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether we’re afraid of bears or not, we have to do this work,” he says. “We will continue beekeeping. We encounter bears almost every day. Whenever we go up the mountain, we come across a bear.”\n \n\n   \n  When dangerous doses of  dali bal  aren’t involved, however, “the bear doesn’t attack us. The bear runs away from us, and we run away from the bear.”\n \n\n   \n    Village of the bees\n \n\n   \n  We hop in the truck and rattle down the winding mountain tracks to Kutluata’s family home near the village of Yaylacılar, not far from Arili Köyü — the aptly named “village of the bees.”\n \n\n   \n  His parents, wife and son join us for lunch; they’re a beekeeping family of three generations. The table is set under the eaves of the traditionally styled house, with its uninhabited lower floor stacked with box beehives.\n \n\n   \n  “Our village is very cool. Summers are very cool here. There are no mosquitoes. It’s not like the city, where it’s too hot to stay,” says Kutluata. “Here, it’s a natural life. We have a river; we can go swimming. There’s no noise here.”\n \n\n   \n  The purity of the environment contributes to the quality of the honey, says his wife Emine. “What makes us different is the nature, the altitude, and the absence of settlements. That plays a huge role in the production process.”\n \n\n   \n   Deli bal  is just one of the honeys the family cultivates. After the purple rhododendron, the white chestnut flower blooms. After that, the white rhododendron is in flower.\n \n\n   \n  In summer, if the weather isn’t rainy, Kutluata’s bees can fill up a hive in about 20 days.\n \n\n   \n  “The longer the honey stays in the hive, the higher its quality becomes. The quality is determined by the promille value,” he explains. Promille refers to the concentration of the honey. “The higher the promille value, the higher the quality.”\n \n\n   \n  “Chestnut honey can be found everywhere, but it really makes a difference,” adds Emine. “In terms of the promille value, it can be 600, 700, 800, but elsewhere, it might be 500 in terms of quality.”\n \n\n   \n    Breakfast of champions\n \n\n   \n  Honey is a breakfast staple in Turkish homes and the Kutluatas show us how they mix it with butter and spread it on bread, for a hearty and high-energy start to the day.\n \n\n   \n  The food’s properties as a natural antibiotic have long been  documented ; it’s one of the world’s oldest medicines.\n \n\n   \n  To Emine, honey “represents health. If my throat is sore, I turn to honey. If I’m coughing, I turn to honey. If I’m feeling weak, I turn to honey again.”\n \n\n   \n  And to Kutluata, the bees themselves are restorative for mental health. “When I’m feeling down, I go to the bees. When I’m stressed or feeling troubled from work or the outside world, I go to the bees,” he says. “I open the hive, take care of them, and I feel peaceful and happy. And all my stress and troubles disappear.”\n \n\n   \n   Deli bal  can be sold legally in Turkey and is legal in many countries. However, the US Food and Drug Administration does not recommend its consumption.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers should check labeling of honey to ensure it is not labeled as ‘mad honey’ or marketed for intoxicating qualities,” an FDA spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Eating honey with a high amount of this toxin can lead to ‘mad honey’ poisoning, with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. This type of poisoning is rare.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/europe/rome-tower-collapse-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:13:00-05:00","title":"Medieval Tower Partially Collapses in Rome, Badly Injuring One Worker and Trapping Another","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A partial collapse of the medieval Torre dei Conti tower in Rome during renovation work injured one worker and trapped another, prompting emergency rescue operations.

president said was a mission against drug trafficking, unleashing a wave of geopolitical tensions that have kept the region on edge ever since.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not the US warships — or Caracas’ suspicions that Washington is more interested in deposing Venezuelan President  Nicolás Maduro  — that are weighing on the mind of the 49-year-old resident of Petare, Venezuela. It’s a more pressing, personal issue: how to pay the bills.\n \n\n   \n  That same week in August, his mother Tita Carreño, 75, had an accident at home and fractured her left femur, leaving her son no option but to stop working and care for her.\n \n\n   \n  Like millions of Venezuelans, Samuel Carreño is an informal worker who lives day by day — “killing tigers,” as the local slang goes. A medical emergency is simply impossible for him to afford.\n \n\n   \n  “For the operation they were asking us for US$3,000, and we had to ask for help,” Carreño said. Thankfully, his brother managed to get that price lowered through a personal contact, and following a collection among the family, Tita was operated on 30 days later.\n \n\n   \n  But Carreño still cannot leave the house because he has to care for his bedridden mother. Every day, so she can bathe, he heats water in buckets on a gas stove because his home, where five people live, does not have a water heater. He must also be careful how much he uses because, due in part to its poor infrastructure, Venezuela rations water. Carreño’s home receives running water only three days a week when he can fill up a dozen buckets.\n \n\n   \n     It’s the economy, stupid \n \n\n   \n  For many Venezuelans, like Carreño, the daily ordeal of normal life in the country is a far more pressing concern than speculative headlines about  whether the US will or will not attack .\n \n\n   \n  According to the Central Bank, in the two months that US warships have been in the Caribbean — the same period in which Tita Carreño has been bedridden — the Venezuelan bolivar depreciated by 50% against the dollar, as people sought a safe haven in the foreign currency.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the average income of around $250 per month does not even cover half the cost of the basic food basket in the country — and the official minimum wage is just 130 bolivars per month (less than 70 cents), according to the Central Bank.\n \n\n   \n  While the Maduro government is supplementing salaries and public pensions with what it calls an “economic war bonus” (a reference to US sanctions on the country) of between $80 and $100, that doesn’t go far in a country that, according to the International Monetary Fund, has the highest inflation rate in the world: 270% for 2025 and projected to surpass 680% in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “The issue of shopping is very limited by a budgetary deficiency: You buy what you can, and rarely can you stock up,” said economist Jesús Palacios, a professor at Venezuela’s Andrés Bello Catholic University.\n \n\n   \n     Hard to speak out \n \n\n   \n  While many Venezuelans are open about their economic concerns, gauging their feelings in response to the US military deployment is far harder. The country has a history of censorship and political oppression that makes many people wary of commenting publicly.\n \n\n   \n  One sign that censorship is increasing came Tuesday, when Maduro ordered authorities to adapt a mobile phone app currently used to report failures in public services, so that people could use it to inform on other citizens voicing dissent against the government.\n \n\n   \n  Sharing such opinions in Venezuela can be very costly.\n \n\n   \n  On October 8, Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello announced the arrest on Margarita Island of photographer Carlos Lesma, who was accused of writing “welcome to the gringos” on social media sites in reference to the possibility of a US military invasion.\n \n\n   \n  Lesma is one of more than 750 Venezuelans imprisoned for political reasons, according to the latest count by the   human-rights organization Foro Penal — though the Venezuelan government has repeatedly denied that these detentions are arbitrary.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 100 foreign prisoners are also believed to be held for political reasons, according to Foro Penal.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most striking of these cases is that of Jonathan Torres, a 25-year-old Venezuelan citizen who emigrated in 2015 as a minor to settle in the United States with his family. He returned to Venezuela last year by land.\n \n\n   \n  According to Torres’ mother and lawyers, he was detained in October 2024 and held incommunicado before being brought before the courts on charges of terrorism, criminal association and treason.\n \n\n   \n  But they believe the real reason for his detention is that the Maduro regime wants to use him as a bargaining chip with Washington. His mother, Rhoda Torres, first learned he was being held when another US citizen detained in Venezuela, David Estrella, was released alongside five others earlier this year following high-level negotiations between the White House and Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “They wanted to exchange him, just like all the other gringos. When they realized he wasn’t from the US and that they messed up, they still kept him there because he could be used in a swap,” Rhoda Torres told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out the Venezuelan Attorney General’s Office for information about Torres’ case and has not received a response.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the risks, Rhoda Torres campaigns openly for her son’s release, sharing videos on social media that have been watched tens of thousands of times.\n \n\n   \n  “They say not to publicize the cases, that you have to be careful, but it’s a lie: Notoriety is our only defense,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Relatives of other political detainees are often more fearful and agree to speak only on the condition of anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  “Having a family member as a political prisoner is hell,” said another woman, whose nephew has been held since September 2023, according to a document reviewed by CNN. He has not been brought before a court or charged, lawyers and relatives said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether she is afraid of what would happen if the Venezuelan government were overthrown by force, the detainee’s aunt said: “Afraid of what? Sooner or later a war will end, while for me the fear is to be here forever, or for our allied countries to leave us alone in the fight.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/middleeast/igaza-deceased-hostages-return-israel-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:27:00-05:00","title":"Israel Receives Remains of 3 More Deceased Hostages Held in Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel received the remains of three deceased hostages from Gaza following a series of transfers, including the bodies of Omer Neutra, Asaf Hamami, and Oz Daniel.

shutdown about to break record \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:35 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A defining week has dawned in American politics with huge implications for Donald Trump’s second presidency, for his fellow Republicans and for a Democratic Party seeking to build a new future from the ashes of its 2024 election humiliation.\n \n\n   \n  The government shutdown is now in its 34th day and less than 48 hours from becoming the longest ever. But none of the political stakes compare to the misery of millions of Americans now struggling to get by on $0 paychecks, or who risk losing health care or vital food assistance.\n \n\n   \n  “It feels as if the government doesn’t care. The holidays are coming — people are going to be hungry. We are the land of opportunity, and it doesn’t look like it,” Janis, a federal worker, who is the daughter and granddaughter of military veterans, told CNN’s Camila DeChalus at  a food bank in suburban Maryland .\n \n\n   \n  Trump seems oblivious to political appearances or the risk that the shutdown could further damage him among most Americans who have soured on his second term. Creating an impression of gilded indifference, he hosted a “Great Gatsby”-themed  Halloween party  at his luxury Florida club and  boasted about  the swish renovation of a bathroom at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  In a combative interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Trump showed no sign of looking for a way out that did not involve a total defeat for Democrats, whom he described as “crazed lunatics.” He said the opposition party would eventually “have to” capitulate and vote to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  The president has complicated GOP calculations by  renewing demands  for reluctant Senate Republicans to shatter  the chamber’s filibuster rule  to reopen the government with a simple majority vote. GOP leaders fear this would embolden a future Democratic majority.\n \n\n   \n  “The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We’re not going to lose power,” Trump said on “60 Minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s embittered politics, which set the stage for the Washington shutdown disaster, will take a fresh twist with a handful of  key elections Tuesday , which could help resolve the impasse. Or perhaps they’ll just deepen the morass.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will deliver the first major verdict on Trump’s second term in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats lead in the polls. The New York mayor’s race could enshrine democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as an electric new talent in a party split between wariness of his politics and enthusiasm over his youth. A victory for Mamdani over the old guard of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo would also hand a new foil to Trump, who paints the 34-year-old as the far-left face of his rival party.\n \n\n   \n  In California, meanwhile, voters will decide whether to redraw the congressional map to  favor Democrats in a clutch of seats , in response to Trump’s similar moves  in Texas and elsewhere  ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Their endorsement would be a huge boost for  California Gov. Gavin Newsom , who is claiming a national leadership role ahead of a likely run for president in 2028.\n \n\n   \n  The elections and the deepening pain over the shutdown, set off on October 1 by Senate Democrats in a bid to force Republicans to  extend Obamacare subsidies , will play out against the daily backdrop of chaos and extremes of the second Trump era. The Supreme Court on Wednesday will  hear arguments  over Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs that started a global trade war. The justices’ eventual decision could set up a showdown with the executive branch or confirm Trump’s claim of emergency powers in yet another vast expansion of presidential authority.\n \n\n   \n  The same underlying question — of whether Trump is illegally acting on powers he’s not granted by the Constitution — underpins an escalating crisis over the administration’s strikes against what it claims are drug traffickers’ boats in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Critics accuse the administration of carrying out extrajudicial killings and breaking the law by acting without congressional consent. The White House has offered no proof or justification to the American people for its actions, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has banned subordinates from  discussing the strikes with Congress  without prior approval.\n \n\n   \n  There were new signs Monday that Trump’s approach in his wild second presidency is backfiring. A new CNN/SSRS poll found the president’s approval rating is at 37%, the lowest level of his second term so far. And the country is in a sour mood, which might benefit Democrats if only they could settle on a message that has public appeal. In the poll, 68% of people say things are going badly in the country, while 72% say the economy is in poor shape.\n \n\n   \n    Shutdown misery deepens as record approaches\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, pressure on both parties to end the shutdown is becoming visceral.\n \n\n   \n  The reality of rising health care premiums for those with Affordable Care Act policies struck home with  the start of open enrollment Saturday . Premiums were already set to rise significantly because of the costs of care and drugs. But the expiration of subsidies means prices are shooting out of the reach of many policyholders. This is why Democrats sought to use the only leverage they had in Washington — the ability to block most legislation in the Senate — to force a showdown to coerce Republicans into action.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to make sure that we can decisively address the Republican health care crisis, which is crushing people all across the country,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  If the dispute was only about health care, Democrats might have  claimed victory  by now.\n \n\n   \n  But by closing the government, they precipitated the furloughing of millions of federal employees as others were forced to work without pay. This has led to  the potential cutoff of food stamps  to more than 40 million people and is disrupting air travel  as Thanksgiving looms .\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accuse Trump of withholding emergency funding they say could partially finance food stamps for this month, claims that have been validated by several federal judges.\n \n\n   \n  But the extreme disruption and costs of the shutdown are scrambling normal political calculations and may mean no party earns a clear-cut win. “It’s very unfortunate that Donald Trump and Republicans have decided to weaponize hunger and withhold SNAP benefits,” Jeffries told Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Yet House Speaker Mike Johnson pointed out that the broader deprivation caused by the shutdown would not have occurred had Democrats agreed to GOP demands to reopen the government ahead of talks on Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how they can believe they’re winning, if it were indeed a game to them,” Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday.” The Louisiana Republican said Trump was “desperate” to reopen the government and had offered negotiations. The sticking point, however, is the Republican demand for the government to reopen so talks can happen — and the Democrat belief that such offers cannot be trusted.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said on “60 Minutes” that he was ready to fix the Obamacare subsidies problem. “We should fix that. Fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats,” he said. “All they have to do is let the country open and we’ll fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  But the president, as has been the case across his two terms, did not lay out any detailed plan for making health care more affordable.\n \n\n   \n    Senators still seeking off-ramp\n \n\n   \n  Some Democratic and Republican senators have been speaking informally about a device to fund the government in the short term. But Trump’s demands to eradicate the filibuster suggest he’s got no plans to back down. This hints at what is different in this shutdown. The president has proved that he’s ready to impose pain on anyone to fulfill his political goals and that the normal logic of shutdown politics may not apply. While Democratic voters are demanding their party shows backbone against Trump, their leaders must work out a way to create an off-ramp that would allow them to claim victory.\n \n\n   \n  Warning signs are also mounting for Trump and Republicans. New polls show that the Democrats’ top demand — extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies — is popular. And in a Washington Post-ABC News poll Thursday, voters blamed Trump and the GOP more than Democrats for the shutdown by 45%-33%. The president’s approval rating is only 41% in the  CNN Poll of Polls  average.\n \n\n   \n  But public disdain for Democrats is complicating the party’s effort to exploit Trump’s troubles. Some 68% of people in the Post poll thought the party was out of touch with most Americans. And a CBS News poll found 56% disapproved of Trump’s handling of the shutdown, while 55% said the same of how congressional Democrats and Republicans are responding to the situation.\n \n\n   \n  One warning sign for Democrats is that they are being effectively forced by Trump’s hardline tactics to balance the pain of citizens who risk losing health care against the suffering of those who could lose nutrition benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman wants to reopen the government so health care and food assistance crises can be addressed. “I fully, fully support these things, but this is the wrong tactic,” Fetterman said on “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  “And right now, by doing this, our government shut down, we’re getting neither of those things, and they guarantee neither you’re going to get your SNAP benefits, and you’re not going to get those kind of tax credits that we all need,” Fetterman continued. “Reopen this thing, and we can find a way forward.”\n \n\n   \n    How will Tuesday’s election shift shutdown drama?\n \n\n   \n  One intriguing question this week would be whether a Democratic sweep in New Jersey, Virginia, New York and the California redistricting initiative would reshape Republican shutdown tactics. Republicans might panic only a year ahead of the midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson, who will lose his job as speaker if Democrats win back the House next year, insisted on Sunday that the impasse could end because the opposition party would no longer need to use it as an issue as voters make their decisions. “We do have a sense that something may change next week,” he told the Republican Jewish Coalition leadership summit during a virtual appearance Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  But a rank-and-file Republican warned Sunday his party must make health care more affordable once the government is reopened. “The midterms are going to be a whole lot harder if Republicans just sit there and say, ‘We’re just going to let it (the enhanced subsidies) lapse. We’re not going to do anything,’” Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey told CNN’s Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.”\n \n\n   \n  The cost of living has shaped campaigning ahead of Tuesday’s elections, along with Trump’s perceived excesses. “Virginia voters can and will send a message amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington,” Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in New Jersey branded GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli as a tool of Trump. But outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is also unpopular, and  Ciattarelli called for change  in a state that has sometimes chosen GOP governors.\n \n\n   \n   Former President Barack Obama  on Saturday campaigned in both states, confirming his status as one of the few A-list national Democrats — but also the party’s desperate need to find new voices.\n \n\n   \n  He told voters in Norfolk, Virginia, that the stakes were clear. “We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don’t need to wonder about whether vulnerable people are going to be hurt, or ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. We’ve witnessed it. Elections do matter,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/europe/louvre-heist-petty-criminals-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"06:49:00-05:00","title":"Louvre heist suspects are local petty criminals, Paris prosecutor says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major heist at the Louvre museum on October 19, 2025, four suspects — three men and one woman from Seine-Saint-Denis — broke into the Apollo Gallery via a truck-mounted ladder, breaching high-security display cases and stealing nine items, including a diamond and sapphire jewelry set once worn by Queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense.

it melting away as midsummer temperatures nudge toward 100 Fahrenheit, or 37 Celsius, and the heat hangs in the shimmering air?\n \n\n   \n  Because this unusual and beautiful wonder, located deep in the sunkissed hills of southwestern Turkey, isn’t snow at all. In fact the water it’s formed from sometimes spurts out of the ground at boiling point.\n \n\n   \n  And those visitors milling around its upper reaches aren’t going anywhere fast. Most are here to take in the extraordinary spectacle — and either paddle or soak in some of the planet’s most photogenic pools.\n \n\n   \n  Today, Pamukkale’s travertine limestone slopes and pools, filled with milky blue mineral water, are perfect for Instagram moments, especially as the magic hour evening sun casts their rippled surfaces in hues of pink.\n \n\n   \n    Gateway to Hell\n \n\n   \n  But this place was a tourist sensation thousands of years before social media, as first Greeks, then Romans flocked here for the thermal waters and to pay tribute at what was revered as a gateway to Hell.\n \n\n   \n  Today, Pamukkale and the ancient city of Hierapolis, which sprawls across the plateau above the white terraces, are part of a UNESCO World Heritage site that pulls in busloads of visitors. Typically, many visit for a couple of hours, but it’s worth spending at least a day in this geological and historical playground.\n \n\n   \n  Enter from the South Gate — tickets cost 30 euros (about $33) — and it’s easy to be initially underwhelmed. There’s not much to see right away apart from a few toppled ancient columns, which are a frequent sight around this part of Turkey.\n \n\n   \n  In truth, the site of Hierapolis and Pamukkale is huge, so it takes a while to reach the good stuff (golf carts can be rented for those really pressed for time or unable to walk the distances here). But it also means that the big reveal, when it comes, is even better.\n \n\n   \n  After 10 minutes of strolling along paved pathways from the gate, the line of trees that marks the edge of the plateau comes into sight. Even if you know what’s coming, there’s still a wow factor when you finally reach it, and the spectacle of that white landscape is revealed.\n \n\n   \n  Over millennia, the calcite deposited by the thermal water sputtering out of the ground has reshaped this hillside, creating white terraces that give the area its name — Pamukkale means “cotton castle” in Turkish.\n \n\n   \n  These terraces once held myriad naturally formed blue pools. Most of these are now empty of water and off-limits, leading to some complaints that the site no longer lives up to photographs that show it in years gone by.\n \n\n   \n  “It is pretty, but there’s not as much water as I’d expected,” says Mary Huang, a tourist from Guangzhou in southern China, posing for a photograph on the edge of one of the pools. “The view is gorgeous though.”\n \n\n   \n    Serene pools\n \n\n   \n  There’s still an impressive series of serene pools, which cascade down the hill. It’s a fun spot for paddling or lying down in shallow waters and mud said to have therapeutic properties.\n \n\n   \n  To explore the terraces, visitors need to remove their footwear. The rock is uncomfortable and slippery in places, but it doesn’t take long to reach the first in the series of pools where toes sink into soft sediment.\n \n\n   \n  The top terraces are the busiest, but for those willing to make their way farther down, there’s every chance of grabbing a pool to themselves.\n \n\n   \n  DJ Tiz, a South Korean music producer on a road trip across Turkey with his partner, singer Fre Naz, is among those slapping mud all over, under the watchful eye of an amicable dog. Having already sampled plenty of the country’s stunning landscapes, he declares: “I love Pamukkale the best.”\n \n\n   \n  For a more complete spa experience, there’s the Antique Pool, about five minutes’ walk from the top of the terraces. Here, for a small extra fee, visitors can use changing rooms and bathe and swim in crystal clear thermal waters over the toppled ruins of an ancient temple to Apollo.\n \n\n   \n  Better still, as you near the source of the water, in one corner of the pool, it becomes filled with tiny, fizzing bubbles — it’s like swimming in warm Champagne or soda. The water is said to offer relief to skin, cardiovascular and rheumatic complaints. Drinking from a water pump here is also said to work for digestive conditions.\n \n\n   \n    Noxious fumes\n \n\n   \n  You can spend hours wandering around the remains of Hierapolis – high spots include the wide 2nd century agora marketplace, the magnificent Roman theater and the tombs of the necropolis.\n \n\n   \n  The size of the site reveals the city’s one-time power and popularity (it even rates a  namecheck in the Bible  alongside another nearby ruined city, Laodicea, which is also worth a visit). Much of Hierapolis’ status was derived from the geothermal forces lurking beneath its surface.\n \n\n   \n  While many of the Romans and Greeks who came to the city were undoubtedly here for the warm waters, the place had great religious significance as the site of a Plutonium cave, or entrance to Hell.\n \n\n   \n  Here, much to the amazement of onlookers, sacrificial animals such as bulls would drop dead after breathing in noxious carbon dioxide fumes swirling up from below. The priests, who led them in would emerge unscathed, having learned to hold their breath.\n \n\n   \n  Today, the Plutonium — located between the Ancient Pool and the Roman theater — is another high point on the tour of Hierapolis, and one of many places in the city worth visiting in the cooler evenings when, after nightfall, some attractions are dramatically illuminated.\n \n\n   \n  While Pamukkale is enjoying more modern fame thanks to its photogenic appearance in social media posts, some locals lament the changing nature of tourism to the area.\n \n\n   \n  Ali Durmuş, who runs Pamukkale-based tour company Turkey Magic Travel, says the roping off of much of the travertines and diversion of water since it became a UNESCO World Heritage site has robbed visitors of an experience enjoyed for millennia. He says it puts them off staying longer.\n \n\n   \n  Pammukale’s  UNESCO listing  led to on-site hotels being demolished, new pools constructed, water redirected down manmade channels, improved site management and closure of the slopes to reverse degradation that had changed them from white to gray.\n \n\n   \n  “If they cannot enjoy the water, then they are not staying long. Maybe one night or just visiting for an afternoon,” Durmuş says.\n \n\n   \n  He worries that the diminished experience has meant people miss out on exploring the surrounding area, which has other geothermal attractions. Towns stretching out northwest from Pamukkale along a geological fault line tap into increasingly hotter supplies of steam and water surging up from underground.\n \n\n   \n  About 20 minutes’ drive northwest up the surrounding Denizli Basin, the town of Karahayit has spas and heating systems based around the iron-rich red waters that emerge at around 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). The town also has a lovely covered market, with street vendors selling delicious local mulberry juice.\n \n\n   \n  Farther away, in Buharkent — its name meaning “steam city” — water at boiling point powers what was Turkey’s first geothermal power station.\n \n\n   \n  In winter, it has been known to sometimes get chilly enough to snow in Pamukkale, but thanks to the primal forces that thrust up from its hellish subterranean portals and paint the hillsides white, it’s always a hot destination.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/health/autism-inclusive-communities-conversation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"How autism rates are rising – and why that could lead to more inclusive communities","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Autism diagnosis rates in the U.S. have risen from 1 in 36 to 1 in 31 by age 8 between 2023 and 2025, according to CDC data.

Conversation\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  I can say from personal experience that being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder can feel very isolating. Increasingly, however, it’s not unusual.\n \n\n   \n  In the U.S.,  1 in 31 children are diagnosed with autism  each year by age 8, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number, released in April 2025, is up from 1 in 36 in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  These statistics have been  widely characterized as concerning . But I would like to offer a different perspective.\n \n\n   \n  I am a researcher studying how young people with autism  transition to adulthood . I also work on the  Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network , which was established by the CDC two decades ago to determine the prevalence of autism in the U.S. and which produced the 2025 report.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, this topic is  deeply personal  to me, since I am diagnosed with  Asperger’s syndrome, now known as autism spectrum disorder .\n \n\n   \n  While autism does present challenges, my professional and personal experiences have taught me that creating space for autistic people’s perspectives affords opportunities for  making the world a more vibrant place .\n \n\n   \n    A rare condition?\n \n\n   \n  Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental condition that manifests differently from person to person but commonly affects how a person  communicates, socializes and interacts with the world .\n \n\n   \n  In the 1990s, researchers and clinicians estimated that autism was a relatively rare condition,  affecting an estimated 1 in 500 children . But the real-world experiences of families and clinicians suggested that it was  more common .\n \n\n   \n   Read more:  Autism charities can portray autistic people as helpless and a burden – our research shows why it matters \n \n\n   \n  In a landmark study published in 1998, researchers examined autism prevalence in a community in New Jersey to determine a more realistic estimate in the U.S. population. They found that approximately  1 in 150 children had autism  – making it more than three times more common than previously believed.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in 2000, the newly formed Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, which set out to study autism among 8-year-olds, looked across a much broader population and  confirmed the higher prevalence .\n \n\n   \n    A growing recognition\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the number of children recognized as having autism by a doctor or an education specialist has continued to rise. The 2025 report shows that  autism occurs in all types of communities . Autism affects children regardless of race, ethnicity or income level.\n \n\n   \n  Autism prevalence does vary by location, though. It is highest in California, where it is recognized in around 1 in 19 children, and lowest in Texas, where the prevalence ranges from around 1 in 103 to 1 in 51 children. In Arizona, where I live and work, the prevalence is around 1 in 32, which is very close to the CDC’s overall nationwide estimate.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers believe that this wide geographic variability in autism prevalence  reflects complex interactions  between community awareness and acceptance, the availability of clinical and education services in schools and communities that serve people with autism, broader culture acceptance of mental health challenges, and other societal factors.\n \n\n   \n  The number of autism diagnoses also varies by gender. One well-known feature of autism is that it affects boys more often than girls. In the late 1990s and early 2000s,  four boys for every one girl  was diagnosed with autism. This  disparity persisted   for many   years . But now, it seems to be shrinking: In the May 2025 data, the  ratio for boys versus girls is 3.4 to 1 .\n \n\n   \n  This shift reflects the growing understanding  that autism looks different in girls  than in boys, which in turn allows clinicians to accurately identify it in girls in larger numbers.\n \n\n   \n    From recognition to acceptance\n \n\n   \n   Research shows, however , that this increase in autism diagnoses is not something to fear.\n \n\n   \n  While some children diagnosed with autism are  profoundly affected  and require significant support, many others successfully engage in everyday activities like school, sports and work. One 2022 study found that a majority of children reported as having autism by their parents  expect to attend college . This suggests that many people diagnosed with autism feel they are capable of living full and productive lives.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, understanding the patterns of autism prevalence does not explain why it occurs in the first place. Research suggests that  genes are a major cause of autism . But many things have changed over the past several decades since researchers and clinicians began tracking autism occurrence. For example,  the criteria clinicians use to diagnose autism  have changed over time to  become less restrictive .\n \n\n   \n   Read more:  Why some autistic people don’t speak \n \n\n   \n  Today, a wider variety of symptoms are included in the diagnostic definition of autism spectrum disorder than when autism was first introduced as a  mental health condition in 1980 .\n \n\n   \n  Another change is that autism is much more widely accepted in society than it was just a decade ago. For example,  autistic characters are often portrayed in media  as protagonists that the audience is cheering for. This growing recognition and acceptance is associated with an  increase in self-diagnosis of autism .\n \n\n   \n    Building richer communities\n \n\n   \n  While autistic people tend to have  some unique challenges , including repetitive behaviors, restricted interests and social communication difficulties, they also have particular strengths, such as  creative, out-of-the-box thinking . For me, this includes seeing connections that others miss.\n \n\n   \n  Autistic people report that their  unique perspective offers specific benefits  in their workplaces and careers. Many go on to  make important contributions  to their communities and to shape society as a whole.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Temple Grandin,  an outspoken author and speaker on autism  and a professor of animal science at Colorado State University, has credited her autism with influencing her research on animal handling and animal behaviors. Comedian Dan Aykroyd, who was  an original cast member and host of “Saturday Night Live” , credits his diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome and fixation on ghosts for  developing the movie “Ghostbusters” .\n \n\n   \n   Read more:  How federal officials talk about health is shifting in ways that make me worried for my autistic child \n \n\n   \n  A more complete picture of autism that includes strengths as well as challenges creates a starting point for building communities that are inclusive and accepting of autistic people. From there, policymakers, employers and others can start to create dynamic and vibrant places where people with autism can successfully live, work and play alongside their nonautistic peers.\n \n\n   \n  And, given that  children with autism will become adults with autism , it allows experts like me to identify needs and design policies that help communities support autistic people at different stages of their life.\n \n\n   \n  For example, the growing number of students with developmental challenges  raises demands on special education services . This means state and local education systems may need to develop and implement specialized training programs for educators to better support autistic students in the classroom.\n \n\n   \n  Autistic children who need accommodations in school may also need support to succeed in adulthood. This can range from having physicians who  gear their clinical practices  to better listen to autistic patients to  work-from-home and other accommodations  that encourage engagement with traditional employment.\n \n\n   \n  Broader frameworks such as laws and policies can also help attune workplaces and other environments to the needs of people with autism. For example,  independent living programs  and programs that  train, hire and retain workers with disabilities  can ensure the economic success of people with autism.\n \n\n   \n  Cities can also become  autism certified , a process that brings together community stakeholders in health care, education, local government, hospitality and leisure to better serve those with autism. This includes training on how to interact with people who have cognitive differences as well as creating sensory-friendly environments. The city that I live in – Mesa, Arizona –  was the first to gain  such certification in 2019, and a  handful of other cities  have followed suit.\n \n\n   \n  As I see it, rather than a cause for fear, the growing recognition of autism is an invitation to build a world where every way of thinking and being has a chance to thrive.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-elections-virginia-new-jersey-new-york-california","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"As Trump awaits an early verdict with Tuesday’s elections, next year’s midterms are already on his mind","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the 2025 elections in Virginia, New Jersey, and California unfold, President Donald Trump is intensely focused on the upcoming 2026 midterms, expressing bafflement over the historical pattern of his party losing House seats during midterm elections.

Tuesday’s elections hang in the balance,  President Donald Trump  has bluntly suggested that he is already looking ahead to the 2026 midterm races with a sense of dread.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had success like nobody, but for some reason, you lose the midterms,” Trump said late last month at the White House, waxing aloud about the political backlash that most presidents face during midterm elections. “I don’t know why. It doesn’t make sense.”\n \n\n   \n  A year after winning back the White House, the first big electoral test of Trump’s second term  is taking shape in marquee elections  on Tuesday, when Virginia and New Jersey will elect governors, California will vote on a pivotal ballot measure to redraw its congressional maps, and New York City will pick its next mayor.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a chance for some voters to deliver a verdict on the actions of the new Trump administration. While hardly a perfect indicator,  the results could offer clues  about the political climate heading into next year’s elections, when voters will determine control of Congress for the rest of Trump’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to win the midterms,” Trump said as he addressed Senate Republicans during a lunch in the Rose Garden. “Otherwise, all of the things that we’ve done, so many of them, are going to be taken away by the radical left lunatics. I mean, we’re going to end up with a communist mayor in New York. Can you believe it?”\n \n\n   \n  As Trump has repeatedly made clear, the race for New York City mayor  has been on his mind  far more than any of the other races being decided Tuesday. He frequently disparages the positions of Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed  democratic socialist , who is well on his way to becoming the newest foil for Republicans as Democrats seek to rebuild their party.\n \n\n   \n  The president has followed the other contests to varying degrees, aides say, asking for more updates in the closing days and directing some campaign funds to help voter turnout efforts.   He fully endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican gubernatorial nominee in New Jersey, but  stopped short  of doing the same in Virginia, where Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP candidate, is seen as less competitive.\n \n\n   \n  “People like me there,” Trump said of New Jersey, a state where he owns golf courses and spends considerable time in the summers. “It’s typically not Republican, but turning Republican very quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  That assessment will be tested in the contest between Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made  significant gains in New Jersey  last fall — losing by 6 points to Kamala Harris, compared with a resounding 16-point defeat to Joe Biden in 2020 — but Democrats still hold considerable structural advantages, including a voter registration edge on Republicans of more than 800,000.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, a government shutdown entering a second month  hangs particularly heavy over the election , with hundreds of thousands of federal workers, active-duty military and government contractors living in the state. Trump also made gains in Virginia in 2024, but still fell short to Harris by 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, has held a consistent lead over Earle-Sears, which is among the reasons that Trump’s aides say he has not become more involved. He called into a tele-rally on Thursday night in hopes of boosting turnout for the Republican ticket. He is scheduled to give a final push Monday night from the Oval Office when he holds a telephone pep rally in Virginia and New Jersey to fire up GOP voters.\n \n\n   \n  In the final days of the campaign, Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida — far away from both states. Former President Barack Obama visited Virginia and New Jersey  to rally the Democratic base  and highlight the stakes of the election.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,” Obama said Saturday night in Newark. “Every day this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and carelessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain old craziness.”\n \n\n   \n    The Trump effect\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats win their races in Virginia and New Jersey, the outcome could offer a window into some of the headwinds facing Trump and Republicans going into next year’s elections. Yet if Republicans win — or deliver a split verdict — it may suggest that Democrats have misjudged how much of a liability Trump could pose to his party.\n \n\n   \n  “If you get a flat tire on the way home today, she’s going to blame President Trump,” Ciattarelli tells supporters of Sherrill at most every campaign stop, hoping to make light of Democratic finger-pointing at Trump. “There’s nothing she won’t blame on the president.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are seeking to ride an early wave of voter discontent, hoping to deal a political setback to Trump a year after his historic return to power. In his first term, Democrats won the races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey in 2017 before going on to take control of the House the following year in a sweeping victory.\n \n\n   \n  The White House is working hard to avoid a replay of that scenario.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the driving force behind  a redistricting arms race  playing out across the country. After Texas drew new congressional lines that could add up to five Republican seats in the House, California responded with the ballot initiative to redraw districts to favor Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina and Missouri have already followed the president’s call to squeeze more Republican seats by redrawing congressional districts, while efforts are underway to follow suit in other GOP-led states such as Indiana and Kansas, where political and procedural obstacles remain. Democrats in Virginia  gave approval Friday  to a proposed constitutional amendment to do the same, while some party leaders in Illinois are exploring possible changes to the state’s map.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an unprecedented mid-decade gerrymandering effort — akin to changing the rules in the middle of the game — that started with an order from the Oval Office. Trump still fumes about the investigations and impeachment proceedings that played out during the second half of his first term after Democrats won control of the House.\n \n\n   \n  “The president is obsessively focused on the midterms,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions. “He remembers what happened the first time he was in office.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Everything’s about Trump’\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s name, of course, is not actually on Tuesday’s ballot. If it was, Republican strategists say they would feel far more bullish about rebuilding a Trump coalition that could provide a stronger path to victory.\n \n\n   \n  He figures prominently into the strategies of both sides.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are counting on a disdain for the president and an objection to his policies to help energize and unify their base. Republicans are working overtime to motivate those who love Trump, paying extra attention to voters with shaky attendance records in off-year elections.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to send a message to Washington,” said Neil Wintfeld, a Virginia Democratic voter who dropped by a Spanberger rally in Alexandria during the closing days of the race. “President Trump generates a lot of negative enthusiasm and motivates people to react to the destruction he is visiting upon our institutions.”\n \n\n   \n  Sharon Cox, a Republican who voted for Trump in each of his three presidential bids, said she was tired of politicians of all stripes invoking the president’s name in elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything’s about Trump, it seems,” Cox said after casting an early ballot in Hampton, Virginia. “I know everybody’s not going to like Trump. I know everybody’s not going to like somebody on the Democratic side, but the hate has to go before our country can move forward.”\n \n\n   \n  While the lessons of these elections can be overstated, there is little question the results of Virginia and New Jersey will be analyzed — at least in part — through a Trump-colored lens, given how he is  already laser-focused  on the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  “If you have a great presidency, it only makes sense that you win the midterms,” Trump said in his Rose Garden remarks, expressing his bafflement that only twice in nearly a century has the president’s party not lost House seats in a midterm election. “There might be some dark, deep psychological reason where they want to vote the opposite way. I don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/mamdani-spanberger-democrats-two-paths","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"08:13:00-04:00","title":"Why Tuesday’s elections could give Democrats two paths to coming back from Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the internal divisions within the Democratic Party as it seeks to recover from a major electoral loss under Donald Trump’s second presidency.

paths to coming back from Trump \n       \n  By Edward-Isaac Dovere, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:13 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Only a party going through the Democrats’ identity and existential crises could, nine months into Donald Trump’s second presidency, have  Zohran Mamdani  and  Abigail Spanberger  as its front-runners in two of  Tuesday’s biggest races .\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger is a 46-year-old former CIA officer, the daughter of a nurse and a federal agent, who sounded the alarm in Congress and now on the campaign trail about what she sees as her party’s excesses. Mamdani is a 34-year-old democratic socialist, the Uganda-born son of a university professor and filmmaker, who sprung to stardom with a focus on cost of living conveyed in buzzy, multilingual videos pushing for government to pay for more.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t a sitcom pitch: It reflects   a party still deep in figuring out what it’s supposed to be and how it’s supposed to appeal to voters.\n \n\n   \n  Heading into Tuesday’s elections, Democrats are far from resolving the schism between progressives and moderates that  undermined them in last year’s presidential race . But many in the party are fearful of being tied to Mamdani’s  democratic socialism  or  anti-Israel views  even as they buzz about his  breakthrough communications  and the passion he has inspired.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger is clear about her differences with Mamdani. She spoke to CNN on Friday on her campaign bus, leaving   an event in Ashland, Virginia, where the woman who introduced her said sometimes she feels she’s the only Democrat in the area.\n \n\n   \n  “Why is it that everybody keeps thinking somebody running in a city, admittedly an enormous city, that  that  is the deciding race?” she asked.\n \n\n   \n  When asked what she made of Mamdani declaring at an  October rally in Manhattan  that he had already won the battle over the soul of the Democratic Party, Spanberger’s mouth twitched into a smile.\n \n\n   \n  “Then maybe,” she said, “he should be a Democrat.”\n \n\n   \n  Acknowledging when pressed that Mamdani is in fact the Democratic nominee, Spanberger said that for all the talk — including from within the  Democratic Socialists of America itself  — about the DSA’s growing power, she doesn’t see democratic socialism on the rise.\n \n\n   \n  She argues there’s a level of dishonesty in some of the big promises Mamdani is making that she worries could hurt Democrats with voters long term, saying the reason she doesn’t have a Mamdani-style proposal for  government-run grocery stores  is “because I couldn’t ever pass it.”\n \n\n   \n  “People do want us to be aspirational and dream big. They also don’t want us to lie to them,” she told CNN. “When you have a party that makes promise after promise, and then say, ‘Oh, we passed it in the House, it’s not our fault’ — vulnerable people believed you. Maybe he is going to get Albany on board with totally refinancing public transportation. But there’s a lot of people who believe him.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s campaign did not respond when asked about Spanberger’s comments. But asked at an event on Friday about whether he wants Democrats to have room for more moderate campaigns in Virginia and New Jersey, where US Rep. Mikie Sherrill is running with a similar approach to Spanberger’s, Mamdani was conciliatory.\n \n\n   \n  “Absolutely, I think that this has to be a party that actually allows Americans to see themselves in it and not just be a mirror image of just a few people who are engaged in politics,” he said. “To me, what binds all of us together is who we are fighting to serve, and that is working people.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger argued that many polls show her more likely to break 50% in her state than Mamdani is in his city.\n \n\n   \n  She’s facing a Republican who  failed to win Trump’s endorsement  and who faced GOP criticism over her campaign. He’s in a three-way race, but Mamdani and his close advisers are focused on the 50% mark themselves —for what kind of mandate he’ll be able to claim both for his agenda and the broader direction he wants to set for the party.\n \n\n   \n    Can both visions co-exist?\n \n\n   \n  Mayoral races in New York don’t usually have national implications. That was before the shocker out of this year’s primary as Mamdani went from 1% in the polls to knocking off former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in his political comeback. Now New York City has the marquee race, with Mamdani trying to consolidate Democrats and defeat Cuomo’s independent run appealing to Trump supporters and moderates.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Ro Khanna, a Silicon Valley congressman and former Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair, is the only Democrat known to be considering a 2028 run who’s campaigned with Spanberger, Sherrill and Mamdani, as well as supporters of the Democratic-led redistricting effort in California.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s mind-boggling to me that we don’t have more people recognizing” the importance of how much Mamdani has electrified young voters and beyond, Khanna told CNN. He added that he hopes national Democrats also recognize how Spanberger pitched herself to rural counties and Sherrill to the suburbs.\n \n\n   \n  They fit together, Khanna said, in that Democrats are “rejecting the status quo and saying we need a fresh generation of leaders and saying, ‘We’re not going to define our identity around Donald Trump.’”\n \n\n   \n  But the Democratic leaders plotting next year’s campaigns say Mamdani won’t be their blueprint.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters in the Arizonas or the Iowas aren’t thinking about who the mayor of New York might be. They’re thinking about who’s going to understand the issues facing our community and going to fight to make a difference back in Washington, DC,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington state congresswoman and chair of the House Democrats’ campaign arm. “It is hard to draw conclusions from a bright blue city versus look at what it’s like in purple districts where you have just that huge diversity, in terms of points of view and different issues.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether she’s thought about New York City as she looks at this year’s gubernatorial contests and the 36 races looming next year, Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Meghan Meehan-Draper told CNN, “Not really.”\n \n\n   \n  “I understand why there’s attention on it — but at a moment when our party’s struggling and our brand is struggling, if you want to be a party that wins, gets results and is popular in the eyes of voters, you should look to Democratic governors,” Meehan-Draper said.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill —  a personal friend  of Spanberger’s who keeps up with her on the campaign trail via text — tends to respond to questions about Mamdani by pointing out that she won her own primary by a big margin with a field that included candidates closer aligned to Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “New Jerseyans want competence — they want someone who is going to attack prices, someone who is listening to their concerns,” she told CNN’s John Berman recently.\n \n\n   \n  And when CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday asked House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries whether he thought Mamdani was the future of the party, the New York Democrat responded, “No.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s response to Jeffries hours later: “That’s good to know.”\n \n\n   \n    Spanberger crafts her own blueprint\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger’s mode isn’t Mamdani’s big-smile charisma. She knows that her buttons and T-shirts haven’t become a political fashion statement. But she says she’s tired of people saying she’s not exciting. Along with Sherrill, she helped flip the US House to Democratic control during Trump’s first term. She got bills signed by Joe Biden and Donald Trump — “that is not easy to do,” Obama joked while  rallying for her  Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  A year after some panicked Democrats declared after Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump that women can’t win, operatives beyond New York have joked that maybe the answer is just slightly younger women who are moms and, given Spanberger’s CIA work and Sherrill’s time as a Navy   helicopter pilot, were maybe involved with killing some people.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger laughed at that suggestion, but said what people read into her biography helped her tap into a moment with parallels to when she first won in the post-Trump midterms — but with key differences.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t even call it the resistance anymore. People have matured in their advocacy,” she said, arguing that while 2017 was defined by protests of a growing base nearly every weekend, now there are clearer, starker stakes and “layers of people who were not anywhere in play in ’17, who are in some cases leading the charges in their communities to make differences.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and his aides say that feeling of people left out of politics for so long is exactly what he’s tapping into.\n \n\n   \n  “Too long we’ve been told that we should wait,” he said Saturday in Queens, but “to wait would be to trust who gave us this moment, who delivered us to it.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s part of why Mamdani and his advisers bristle so much at those who write him off as a great campaigner with a great production team.\n \n\n   \n  “The style is downstream from the substance,” Andrew Epstein, his communications director through the primary and now his digital director, told CNN in an earlier interview. “Unless you have a message and an agenda that is directly relevant to people’s lives, that speaks to the economic conditions in this country, that credibly presents itself as an alternative to this incredibly broken status quo and the alienation that so many people feel from mainstream politics, it’s not going to work.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ruben Gallego, who ran well ahead of Harris last year in his swing state of Arizona to win his seat, said he felt comfortable campaigning just for Spanberger and Sherrill.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think Mamdani could win in Arizona, I don’t think I could win New York City, but it doesn’t mean that some of this stuff is also wrong. He cares about the cost of living like many of us; we just take different approaches to it,” Gallego told CNN after finishing speaking at a Mexican restaurant in Alexandria for Spanberger.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats “have always been that way,” Gallego said. “Look at the Republicans, look at those weirdos, man. They have a weird span of things.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/entertainment/jennifer-aniston-jim-curtis-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"06:32:00-05:00","title":"Jennifer Aniston Goes Instagram-Official with Boyfriend Jim Curtis","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jennifer Aniston has officially confirmed her relationship with mental health advocate and wellness educator Jim Curtis on Instagram, marking her first public romantic involvement since her split from Justin Theroux in 2018.

And in the day’s most anticipated matchup, the Buffalo Bills survived a last-gasp effort from the Kansas City Chiefs.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you may have missed on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n     Bears make an incredible last-minute comeback \n \n\n   \n  The script flipped a few times in Cincinnati on Sunday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The Chicago Bears led by two touchdowns with five minutes left in the game, another seeming disappointment for the Bengals on home turf. Bengals quarterback Joe Flacco found Noah Fant for a 23-yard touchdown pass with 1:43 to go, and then Cincy converted on the two-point conversion attempt to pull within six points.\n \n\n   \n  The Bengals then lined up for a desperation onside kick and, thanks to the slightest of touches off a Bears player’s foot, managed to recover the ball to get possession back.\n \n\n   \n  Flacco again drove his team down the field and, with 54 seconds to play, hit Andrei Iosivas for a 9-yard touchdown pass. The Bengals converted the extra point and suddenly had the lead with less than a minute to go. An incredible comeback had Paycor Stadium rocking in disbelief.\n \n\n   \n  A few moments later, it would be silenced as that disbelief turned to shock.\n \n\n   \n  Bears quarterback Caleb Williams hit tight end Colston Loveland with a pass and the tight end barely evaded two Bengals defenders, who hit each other instead of Loveland. To the dismay of the home fans, Loveland scampered 58 yards for a touchdown, stealing the lead – and the game – back for the Bears with just 17 seconds to play. The Bears won 47-42.\n \n\n   \n     Josh Allen and the Bills outduel the Chiefs \n \n\n   \n  In a matchup of two of the game’s brightest stars, Bills quarterback Josh Allen bested Patrick Mahomes and the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs in the weekend’s highest-profile game, winning 28-21.\n \n\n   \n  Allen had an extremely efficient performance, going 23-for-26 and passing for 273 yards, passing for one touchdown and running for two more. James Cook III put in a strong game for the Bills on the ground, running for 114 yards, and Dalton Kincaid led the way for the team’s receivers with six catches for 101 yards and one touchdown.\n \n\n   \n  The Bills got ahead early and stayed in front, holding off a late charge from the Chiefs. Kareem Hunt ran in a 1-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter to cut the Bills’ lead to seven, and the Chiefs had the ball last with a chance to tie. Ultimately, Mahomes’ Hail Mary pass was batted away by Buffalo defenders.\n \n\n   \n     Minnesota defeats the Lions in NFC North clash \n \n\n   \n  The Minnesota Vikings got their franchise quarterback back on the field on Sunday and J.J. McCarthy showed why the team bet on him this offseason.\n \n\n   \n  McCarthy’s stat line wasn’t that impressive – 14-for-25 passing for 143 yards, two touchdowns and an interception – but the second-year man from Michigan showed incredible moxie to navigate a tricky away game against the two-time defending division champions.\n \n\n   \n  The key play came in the final minutes after the Jared Goff hit Jameson Williams for a touchdown to bring the Lions back within three points. Needing a first down to seal the game, McCarthy found Jalen Nailor for a 16-yard gain to convert on a high-pressure third down that allowed the Vikings to take a knee and run out the rest of the clock.\n \n\n   \n  The 27-24 victory for the Vikings reinvigorates their season in the incredibly tight NFC North. All four teams – Minnesota, Detroit, Green Bay and Chicago – are all separated by less than two games.\n \n\n   \n     Washington’s star quarterback injured again in loss \n \n\n   \n  The Washington Commanders entered this season looking like one of the league’s new powers after their run to the NFC championship game last season behind quarterback Jayden Daniels.\n \n\n   \n  Those hopes have gone up in smoke this year.\n \n\n   \n  Daniels had already missed multiple games this year with a left knee sprain and right hamstring sprain, and now it appears he’s going to be on the shelf for a significant amount of time. The second-year quarterback was injured in the fourth quarter when his left arm buckled underneath him as he was being tackled by a Seattle Seahawks defender, a gruesome injury that’s being called a dislocated elbow by the team.\n \n\n   \n  The game was already well out of hand that point after the Seahawks scored four touchdowns in the first half to take a 28-0 lead. The Commanders never really got back into it, and the game finished 38-14.\n \n\n   \n    Cam Little’s record field goal and last-second wins\n \n\n   \n  There have been only six field goals of 64 or more yards in NFL history, and three have come this season. On Sunday, Cam Little had the longest one of all time.\n \n\n   \n  The Jaguars’ kicker was good from 68 yards at the end of the first half in Jacksonville’s 30-29 overtime win against the Las Vegas Raiders. Not only was it the longest field goal made in NFL history – but he also cleared the distance with room to spare.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, two visiting teams stole wins from their hosts on field goals as time expired.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Panthers defeated the Green Bay Packers in Lambeau Field on a 49-yard field goal by Ryan Fitzpatrick as time run out for a 16-13 win in a disappointing showing for the Packers.\n \n\n   \n  The Denver Broncos rallied in the second half to defeat the Houston Texans, 18-15. The Texans lost quarterback C.J. Stroud early in the contest when he took a big hit in the first half.\n \n\n   \n  Will Lutz kicked a 34-yard field goal as time expired for the winning points.\n \n\n   \n  There was also one missed kick that ended up sealing a game this weekend. The Atlanta Falcons fell on the road to the New England Patriots, 24-23. The Falcons looked to have tied the game up in the fourth quarter with less than five minutes to go on Drake London’s third touchdown catch of the game but Parker Romo missed the extra point. It would prove to be the deciding margin.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/economy/scotus-trump-tariffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:44:00-04:00","title":"Trade deals and $90 billion in tariff revenue: What’s riding on the landmark Supreme Court case kicking off this week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on whether President Donald Trump had the legal authority to impose high tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he used to raise import taxes as high as 145% on China, 50% on India and Brazil.

$90 billion in tariff revenue: What’s riding on the landmark Supreme Court case kicking off this week \n       \n  By Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:44 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In just a few days, the Supreme Court will start hearing arguments in what President Donald Trump is calling “one of the most important cases in the history of our country.”\n \n\n   \n  With the bulk of his tariffs — arguably the cornerstone of his entire economic agenda — in jeopardy, he has floated an unprecedented appearance at the nation’s highest court.\n \n\n   \n  The case will consider whether Trump had the legal authority to impose tariffs by citing a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n \n\n   \n  Trump used those powers to push import tax rates as high as 50% on key trading partners including India and Brazil and  as high as 145%  on China earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  A ruling against the president does not mean the sudden cancellation of all tariffs in place, but the outcome could radically reshape Trump’s economic strategy.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s riding on the Supreme Court’s decision:\n \n\n   \n    Almost $90 billion in tariff revenue\n \n\n   \n  As of September 23, American businesses have paid nearly $90 billion to cover the IEEPA tariffs being challenged, according to US Customs and Border Patrol data. That’s more than half of the tariff revenue the country collected during the 2025 fiscal year, which ended on September 30.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Trump said in an interview with Fox Business that if the Supreme Court ruled against him, “we’d have to pay back money” and reimburse companies for the billions of dollars they have already paid.\n \n\n   \n  While the case plays out — and it could go on for several months — businesses will need to keep paying IEEPA tariffs, so the sum of potential refunds will keep growing.\n \n\n   \n  However, it would not be an easy or quick process for businesses to get refunds. It’s also unclear if all businesses that have paid these tariffs would qualify for a refund. The justices would likely make such determinations if they ultimately render Trump’s IEEPA tariffs illegal, trade attorneys  told CNN .\n \n\n   \n    Trade agreements\n \n\n   \n  The threat of instantly imposing higher tariffs is a  key tool  Trump has used to pressure countries into entering trade agreements and, in some cases, signing deals with the United States. In exchange, trading partners have committed to increasing purchases of American goods and increasing their investments in American businesses on top of lowering tariffs on American exports.\n \n\n   \n  But all that could be jeopardized if the Supreme Court sides against Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “The IEEPA tariffs have been the basis for countries to reach agreements with the United States, and it is unknown what happens if the IEEPA tariffs no longer can be imposed,” Dave Townsend, a partner in Dorsey & Whitney’s International Trade Group, said in a note last week.\n \n\n   \n  “Presumably, the Trump Administration will claim that nothing changes, and that the agreements remain valid,” he added. But it could certainly incentivize trading partners to try to go back to the drawing table with Trump, aiming to get better arrangements. It could even empower some countries to impose their own retaliatory tariffs on American exports until their own border taxes are lowered.\n \n\n   \n    What this means for Trump’s tariff agenda\n \n\n   \n  US presidents have always had an  extensive menu  of tariffs to impose. But Trump has mainly used two in his second term: the IEEPA tariffs and Section 232 tariffs, which give the president the authority to impose higher tariffs on national security grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Section 232 tariffs can only be used to target specific industry sectors, and require an investigation by the Commerce Department. Trump has used Section 232 this year to raise border taxes on autos, auto parts, steel, aluminum, copper and furniture, among others. He’s also initiated several ongoing investigations that could result in higher levies on a slew of other goods.\n \n\n   \n  Trump will retain the ability to impose those tariffs as well as several others no matter how the Supreme Court rules. But none of those will allow him to change import duties with the flick of a switch, as he has done with IEEPA.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/americas/mexico-mayor-killed-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:29:00-04:00","title":"Mexico’s Sheinbaum pledges justice after murder of outspoken anti-crime mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The assassination of Carlos Manzo, a vocal anti-crime mayor in Uruapan, Michoacán, Mexico, during a Day of the Dead festival has sparked national outrage and intensified concerns about the safety of independent politicians.

Sheinbaum pledges justice after murder of outspoken anti-crime mayor \n       \n  Reuters\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:29 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum promised on Sunday there would be justice for the brazen murder of a local mayor, Carlos Manzo, an outspoken critic of organized crime who had called on the government to do more to protect him and others.\n \n\n   \n  Manzo, 40, was shot on Saturday while attending a candlelight Day of the Dead festival in the city center of Uruapan, in the violence-plagued western state of Michoacan.\n \n\n   \n  Two suspects were arrested and a third was dead, Mexico’s security ministry said on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum called an emergency meeting of her security cabinet on Sunday morning, later condemning Manzo’s “vile” assassination in a statement on X.\n \n\n   \n  “We reaffirm our commitment to deploy all the State’s efforts to achieve peace and security with zero impunity and full justice,” Sheinbaum wrote.\n \n\n   \n  A march was called for Sunday in Michoacan’s capital, Morelia, to demand justice for Manzo’s death and an end to violence and corruption.\n \n\n   \n  One of the few independent politicians elected to office in Mexico, Manzo had been Uruapan’s mayor since September 2024. Since taking office, Manzo, often seen wearing a bulletproof vest, had called on the federal government to do more to fight organized crime while expressing fears for his own safety.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to be just another mayor on the list of those executed, those whose lives have been taken from them,” Manzo said in an interview in September with Mexican journalist Joaquin Lopez-Doriga.\n \n\n   \n  Uruapan has been called Mexico’s avocado capital because it sits in the heart of Michoacan’s avocado-growing region. The  industry  has seen  rapid growth  due to booming U.S. demand, making avocado production a target for organized criminal groups.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple politicians,  including other mayors , and journalists have been killed in recent months and years.\n \n\n   \n  “How many mayors haven’t they killed because they opposed making these pacts with organized crime?” Manzo asked in a September interview with Mexico’s Milenio TV.\n \n\n   \n  He appealed to Sheinbaum for stronger public security measures and said Uruapan’s avocado industry gave it importance ahead of a coming review of Mexico’s trade deal with the U.S. and Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Manzo also said greater determination was needed on the part of Security Minister Omar Harfuch.\n \n\n   \n  “Minister Omar Harfuch, help us,” Manzo said in the interview.\n \n\n   \n  In a Sunday press conference, Harfuch said Manzo had had federal protection since December 2024, which was reinforced in May. The protection included 14 National Guard troops tasked with perimeter security, while local police provided immediate security.\n \n\n   \n  “The aggressors took advantage of the vulnerability of a public event,” Harfuch said, referring to Manzo’s murder. “Be certain that there will be no impunity.”\n \n\n   \n  U.S. officials condemned the killing.\n \n\n   \n  “The U.S. stands ready to deepen security cooperation with Mexico to wipe out organized crime on both sides of the border,” Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau wrote on X, sharing a photo of Manzo with his young son shortly before the mayor’s murder.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/style/abandoned-homes-america-bryan-sansivero-photography","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:08:00-05:00","title":"A portal into another life: Photographing America’s abandoned homes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bryan Sansivero, a New York-based photographer, has spent a decade photographing abandoned homes across the United States, using medium-format film to capture their decay as time capsules of forgotten lives.

EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The houses are worn by weather and time, photographed in isolation like forgotten monuments. They have a haunted feel: Windows are boarded on Victorian-era turrets; paint flakes off the towering composite columns of a once-grand portico; wraparound verandas, perhaps once host to evening nightcaps and slow Sunday mornings, are barren. Walls crumble, roofs collapse, and greenery reclaims them.\n \n\n   \n  For a decade, the New York-based photographer  Bryan Sansivero  has sought out forgotten, dilapidated homes across the United States — each with its own story to tell. Inside deserted clapboard farmsteads, palatial Antebellum-era plantation houses and maximalist Queen Anne-style structures, Sansivero has discovered many residences that were never emptied, offering a portal into another life.\n \n\n   \n  Musty libraries are filled with books, papers and photographs; in one, a nearby coffee mug sits unretrieved. Grand pianos and half-full liquor bottles collect dust, while colorful children’s playrooms scattered with toys are unsettlingly idle. The images come together in his  latest book , “America the Abandoned: Captivating Portraits of Deserted Homes.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s about capturing these time capsules; these lost places,” he explained in a phone call. “I like the mystery of not knowing what you’re going to find.”\n \n\n   \n  Sansivero has documented abandoned spaces since he was a film studies major in college, starting out with the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, a disused psychiatric hospital in Long Island that served as the setting for his documentary thesis.\n \n\n   \n  Over time, he found himself drawn to private residences — millions of which are abandoned across the country — especially as urban exploration, or “urbex,” became a highly monetized form of social media content that has become what he likens to a competitive sport. Abandoned hospitals, churches and schools are easy to find; houses, on the other hand, have a sense of discovery.\n \n\n   \n  “If you go viral, you can get two million likes and hundreds of thousands of followers, and people are trying to chase that,” he said, saying it becomes about “the most views, the biggest and the best and all of that.”   Instead, Sansivero has reacted in opposition, opting for the slow and deliberate methodology of medium-format film — though he does still post his images to more than  100,000 followers on Instagram . “For me, I’ve just been going backwards. I want to shoot more film. I want to shoot less digital, with an emphasis on using older, unique equipment.”\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean the homes Sansivero finds have been untouched since they were inhabited. Many have been destroyed or vandalized, perhaps by squatters, teenagers or the urbex set. Occasionally, he’s gotten a tip on a house only to find it filled by other photographers and content creators racing to be there first.\n \n\n   \n  But often, he finds houses by chance, or with help from Google Earth, taking weeklong trips to the South or Midwest to areas impacted by the loss of industry or other economic or environmental pressures.\n \n\n   \n  His treks come with risks — he’s inhaled mold (and now carries masks), his leg has gone through a decaying floor, and he’s felt the uneasy sway of a home seemingly near collapse. Yet he’s been undeterred, drawn to dramatic architecture and eccentric or historical collections, such as a room stacked high with vintage dollhouses, mannequins populating a house like ghosts, or interiors still decorated for a Christmas of the distant past.\n \n\n   \n  “I can find a dozen or more houses exploring in a day and not want to photograph anything, because it’s an empty shell or it’s been trashed — it’s not telling a story about the previous owner,” he said. “I’m interested in what happened, why it was left like this.”\n \n\n   \n  Sansivero researches the houses he photographs to whatever extent he can, but in “America the Abandoned,” he shares limited details, giving a sense of who lived there but anonymizing them, avoiding social media’s instinct to exploit or exhaust a tragic story. Among the homes he has discovered are former respective residences of a local politician, an important fashion and textile designer, and a Pulitzer-Prize winning author. In one house, filled with life-sized mannequin mermaids, he found a disturbing published account that told the tale of a serial killer with victims in the basement, he recounted. The mermaids’ origins remain unknown.\n \n\n   \n  The photographer found that former residence by chance when he was with a friend on the road; the boarded-up brick property by the highway was unmissable. “We were just driving down the highway, and I was like, ‘Oh, look at that house.’”\n \n\n   \n  Lately, Sansivero has set his sights overseas, exploring chateaus and castles in Europe whose histories can stretch back much further in time. “America the Abandoned” may be a cap on a decade-long exploration of US homes, but it’s likely more a pause than an end to the work. After all, as Sansivero noted, with time, there will always be more to discover.\n \n\n   \n   Images: Excerpted from “America the Abandoned: Captivating Portraits of Deserted Homes” © 2025 Bryan Sansivero.

crossroads \n       \n  By Eric Levenson, Ryan Young, and Cynthia Salinas Cappellano, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Brian O’Hara took over the Minneapolis Police Department in 2022, he saw a department in free fall.\n \n\n   \n  The  murder of George Floyd  and the ensuing riots in 2020 had fractured the public’s trust in law enforcement. Crime and shootings were rising at startling levels. The police force was demoralized and dropped from over 900 sworn officers to a low of 550 last year, stretched dangerously thin in a city of over 400,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  “It was, essentially, kind of a hopeless situation,” O’Hara told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “When I got here, the Minneapolis Police Department was functioning more like a Fire Department,” he said. “The officers were traumatized. They were sitting in the station, only going out on calls. There wasn’t that much proactive activity happening.”\n \n\n   \n  Three years later, staffing has begun to recover. Using an aggressive recruitment strategy, the police department surpassed 600 sworn personnel in June – a  milestone Mayor Jacob Frey praised in a city news release .\n \n\n   \n  But challenges and criticisms remain, including a recent mass shooting at a homeless encampment, state and federal consent decrees and questions about police’s interaction with federal immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Minneapolis voters will have their say.\n \n\n   \n  A mayoral election on Tuesday pits Frey, the two-term incumbent, against over a dozen challengers, led by three progressive rivals: State Sen. and Democratic Socialist Omar Fateh, attorney and businessman Jazz Hampton and minister DeWayne Davis. That trio has criticized the city’s public safety efforts and joined forces for a “ slate for change ” in an election that uses  ranked choice voting .\n \n\n   \n  Early polling shows Frey as the favorite, with Fateh his closest competitor.\n \n\n   \n  The election bears some similarities to New York City’s, with both Fateh and Zohran Mamdani as 30-something, Muslim, Democratic Socialists who have proposed rent stabilization policies.\n \n\n   \n  In Minneapolis, police staffing and public safety have been key concerns among voters – for example, they were the first two questions in a mayoral debate hosted by  MPR News/Star Tribune  last week.\n \n\n   \n  The terms of the debate have generally pitted Frey, who has criticized calls to “defund the police,” against a left-wing critic in Fateh, who  has said  Frey “failed to implement meaningful reforms to police” and has pushed to shift some responsibilities from police to other departments.\n \n\n   \n  Whoever wins the race will have the power to set the city’s police culture, said Michelle Gross, the president of the activist group  Communities United Against Police Brutality . Yet no matter who is in charge, she said, the future success of the police will come from building trust with the community.\n \n\n   \n  “Things are different now, but they’re not all the way different, but we’re getting there,” she told CNN. “And the bottom line is to keep people at the table so we do get there.”\n \n\n   \n    The battle to regain public trust\n \n\n   \n  Jason Fletcher, the founder of Fletcher’s Ice Cream & Cafe, got an up-close view of the Minneapolis police when his shop was targeted by a  Molotov cocktail  twice within a 24-hour period last week.\n \n\n   \n  The explosive attacks caused damage to his shop, though no one was injured. He said he believes the LGBTQ Pride flag outside his business may be the reason it was targeted.\n \n\n   \n  Fletcher said he didn’t have the “highest expectations” for police, noting its well-known staff shortages and other issues.\n \n\n   \n  “I definitely have seen a lot of the officers that are here, they’re discouraged,” he told CNN. “I feel like they’ve lost the passion for their job, a lot of them, and a lot of them are scared.”\n \n\n   \n  But the job they did investigating the attacks was “really amazing,” he said. Police responded to the scene before he did both times and worked quickly and efficiently to arrest a suspect.\n \n\n   \n  “They were reassuring. Minneapolis arson – the officer, he looked me in the face and said, ‘I’m not gonna go home until this man is behind bars.’ And he didn’t lie,” Fletcher said. “In less than four hours, they apprehended him and made sure they got him off the street.\n \n\n   \n  “In my opinion, Minneapolis police and ATF, they killed it. They did a great job.”\n \n\n   \n  As police chief, O’Hara said his primary goal has been to push a sense of urgency and pride in the department, while still acknowledging its unique challenges.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re the most scrutinized police department on earth. It’s a tough job,” he said. “But if you do come on this job, and you’re coming on for the right reasons, you have an opportunity, once your career is over, to look back on what you’ve done and realize every day of your life you have an opportunity to make a real difference in people’s lives.\n \n\n   \n  “There are people in this community who have real needs, who desperately need the police and they need good police,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  That pitch has helped the department start to rebuild its staff, now up to 620 sworn members and looking to continue growing into next year, O’Hara said. Still, the department relies on an “exorbitant” amount of overtime just to do basic police work and cover all its shifts.\n \n\n   \n  “The amount of overtime that we depend on for those things is not sustainable,” he said. “But the good news for our officers that are here is those numbers are rising, but it is a gradual process. It’s going to take time.”\n \n\n   \n    The politics of public safety\n \n\n   \n  No matter who wins the mayoral election, Minneapolis is still legally required to enact police reforms.\n \n\n   \n  After a jury convicted former police officer  Derek Chauvin  of the murder of George Floyd in 2021, the Department of Justice launched an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department. The  DOJ issued a report  in 2023 finding the city and police engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives people of their rights. This January, the city and DOJ agreed to a  federal consent decree  that requires police reforms and court supervision.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights  reached a court-enforceable agreement  with Minneapolis requiring changes to address race-based policing.\n \n\n   \n  In May, the DOJ under President Donald Trump  moved to end  the federal consent decree. However, Frey signed an  executive order  confirming the city’s commitment to implementing the reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Gross, the community activist, said her group has been working with police on its reforms.\n \n\n   \n  “The Minneapolis Police are rewriting their policies, and as part of the condition of doing that work, they actually have to take input from the community, and we have been working very hard to give them very robust input,” she said. “It’s not word-smithing, it’s looking at best practices and looking at what has worked in other departments.”\n \n\n   \n  The hope is these consent decrees and agreements provide a path forward for the city and police.\n \n\n   \n  “These are good things,” she said. “It gives us a framework to make the kinds of improvements we need to make. Unfortunately, we’re still a long way from getting there, but we’ve got a way to get there.”\n \n\n   \n    What the candidates have said about policing\n \n\n   \n  The mayoral candidates have taken different approaches to the politics of policing in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Four years ago, Minneapolis residents  rejected a ballot measure  that would have overhauled the city’s police structure, replacing the police department with a Department of Public Safety. The measure, wrapped up in “ defund the police ” debates, had been drafted amid the national fury over Floyd’s murder but was put to voters as concerns about rising crime drained energy from the protest movement.\n \n\n   \n  Fateh supported the ballot measure. Frey did not.\n \n\n   \n  That contrast has been on display this mayoral election, as Frey has accused Fateh of supporting defund the police measures.\n \n\n   \n  “Here’s the truth: We also need more police officers to be able to handle these situations. When you have less officers per capita than virtually any city in the country, you need to do the necessary work to increase that,” Frey said.\n \n\n   \n  Fateh has countered that he is merely proposing moving some responsibilities from the police to other departments. He has repeatedly cited a study from  NYU Law’s Policing Project  that found 47% of police calls are “potential” candidates for an alternate response.\n \n\n   \n  “If we’re able to take away nearly half of their caseload, then we can have law enforcement focus on violent crime, on drug trafficking, on human trafficking, clearly the case backlog, not taking away investigators from the caseload or their investigatory work,” Fateh said.\n \n\n   \n  For O’Hara, a transplant from Newark, New Jersey, his first mayoral election in Minneapolis has been a lot to take in.\n \n\n   \n  “I have been surprised by how overly politicized policing is here,” he said. “I’m just not used to it. I’m used to more people being able to agree we need police and we need good police, and we need to address this stuff urgently. Some of it is a little foreign to me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/federal-workers-shutdown-furloughed-job-fairs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Job fairs, hobbies and community conversations: How federal workers are coping with shutdown angst","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the government shutdown continues past a month, over a million federal workers remain furloughed without pay, leading to severe financial stress, especially for those with chronic health conditions like diabetic neuropathy.

\n        5:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Almost every day, Angela O’Neal sits down in her at-home creator’s studio, either painting, sketching or contemplating her next original piece to add to an abundant collection.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, her daily ritual has taken on a new meaning as she faces the same challenges as many furloughed federal employees — struggling to pay mounting health care bills, a mortgage and the costs of living without a steady paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown persists past a month, over a million furloughed federal workers will continue to go without pay, including this Prince George’s County, Maryland, resident.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been somewhat devastating for a lot of us,” O’Neal told CNN during an interview in her home. “I don’t think I realized the extent of it until after I saw that I’m not able to go to (physical therapy) appointments because of that… and so it’s been tremendously stressful for a lot of us, and in particular for caregivers and people with chronic health conditions.”\n \n\n   \n  O’Neal works for the US Navy as a program manager and is celebrating 40 years of government employment. She received a letter from her employer stating she had been furloughed on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  She has diabetic neuropathy, which affects mobility and causes numbness, tingling and burning sensations in her feet. One of her main concerns is not being able to afford her medical appointments, some of which she already canceled due to copay costs up to $90. “If I don’t have income, then I can’t make those appointments,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  During these uncertain times, O’Neal leans on her artistic hobby — not only as a coping mechanism, but also as a second form of income. She sells her paintings, prints and posters on her personal website, at rotating exhibits and even at a local cafe.\n \n\n   \n  “Reality changes when there is a picture of it,” O’Neal said. “As a contemporary artist, I am fascinated by how art can alter the way we see and feel. … So, during this government shutdown and furloughing, I find great solace in painting.”\n \n\n   \n    Hedging their bets: Furloughed workers head to job fairs\n \n\n   \n  O’Neal manages the unpredictability through artistry, but others may take a more direct, career-driven approach by canvassing job fairs — some out of precaution, others near desperation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN attended two job fairs in the Washington, DC, area recently. Many furloughed government employees at these events did not want to give their names or speak on camera for fear of losing their jobs. But they gave sobering accounts of the hardships they’re facing.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m supporting my kids. I have to tell them we have to budget,” one employee, who was furloughed from the Internal Revenue Service, said at a fair in McLean, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Another employee who didn’t want to name his agency said he’s supporting a young family. “I came all the way from Maryland … an hour-and-a-half, looking for a job,” he said. After struggling to describe the hardship of going weeks without getting paid, he finally told CNN, “I don’t know how much I have left in the tank right now, just to talk to you.”\n \n\n   \n  But a furloughed employee at a job fair in Maryland spoke openly about her struggles to cope with the shutdown.   \n \n\n   \n  Elizabeth Baker of Montgomery County received a stop-work order from her employer at the start of the shutdown. She is a policy analyst contracted to the National Institutes of Health through her employer.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t be here at a job fair if I weren’t trying to hedge my bets, as much as my employer has been very good to me,” Baker told CNN, adding that “we’re down to survival.”\n \n\n   \n  Baker told CNN that to financially cope with the shutdown, she is cashing in her holiday pay, using unemployment insurance and consulting on what to do if she can’t pay her rent.\n \n\n   \n  The event hosted by the workforce development group WorkSource Montgomery served federal workers and contractors throughout the area at a time federal workers are particularly in need of support, said the group’s executive director, Anthony Featherstone.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s tough being out of work as a federal worker. You’ve gone to school. You have lots of education and experience and are highly compensated, and now you’re in limbo,” Featherstone said.\n \n\n   \n    A focus on mental health\n \n\n   \n  K Scarry, the owner of the Kbird bar in northwest DC and a former minister, has hosted weekly “opt-in community conversations” for furloughed workers, offering them a chance to share their hardships and to network for other jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Scarry set up an additional session last week, inviting CNN along with furloughed workers. But no workers showed. Scarry said she received texts from some of them saying they didn’t want to speak to the media out of fear of retaliation. She told CNN what the conversations have been like in those weekly sessions.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s questions about, you know, ‘How do we talk to our kids? Our kids know the government is shut down. They know we work for the government. How do we have that conversation with our kids without overpromising, but also making sure they feel steady?’” she said. Scarry is offering free meals to any furloughed worker who comes to her bar.\n \n\n   \n  Baker stressed the importance of furloughed workers maintaining their mental health during this period of uncertainty. Her advice to others in her same predicament: “Look, the situation is real. It’s rough. Adapt how you can. … Keep the hope. Keep striving. You’re smart. You’ll get through this.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/cnn-poll-democrats-trump-midterms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Democrats More Enthusiastic About Midterms as Trump’s Approval Hits Second-Term Low, CNN Poll Finds","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the United States approaches the 2026 midterm elections, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS reveals that Democrats are showing strong enthusiasm among registered voters, with 47% indicating a preference for a Democratic candidate and 41% stating they would vote to oppose President Donald Trump.

Trump’s approval hits a second-term low, CNN poll finds \n       \n  By Jennifer Agiesta, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One year out from the midterm elections, the Democratic Party holds a sizable enthusiasm advantage as views of President Donald Trump dip further into negative territory, according to a new  CNN poll conducted by SSRS .\n \n\n   \n  The fall of 2025 is not a replay of 2017, the year before the Democrats captured control of the US House in Trump’s first term. The Democrats’ 5-point advantage among registered voters in the generic congressional ballot falls short of  the 11-point edge they held in CNN polling  a year before the 2018 midterms. And favorable views of the party still stand  near all-time lows  as they have throughout this year, 8 points below where they were in the fall of Trump’s first year in office.\n \n\n   \n  In a midterm election year, though, views of the president can outweigh perceptions of the opposition party. Trump’s approval rating in the poll stands at 37%, the worst of his second term in CNN polling and roughly equivalent to his 36% approval rating at this point in his first term.\n \n\n   \n  And his disapproval rating, at 63%, is numerically the highest of either term, one point above the previous high of 62% as he was leaving office in January 2021.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Poll of Polls  average, which puts Trump’s approval rating a few points higher at 41% as of Sunday, charts a similar trend since January. Approval of the president has dipped across partisan and demographic lines since the summer in CNN’s polling.\n \n\n   \n    Democrats have a very early advantage\n \n\n   \n  Looking ahead  to next year’s midterms, Democrats appear to have a very early advantage: 47% of registered voters say they’d vote for the Democrat in their district if the election were held today, while 42% prefer the Republican. More say they’ve ruled out supporting a Republican (42%) than say the same about a Democrat (35%). And 41% say they would be sending a message that they oppose Trump with their vote, nearly double the 21% who say their vote would be a message of support for the president. Independents break in Democrats’ favor on the generic ballot (44% to 31% for Republicans, with 19% saying they wouldn’t pick either right now).\n \n\n   \n  Registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents are far more likely than Republican-aligned voters to say they are extremely motivated to vote next year (67% compared with 46%). Those Democratic-aligned voters who consider the state of democracy to be a top concern are perhaps the most fired up within the party: 82% in that group say they are deeply motivated to vote, compared with 57 % among Democratic-aligned voters who call the economy their top concern.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s poll results suggest that the Democratic Party’s ongoing internal image troubles may not necessarily translate into defections at the ballot box. Democratic-aligned voters remain far less fond of their own party (65% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party) than Republican-aligned voters (80% have a favorable view of the GOP), but even those Democratic-aligned voters with a negative view of the party are almost universally behind the Democratic candidate in their district (93%) and broadly motivated to vote (71% say they are extremely motivated).\n \n\n   \n  All told, Democrats hold a 12-point advantage among those voters who say they are extremely or very motivated to turn out next year.\n \n\n   \n    Broad dissatisfaction with Trump and the country\n \n\n   \n  Americans are broadly dissatisfied with the state of the country (68% say things are going badly) and the economy (72% say it’s in poor shape, and 47% call the economy and cost of living the top issue facing the US). About 6 in 10 (61%) say Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 8 in 10 consider the federal government shutdown a crisis (31%) or a major problem (50%), and 61% disapprove of Trump’s handling of it. Nearly as many disapprove of the way each party’s congressional leadership is handling it (58% disapprove of each). Taken all together, about 9 in 10 American disapprove of at least one of those three players on the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  A majority hold negative views of Trump’s performance on several other key issues: most (56%) feel that his foreign policy decisions have hurt America’s standing in the world and 57% say he’s gone too far deporting immigrants living in the US illegally.\n \n\n   \n  About a quarter of Americans (26%) say the state of US democracy is the top issue facing the nation, and it is the top issue among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (45% say it’s the most important issue, with the economy and cost of living at 38%).\n \n\n   \n  Americans are increasingly likely to say Trump has gone too far in using the power of the presidency – 61% say so, up 9 points since February. On his teardown of the East Wing of the White House, 54% of the public is dissatisfied or angry, with just 10% saying they’re satisfied with or happy about that decision. Another 36% (including nearly half of Republicans) say it doesn’t matter much to them.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans also see the Republicans who control Congress as doing too much to support Trump (55%, up from 48% who felt that way in February).

\nUpdated: \n        12:28 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The final race of the 2025 NASCAR Cup Series season came down to the wire with  Kyle Larson  beating out Denny Hamlin to secure his second career Cup Series championship at Phoenix Raceway in Avondale, Arizona on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Larson was one of the four drivers including Hamlin, Chase Briscoe and William Byron in contention for the title, but Larson managed to finish in third position, ahead of the other three contenders to claim the championship.\n \n\n   \n  The race came with some drama as a late caution sent the finale into overtime.\n \n\n   \n  The 44-year-old Hamlin, who was looking to finally achieve glory after making his NASCAR debut in 2004, found himself three laps away from the win when Byron got a flat tire and hit the wall alongside the track to bring out the caution.\n \n\n   \n  The Joe Gibbs Racing driver, Hamlin, then went to pit for four new tires while Hendrick Motorsports’ Larson only got two which placed him in fifth position ahead of Hamlin, who was in 10th.\n \n\n   \n  With not enough time in the race, Hamlin finished in sixth as Ryan Blaney, who was eliminated from title contention last week, took the checkered flag.\n \n\n   \n  It is the second championship for the 33-year-old in 11 seasons. Larson won his  first title in 2021  when he joined Hendrick Motorsports.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, I can’t believe it. We didn’t lead a lap today and somehow won the championship,” Larson told the NBC broadcast after the race. “Really, I’m just speechless. I can’t believe it. We had an average car at best.”\n \n\n   \n  An emotionless Hamlin sat in his car, wiping his face with a towel as Larson celebrated with his team. After some time, Hamlin emerged from his car and was greeted by his Joe Gibbs Racing teammates, relishing the fact his sixth attempt at a title wasted away despite leading 208 of the 319 laps after starting on the pole.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing I could do different. I mean, prepared as good as I could coming into the weekend and my team gave me a fantastic car,” Hamlin said. “Just didn’t work out. I was just praying ‘no caution’ and we had one there. What can you do? It’s just not meant to be.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamlin said his crew chief made the right call with the tires and reiterated that the team did a “fantastic job” while sounding defeated on his future chances.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll try. I got a couple more shots at it but man, if you can’t win that one, I don’t know which one you can win,” Hamlin added.\n \n\n   \n  Larson, the only Asian American to race full-time in NASCAR, has not won a race since May, totaling 24 consecutive races but thanked his crew chief Cliff Daniels for keeping the team together.\n \n\n   \n  “Unbelievable! What a year by Hendrick Motorsports team. Cliff Daniels, everybody,” Larson said. “His leadership – his complete leadership just showed that whole race. Keep us all motivated. Always having a plan and all that. So, thats the story of our season.”\n \n\n   \n  Briscoe finished in 18th with Byron coming in 33rd after the late issue.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/japan-takaichi-north-korea-kim-jong-un-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"03:08:00-05:00","title":"Japan’s New Leader Takaichi Says She Wants to Meet North Korea’s Kim Jong Un","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has announced her intention to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, marking the first such move by a Japanese leader in over 20 years.

Kim Jong Il offered an apology at the time, saying the agents responsible had been punished, and promised to prevent it happening again, according to Japanese  government statements  at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The five detainees were returned to Japan the following month and reunited with their families – 20 to 30 years after their abduction.\n \n\n   \n  Koizumi returned to North Korea to meet Kim Jong Il a second time in 2004, during which the family members of several abductees were also allowed to return to Japan.\n \n\n   \n  No further repatriations have happened since then – and no progress has been made in talks between the two countries, despite repeated efforts by successive governments.\n \n\n   \n  Abe, who was assassinated in 2022, had  signaled a willingness  to meet Kim Jong Un without conditions to improve ties between their countries; several years later, then-leader Fumio Kishida also  conveyed his intention  to meet the North Korean leader.\n \n\n   \n  Each time, a meeting failed to materialize.

federal government shutdown  continue, with this past weekend marking the worst for air traffic control staffing shortages since the shutdown began, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Aviation Administration operations plans.\n \n\n   \n  Between Friday morning and Sunday night, there were 98 “staffing trigger” reports at FAA facilities, meaning air traffic controllers had to alter operations to keep the airspace safe with fewer people working.\n \n\n   \n  The alterations can include rerouting planes or delaying flights when there are not enough controllers to handle the normal workload.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers are considered  essential staff  and must work during the government shutdown, despite not getting paid. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said some controllers have called in sick in protest while others are taking time off to work other jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Not every staffing shortage results in a delay, as controllers can reroute flights, but sometimes there is no choice but to slow planes down to maintain safety.\n \n\n   \n  Friday, which was Halloween, saw 46 facilities impacted by staffing shortages. On Saturday, 34 facilities were short staffed and on Sunday, the number was 18.\n \n\n   \n  Control towers in Austin, Texas; Newark, New Jersey; Boston, Dallas, Denver, Nashville and Phoenix were all short staffed at some point over the weekend. Shifts of controllers who deal with flights enroute at high altitude, and other controllers who handle approaching and departing airports were also short staffed.\n \n\n   \n  The team that manages flights headed to Newark Liberty International Airport reported more staffing triggers than any other single operation.\n \n\n   \n  A “surge” in controllers calling out on Halloween “strained” staffing at half of the  30 largest airports  in the country,  according to the FAA . Nearly 80% of air traffic controllers were out Friday at facilities in the New York City area.\n \n\n   \n  “Air traffic controllers are under immense stress and fatigue. The shutdown must end so that these controllers receive the pay they’ve earned, and travelers can avoid further disruptions and delays,” the  FAA said  Friday.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown, which began October 1, enters its second month, “it’s only going to get worse,” Duffy said Sunday on  CBS’ “Face the Nation.”  “Does it become a flight emergency, a safety issue? No, we will stop traffic. So, we’re not going to let that happen. I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of the shutdown, 393 facilities have reported a staffing trigger – roughly four times as many as were reported on the same dates last year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/big-business-supreme-court-trump-tariffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Big business sits out the Supreme Court fight over Donald Trump’s tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court is hearing a significant legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada.

Experts and business leaders attribute this inaction to fear of retaliation from the Trump administration, which has historically targeted companies that oppose its policies. The case centers on whether the IEEPA allows for tariff-like measures even without explicit mention of 'tariff,' with the administration arguing that a reversal would disrupt trillions in trade agreements.

Big business sits out the Supreme Court fight over Donald Trump’s tariffs \n       \n  By John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s   one of the most significant economic cases to reach the Supreme Court in years – the blockbuster battle over President  Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs  – but   the nation’s largest companies are sitting on the sidelines.\n \n\n   \n  The battle to stop Trump’s tariffs is being waged by   a group of small businesses – including a family-owned  toymaker in Illinois  and a New York-based wine importer. They have advanced the case to the nation’s highest court even as their larger and better-known competitors have remained notably silent.\n \n\n   \n  The lack of public input from major US companies on the docket of a Supreme Court appeal with potentially vast consequences for their bottom line and   the economy as a whole is unusual and likely based at least in part on a fear of retribution from the White House, multiple people involved with the case and outside experts said.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court hears   arguments Wednesday in the case, which will determine the fate of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs as well as duties he has unilaterally imposed on imports from China, Mexico and Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made the tariffs, a response to trade imbalances and fentanyl trafficking, the centerpiece of his economic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked that those with much more power and money did not step up,” said  Victor Owen Schwartz , the founder of V.O.S. Selections, the wine and spirits company that is one of the lead plaintiffs in the litigation. “So when I was afforded the opportunity to speak for small American business, I took it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has relied on a 1970s-era emergency law to reshape global trade and   alliances with allies and adversaries. The law lets a president “regulate importation” during emergencies, but does not specifically mention tariffs. Relying on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trump has rapidly turned some of those tariffs on and off and adjusted rates suddenly to squeeze or ease the pressure during negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  The small businesses suing the administration say the moves are driving costs – and uncertainty – to intolerable levels.\n \n\n   \n  While the president has described the case as an existential one for the country, he has avoided criticizing the companies involved in the litigation directly. Small businesses generally enjoy bipartisan political support and so having lesser-known companies lead the legal charge on tariffs may prove to be a strategic advantage.\n \n\n   \n  Several plaintiffs interviewed by CNN were careful to frame the case as far away from national politics as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an asphyxiating tax,” said Rick Woldenberg, the CEO of Learning Resources, which makes educational toys and other products and which is also a lead plaintiff.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not targeting Mr. Trump because I’m not a politician,” he said. “I’m a taxpayer who’s been hit with an unlawful tax.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has argued the law’s words clearly encompass tariffs, even if the word “tariff” is not explicitly included. And it has warned that a loss would have “catastrophic consequences” for the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “Plaintiffs would unwind trade arrangements worth trillions of dollars, as President Trump has leveraged the IEEPA tariffs into negotiated framework deals with major trading partners – including the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and now China – that address underlying causes of the declared emergencies,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration’s top appellate lawyer, told the Supreme Court in written arguments last week.\n \n\n   \n    Taking a side\n \n\n   \n  Even when they are not named plaintiffs, major companies often wade into Supreme Court cases with friend-of-court briefs, offering their own take on the controversy pending before the justices.\n \n\n   \n  Three years ago, more than 60 major American firms – including General Electric, Procter & Gamble and Intel –  signed a brief urging the justices  not to end affirmative action in college admissions, for instance.\n \n\n   \n  Months later, the court  ignored their advice . Today, some of the same companies that signed that brief are facing  criticism in the second Trump administration  for efforts to expand diversity within their workforces.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, Apple CEO Tim Cook  personally signed an amicus brief  at the high court supporting the continuation of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA , program created during the Obama administration for Dreamers. Home Depot  signed a brief in 2021  in a case on damages suits. Walmart  jumped into an appeal  in 2017 dealing with the credit card industry.\n \n\n   \n  But the big difference today is the administration’s willingness to  pursue retribution  against critics. Large companies, including many that have been affected by the tariffs, also avoided weighing in on the cases as they moved through lower federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  “The federal government has immense leverage and immense power and can upend your business with a tweet or a tax investigation,” said Gregory Shaffer, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “I think there’s a sense that companies wanted to be more careful with this administration.”\n \n\n   \n  Friend-of-the-court briefs rarely have sway over the outcome of a case at the Supreme Court, but they can sometimes influence justices in unexpected ways. Last week, an amicus brief from a Georgetown law professor led the court to  pause a case involving Trump’s use of the National Guard  in Illinois and request additional information from both the administration and state officials.\n \n\n   \n    Fearing the ‘pain cave’\n \n\n   \n  Cassie Abel, founder and CEO of a women’s outdoor apparel company called Wild Rye, agreed that fear of retaliation was probably part of the reason that larger companies haven’t engaged in the tariffs appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Abel, who launched her company in Idaho nearly a decade ago, noted that Walmart and other retailers  endured public blowback from Trump  this year when they threatened tariff-related price increases.\n \n\n   \n  “That was a clear signal that anyone who wants to speak out against this is going to be in the pain cave,” said Abel, who joined an amicus brief with other small businesses opposed to the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  But larger companies, Abel said, also may not be as immediately affected by tariffs as small ones. Some can switch supply chains or absorb the costs. And, Abel said, some of her largest competitors have pushed back on tariffs – just in quieter ways that don’t involve taking a public position in a high-profile case.\n \n\n   \n  Some, meanwhile, have  managed to secure exemptions  to mitigate the impact of the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Several major companies that have submitted briefs in high-profile cases at the Supreme Court in the past – including Apple, Levi Strauss, Walmart and Home Depot – did not respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The briefs that have made their way to the Supreme Court overwhelmingly oppose Trump’s emergency tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Former national security officials, a group representing the watchmaking industry, nearly three dozen former federal judges, a Virginia-based seller of audio equipment and many other small businesses told the justices they’re opposed to the import taxes. The Chamber of Commerce also filed a brief in favor of unwinding Trump’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also not clear who is funding the litigation. Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at Liberty Justice Center, a group involved in the case, told CNN that it is funded by “individuals and groups that support our mission” but said it doesn’t disclose its donors without their permission.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of calculations going on,” said Gregory Husisian, a trade lawyer who represents large importers for the Foley & Lardner law firm. Large companies, he said, have to think about what legal argument they can raise “that’s not already before the court.”\n \n\n   \n  Without that, he said, “what do you really gain by being the person who sticks your neck out?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/automakers-outlook-tariff-regulation-impact","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Carmakers worried Trump’s tariffs would shred their bottom lines.

Here’s how they avoided the worst of it \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When President Donald Trump introduced his tariff policy   earlier this year, it looked like a disaster for automakers. But even with US tariffs on imported cars and parts, it has shaped up to be a pretty good time for car companies.\n \n\n   \n  Most automakers, even US-based ones, import some cars and most parts. But car companies’ dire cost estimates have decreased as tariffs keep getting rolled back, bit by bit.\n \n\n   \n  More   importantly for automakers’ bottom lines, the financial penalties for not meeting fuel efficiency rules have all but vanished. Those regulatory savings could eventually offset the cost of tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  All in all, one could argue that auto industry profits could end up better off than they were before Trump took office in January, a surprising outcome as automakers’ huge investments in electric vehicles in recent years were also being undercut by Trump pulling the plug on the federal support of electric vehicles they had counted on when making that massive bet.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s definitely favorable,” said Jeff Schuster, an independent auto analyst about the changes since auto tariffs were first announced in March. “There are so many moving pieces, it’s hard to isolate. But things are definitely better off than anyone expected.”\n \n\n   \n    Tariff costs not as bad as feared\n \n\n   \n  Automakers were close to panic when Trump announced plans for a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, including those from Mexico and Canada, since all companies depend on imported parts to build at US assembly plants and almost all import from those neighboring countries. Ford CEO Jim Farley said the tariffs “would blow a hole in the US industry that we’ve never seen.”\n \n\n   \n  But it turned out it wasn’t as bad as they feared, as Trump continued to reduce the worst of the duties’ impact almost immediately. General Motors and Ford, which had forecast billions in annual costs, have each reduced those assessments. GM trimmed its $5 billion estimate by $500 million last month. Ford cut its estimated tariff cost for 2025 in half, from $2 billion to $1 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Volkswagen reported a 1 billion euro loss ($1.3 billion) in the third quarter and said that the tariffs would cost it up to $5.8 billion this year. But some of the loss was due to other problems with its European EVs and a reorganization at Porsche.\n \n\n   \n  While tariff costs have also trimmed automakers’ profits, companies managed to beat expectations. For example, GM’s adjusted earnings per share had been forecast to fall 23% in the third quarter. Instead, it fell just 5%. Even the Volkswagen loss was less than a quarter of forecasts.\n \n\n   \n  Even automakers from Asia and Europe have been able to weather the storm, since they build a significant share of their US-sold vehicles in America.   \n \n\n   \n  Hyundai CEO José Muñoz told reporters in New York in September that even with the US tariffs, the United States, not South Korea, is Hyundai’s most profitable market. He expects that to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “Tariffs are still a headwind,” said Dan Ives, analyst with Wedbush Securities. “But so far they’ve been digested well.”\n \n\n   \n  And further tariff reductions are likely if the administration reaches a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico —   two of the largest sources of imported cars and auto parts.\n \n\n   \n  Trump recently halted Canadian trade negotiations after an ad funded by the province of Ontario featured a 1987 anti-tariff speech by former President Ronald Reagan. But experts think there will be some kind of trade deal in the future.\n \n\n   \n  A free trade deal with South Korea, another source of imported vehicles, would also help reduce tariff costs for not just Hyundai and Kia but also General Motors, which builds some of the cheaper cars at its US dealerships in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  The blunted tariff impact has also benefitted car buyers.\n \n\n   \n  Companies have not passed on the increased tariff costs to consumers, at least not directly. However, there have been some quiet moves by automakers to recoup some of the costs of the duties, such as charging for equipment that had once been included in the price, or ending production on less profitable models.\n \n\n   \n  As a results, the average price of a new car purchase stands at just around $50,000, according to estimates from Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book, up about 4% from a year ago.\n \n\n   \n    Big savings from regulatory changes\n \n\n   \n  While tariffs capture most of the headlines about government action, there’s been a less publicized windfall for automakers: the end of financial penalties for violating emissions standards.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, automakers avoided fines for selling too many gasoline vehicles by purchasing so-called regulatory credits from companies that fell below emission standards, like electric vehicle maker Tesla.\n \n\n   \n  But those penalties were eliminated in July’s tax and spending bill, saving the automakers billions. Ford CFO Sherry House told reporters last month it will no longer purchase the $2.5 billion worth of regulatory credits it had planned to buy in the future.\n \n\n   \n  Ives said that no longer having to buy credits should reduce the cost of building a vehicle by 3% to 5%. Automakers can also ramp up sales of the more profitable large trucks and SUVs that were previously capped by emissions levels.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Ford announced it was increasing production of its F-150 and F-Series Super Duty in 2026 by more than 50,000 trucks to meet demand.   GM also revealed plans to shift production of one of its Michigan plants from EVs, which have been losing money, to profitable gasoline powered vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  “As the regulatory costs go away, that does paint a much better picture for the health of the industry than anyone thought would be passed,” said Schuster. “The near-term outlook is much more favorable than in April.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/mississippi-woman-kills-escaped-monkey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00Z","title":"Mississippi woman kills escaped research monkey fearing for her children’s safety","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 35-year-old professional chef in Heidelberg, Mississippi, Jessica Bond Ferguson, shot and killed an escaped Rhesus monkey after being alerted by her son.

safety \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:05 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   Heidelberg, Mississippi (AP) —  One of the monkeys that  escaped last week  after a truck overturned on a Mississippi roadway was shot and killed early Sunday by a homeowner who says she feared for the safety of her children.\n \n\n   \n  Jessica Bond Ferguson said she was alerted early Sunday by her 16-year-old son, who said he thought he had seen a monkey running in the yard outside their home near Heidelberg, Mississippi. She got out bed, grabbed her firearm and her cellphone and stepped outside where she saw the monkey about 60 feet away.\n \n\n   \n  Bond Ferguson said she and other residents had been warned that the escaped monkeys carried diseases so she fired her gun.\n \n\n   \n  “I did what any other mother would do to protect her children,” Bond Ferguson, who has five children ranging in age from 4 to 16, told The Associated Press. “I shot at it and it just stood there, and I shot again, and he backed up and that’s when he fell.”\n \n\n   \n  The Jasper County Sheriff’s Office confirmed in a social media post that a homeowner had found one of the monkeys on their property Sunday morning but said the office didn’t have any details. The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks took possession of the monkey, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Before Bond Ferguson had gone out the door, she had called the police and was told to keep an eye on the monkey. But she said worried that if the monkey got away it would threaten children at another house.\n \n\n   \n  “If it attacked somebody’s kid, and I could have stopped it, that would be a lot on me,” said Bond Ferguson, a 35-year-old professional chef. “It’s kind of scary and dangerous that they are running around, and people have kids playing in their yards.”\n \n\n   \n  The Rhesus monkeys had been housed at the Tulane University National Biomedical Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, which routinely provides primates to scientific research organizations, according to the university. In a statement last week, Tulane said the monkeys do not belong to the university, and they were not being transported by the university.\n \n\n   \n  A truck carrying the monkeys overturned Tuesday on Interstate 59 north of Heidelberg. Of 21 the monkeys in the truck, 13 were found at the scene of the accident and arrived at their original destination last week, according to Tulane. Another five were killed in the hunt for them and three remained on the loose before Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The Mississippi Highway Patrol has said it was investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred about 100 miles from the state capital, Jackson.\n \n\n   \n  Rhesus monkeys typically weigh about 16 pounds and are among the most medically studied animals on the planet. Video recorded after the crash showed monkeys crawling through tall grass beside the interstate, where wooden crates labeled “live animals” were crumpled and strewn about.\n \n\n   \n  Jasper County Sheriff Randy Johnson had said Tulane officials reported the monkeys were not infectious, despite initial reports by the truck’s occupants warning that the monkeys were dangerous and harboring various diseases. Nonetheless, Johnson said the monkeys still needed to be “neutralized” because of their aggressive nature.\n \n\n   \n  The monkeys had recently received checkups confirming they were pathogen-free, Tulane said in a statement Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Rhesus macaques “are known to be aggressive,” according to the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. It said the agency’s conservation workers were working with sheriff’s officials in the search for the animals.\n \n\n   \n  The search comes about one year after  43 Rhesus macaques escaped  from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research because an employee didn’t fully lock an enclosure. Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, had set up traps to capture them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/asia/maldives-generational-smoking-ban-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"11:19:00.000-05:00","title":"Maldives Makes Smoking Illegal for Generations Born After 2007","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Maldives has become the first country in the world to enforce a nationwide generational tobacco ban, prohibiting the sale, purchase, and use of tobacco for anyone born after January 1, 2007.

smoking, buying and selling tobacco illegal for anyone born after January 1, 2007.\n \n\n   \n  The ban took effect on Saturday in the South Asian archipelago, “marking a historic milestone in the nation’s efforts to protect public health and promote a tobacco-free generation,” said the  country’s Ministry of Health. \n \n\n   \n  This measure “makes the Maldives the first country in the world to enforce a nationwide generational tobacco ban,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Smoking causes more than seven million deaths globally each year, according to the  World Health Organization . As of 2021, more than a quarter of the Maldives’ adult population (aged 15 to 69) used tobacco, according to a  national survey . That rate was almost double for young teens aged 13 to 15.\n \n\n   \n  By comparison, close to 20% of adults in the  United States  used tobacco in 2022, and almost 12% of adults in the  United Kingdom  were smokers in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Though the Maldives is the first country to enact such a ban, similar proposals have been debated – and nearly imposed – in other parts of the world.\n \n\n   \n  New Zealand came close to imposing something similar in 2022, when the government passed a world-leading smoking ban that would have prohibited the sale of tobacco to anyone born after January 1, 2009.\n \n\n   \n  But the ban, which was supposed to go into effect in 2024, never came to fruition. Just a year after the bill was passed,  it was rolled back  to help pay for tax cuts – infuriating public health officials and anti-tobacco groups.\n \n\n   \n  Similar bills were proposed in Britain in recent years but failed to pass;  a new version  is now making its way through parliament. The bill would ban tobacco for anyone born after January 1, 2009, and strengthen regulations on the sale of tobacco and vaping products.\n \n\n   \n  A number of British health leaders signed  an open letter  last week calling for the bill’s passage, and decrying delays in the process so far. In the six months since the bill’s last debate in parliament, more than 120,000 young adults have started smoking, claimed the letter, signed by the leaders of major hospitals, cancer charities, and branches of the National Health Service (NHS).\n \n\n   \n  The Maldives ban is just the latest in the country’s years-long effort to crack down on tobacco and smoking – including electronic cigarettes.\n \n\n   \n  The government  banned  the import, possession, use, manufacturing and distribution of all vapes in the Maldives in late 2024, regardless of age.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities are now hoping to cut down on smoking everywhere across the archipelago, with plans to set up  anti-smoking clinics t hat will offer medication to help people quit tobacco products.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this summer, the president even  proposed a cash reward  for residents on any island that completely eliminates smoking.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/what-to-know-elections-virginia-new-jersey-new-york","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"01:44:00-05:00","title":"Tuesday’s key races: What to know about the NYC election and other contests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tuesday’s U.S. elections, occurring in key states such as New York City, New Jersey, Virginia, California, and Texas, are pivotal in assessing public sentiment amid the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency and in evaluating Democratic momentum ahead of the 2026 midterms.

Tuesday’s key races: What to know about the NYC election and other contests \n       \n  By Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:44 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Elections in multiple states on Tuesday are set to gauge how voters feel in the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency — and whether Democrats have improved their standing with the midterm elections just one year away.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will choose new governors in Virginia, where the ongoing shutdown and Trump’s efforts to remake the government have affected hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and New Jersey, where increasing taxes and utility costs have placed affordability at the center of a competitive race.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City, the Democratic primary winner,  Zohran Mamdani , faces former Gov.  Andrew Cuomo , who is attempting a political comeback as an independent, and Republican Curtis Silwa in a mayoral race with significant implications for the future of the city and the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  And in California, the race to redraw  congressional district boundaries  ahead of next year’s battle for majority control of the US House of Representatives faces a critical moment.\n \n\n   \n  A special election in Texas caps an important set of odd-year elections. Here are the races and issues to watch Tuesday:\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Cuomo are facing off a second time in the New York City mayoral election, after Mamdani — a  democratic socialist  who has energized young voters and progressives with his go-anywhere, do-anything campaign tactics and a message centered on affordability — handily defeated the former governor in the Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor’s race is a signal moment for a Democratic Party looking for its way out of the political wilderness. Similar dynamics — progressives against moderates and insiders against outsiders — could play out in primary elections next spring. Democrats can also draw lessons from how questions of  support for Israel  have played in the race, and from Mamdani’s approach to social media and publicity, including appearing on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  Some national Democrats — most notably the party’s top two figures in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York — have been slow to embrace Mamdani. Jeffries  endorsed him  only in late October, and Schumer has not said who he is supporting in the mayor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  Before  heading out to rallies  in Virginia and New Jersey on Saturday, former President Barack Obama called Mamdani. He has not endorsed the nominee — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections — and that did not change in the call. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Across the Hudson River, voters in the traditionally blue state of New Jersey will choose their replacement for term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\n \n\n   \n  Amid tax hikes and soaring utility costs, affordability has taken center stage in the election. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican who is endorsed by Trump and has praised the president’s performance in his second term, has sought to localize the race —  pitching himself  as the consummate “Jersey guy” and casting Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who moved to the state after a Navy career, as an outsider.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill and Democrats, meanwhile, have emphasized Ciattarelli’s links to Trump — a potentially decisive factor in a state with 800,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. One point of emphasis: Trump’s cancellation of funding for the Gateway Tunnel, a rail project linking New Jersey and New York City.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey has typically leaned blue, but Ciattarelli came close to winning in 2021, and the state shifted hard in Trump’s direction in 2024: He lost by just 6 percentage points, after a 16-point drubbing there in 2020.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Four years after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won a major upset, tapping into parents’ anger over local school boards, his lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, is seeking to replace him with a campaign centered on transgender policies, particularly in schools.\n \n\n   \n  But polls suggest her Democratic opponent, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, has a clear advantage headed into Election Day in a state that three times voted against Trump. Democrats have relentlessly tied Earle-Sears to Trump, and she has not sought to distance herself from the president.\n \n\n   \n  At a rally with Obama in Norfolk on Saturday, Spanberger described the election as a chance for Democrats to send a signal to the nation. “Amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington, Virginia can and will flip statewide seats from red to blue,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  None of the states holding elections on Tuesday are typically considered swing states in presidential elections. But Republicans were able to sweep statewide races four years ago. And with the Virginia’s proximity to Washington, it is home to hundreds of thousands of federal government workers who are affected by the Trump administration’s downsizing of the federal workforce and the government shutdown. Its gubernatorial election might be the closest to a true test of Trump’s performance this year.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown closer races down ballot in Virginia, where Republican John Reid and Democrat Ghazala Hashmi are facing off for lieutenant governor. In the contest for attorney general, Republicans have what could be their best chance to win Tuesday as GOP incumbent Jason Miyares faces Democrat Jay Jones, who has been  dogged by controversy  surrounding violent text messages he sent in 2022.\n \n\n   \n    Issue to watch: Utility costs\n \n\n   \n  The economy is a perennial campaign issue, with voters often expressing concerns about prices at the grocery store or at gas pumps. This year’s pocketbook metric is one less often discussed:  utility costs .\n \n\n   \n  Electricity prices across the country, which have  sharply increased  since 2020, have jumped over the last year, introducing a new financial strain for voters in places like New Jersey and Virginia. Candidates in both states have featured energy costs in their television ads and campaign speeches.\n \n\n   \n  Utility costs have become a particularly salient issue in New Jersey, where residential electricity prices have jumped nearly 21% over the past year compared with a 6% increase nationwide, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Ciattarelli has said Democrats’ push for clean energy is to blame, while Sherrill has said she will fix the issue by freezing utility rates, a proposal that has drawn skepticism from Murphy, the outgoing Democratic governor.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump appears to be aware of the political potency of the issue. In a tele-rally for Ciattarelli last month, the president repeatedly turned to talking about energy costs — an indication the issue could be front and center in next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n    California’s redistricting battle\n \n\n   \n  California’s vote on  a measure known as Proposition 50  will set the stage for next year’s midterm battle for control of the US House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will decide whether to green-light the Democratic plan spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom to set aside the congressional districts drawn by the state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission in favor of a gerrymandered map aimed at improving Democrats’ chances of winning five GOP-held seats.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a response to Texas, where the legislature approved and Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law new maps intended to help Republicans win five more seats — improving the party’s odds of retaining its House majority.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, widely viewed as a 2028 presidential contender, sought an answer that would neutralize those Texas gains. But unlike in Texas, California voters have to sign off on the plan to replace the nonpartisan commission’s maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections — before switching back to new, commission-drawn maps in the next decade, after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  A “yes” vote would be a big win for Democrats, who have fewer avenues to respond after Republicans also redrew Missouri’s maps to add one more seat, with Indiana convening a special legislative session on Monday to potentially add one or two more GOP seats and North Carolina moving to add one more Republican-leaning district. It would also be a milestone for Newsom, as he and a slew of other Democratic governors seek to position themselves as Trump’s strongest opponents ahead of potential presidential runs.\n \n\n   \n    Pennsylvania Supreme Court retention\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, voters must determine whether to keep three Democratic members of the state Supreme Court — a decision with potentially  significant ramifications  in the coming months and years in the crucial presidential battleground.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have a 5-2 majority on the state’s high court. The three incumbents on Tuesday’s ballot face yes-or-no questions of whether they’ll be retained for new 10-year terms. If they aren’t, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro would appoint interim replacements until elections for new justices were held in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  A change in party control of the state Supreme Court could have far-reaching implications for the 2028 presidential race, upcoming midterms and future redistricting. Ahead of the 2020 and 2024 elections, the Democratic majority sided with Democrats on key cases related to mail-in deadlines, provisional ballots and signature matching.\n \n\n   \n    Texas House special election\n \n\n   \n  The largely Democratic, Houston-area 18th Congressional District in Texas has been without representation in Washington for most of the last 16 months.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024,  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee  died. Her daughter, Erica Lee Carter, won the special election to fill the vacancy. But that special election was held the same day as the 2024 general election, which was won by former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner — who hadn’t been on the ballot in the special election.\n \n\n   \n  Turner  died in early March . Abbott, a Republican, scheduled the special election for eight months later — a move that gave the House GOP more breathing room as it moved toward passage of Trump’s landmark tax and domestic policy bill.\n \n\n   \n  This special election, a jungle primary that will go to a runoff featuring the top two finishers unless one tops 50% of the vote on Tuesday, has drawn several high-profile candidates. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, who has technically resigned to run for Congress but continues to serve, is among the Democrats, as are state Rep. Jolanda Jones and Amanda Edwards, a former Houston City Council member who lost in the 2024 primary to Jackson Lee. Republican Carmen Montiel, a Venezuelan American real estate agent and former TV journalist, is the highest-profile member of her party in the race.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/trump-dilbert-scott-adams-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:48:00-05:00","title":"Trump says he is ‘on it’ after ‘Dilbert’ creator Scott Adams pleads for lifesaving help","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scott Adams, creator of the long-running comic strip 'Dilbert,' has publicly appealed for urgent medical help due to metastasized prostate cancer.

Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Trump appeared on “60 Minutes” Sunday night, one year after suing the CBS show over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview — and he was well aware that his answers would similarly be trimmed for time.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to use that one,” Trump remarked after an awkward exchange with interviewer Norah O’Donnell about crime in Washington, D.C.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you,” Trump said at another point while praising the new owners of CBS.\n \n\n   \n  The newsmagazine’s producers evidently agreed that those moments weren’t the most newsworthy. CBS News aired about a third of O’Donnell’s sit-down with Trump on TV, and posted  most of the rest  on YouTube. The network also published the complete transcript of the 90-minute interview online.\n \n\n   \n  Both the TV broadcast and the transcript showed that O’Donnell sought to make the most of her time with Trump, pressing him on cost-of-living increases, foreign policy challenges, the government shutdown and other topics.\n \n\n   \n  O’Donnell asked pointed questions: “Are we going to war against Venezuela?” “When will you declare ‘mission accomplished’ on immigration?” “So you’re gonna send the military into American cities?”\n \n\n   \n  During a couple of key moments, O’Donnell pushed back on Trump’s talking points, for example, noting how “when the stock market is doing well, that doesn’t affect everybody.”\n \n\n   \n  Liberal commentators criticized O’Donnell for not interjecting and correcting Trump more often — reprising a decade-old debate within media industry circles about how to interview Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Norah let Trump lie and lie with barely any pushback or provision of corrective facts,” former MSNBC host Joy Reid commented on Bluesky.\n \n\n   \n  But it was not exactly a cushy interview. And O’Donnell’s questions generated lots of news. In one clip that ricocheted around social media, Trump said immigration raids in the US “haven’t gone far enough.” In another viral clip, Trump said, “I don’t know who he is” when asked about Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, whom  he pardoned last month .\n \n\n   \n  Trump seemingly had little to say when O’Donnell brought up “those that are suffering with cost-of-living increases and saying they’re living paycheck to paycheck.” He suggested people should blame his predecessor, Joe Biden, and made generic pledges about lowering the price of gas and fixing healthcare.\n \n\n   \n  “But Mr. President, with all due respect, you’ve been talking about fixing the healthcare insurance plan since 2015,” O’Donnell said at one point.\n \n\n   \n  “Sure. And you can’t do it because of the Democrats,” Trump responded.\n \n\n   \n    Praising David Ellison and Bari Weiss\n \n\n   \n  Sit-down interviews with Trump have been few and far between during his second term, so every question and every answer gets attention.\n \n\n   \n  And Sunday’s “60 Minutes” interview was even more noteworthy since Trump cares deeply about the newsmagazine but hadn’t said yes to an interview since 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Trump fielded O’Donnell’s questions on Friday, one year to the day after he filed a frivolous lawsuit against “60 Minutes” over its pre-election interview with Harris.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit — along with Trump’s public attacks and threats against CBS station licenses — shook the network and created a conundrum for parent company Paramount, which needed the Trump administration’s approval for its then-pending merger with Skydance Media.\n \n\n   \n  The Paramount board decided to strike a settlement deal, paying $16 million to Trump’s future presidential library to end the litigation.\n \n\n   \n  The settlement was widely criticized, including by journalists and entertainers at CBS. “The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert likened it to a “big fat bribe.” (Colbert’s show was cancelled soon thereafter, in  what the network cast  as a financial, not political, decision.)\n \n\n   \n  Within days of the settlement being finalized last July, the Trump administration approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance Media, clearing the way for Skydance boss David Ellison, son of the Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, to take control of CBS.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has kept tabs on the Paramount ownership change and has expressed hope that CBS will be “fairer” as a result.\n \n\n   \n  “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They’re friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine,” Trump said last month. “They will make the right decisions,” he added. “They’re going to revitalize CBS — hopefully, they’ll bring it back to its former glory.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also flattered the Ellisons during the “60 Minutes” taping, saying, “I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump specifically brought up David Ellison’s recent hiring of Bari Weiss as CBS News editor-in-chief, albeit not by name.\n \n\n   \n  “The young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great — from what I know. I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person,” Trump said after bringing up the Paramount settlement. (This is one of the parts of the interview that Trump suggested could be trimmed.)\n \n\n   \n  Trump falsely said “60 Minutes” was “forced to pay me a lot of money,” when in fact the settlement was a corporate calculation; CBS could have decided to fight the lawsuit in court, and many legal experts believed the network would have won.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also misstated the timeline, claiming the Harris interview “was election-changing, two nights before the election,” when in fact it aired one month before election day.\n \n\n   \n  CBS disclosed the settlement controversy in O’Donnell’s introduction to the interview broadcast on Sunday night. She noted that “the settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/sport/india-cricket-womenn-world-cup-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:51:00-05:00","title":"India wins Women’s Cricket World Cup for first time","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India made history by winning its first Women’s Cricket World Cup title in a 52-run victory over South Africa on November 2, 2025, in a match delayed by rain.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  India won the Women’s Cricket World Cup for the first time with a 52-run victory over South Africa on Sunday, led by brilliant all-round performances from Deepti Sharma and Shafali Verma.\n \n\n   \n  Opening batter Verma, who was only called back into the squad as injury cover for the finals, scored a career-best 87 off 78 balls as the tournament co-host reached 298-7 in 50 overs after losing the toss and being sent in to bat.\n \n\n   \n  South Africa was out for 246 in 45.3 overs in reply with its chase effectively over after skipper Laura Wolvaardt was out for 101. Spinner Sharma took the final wicket of the match and returned bowling figures of 5-39 from 9.3 overs.\n \n\n   \n  “We were waiting for this moment, and now this moment has come,” India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said, reflecting on a triumph after two previous finals defeats. “Now we want to make this a habit.”\n \n\n   \n  India was the last of the four teams to qualify for the semifinals, but then beat defending champion and seven-time winner Australia by five wickets to reach the final. South Africa beat four-time champion England by 125 runs to reach the final for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  Winning at home gave India its first major women’s cricket title. Harmanpreet Kaur’s squad was the first, first-time champion since 2000, when New Zealand ended the long dominance of Australia and England.\n \n\n   \n    Player of the match\n \n\n   \n  Verma - who was drafted in last week for the injured Pratika Rawal - took 2-36 with the ball and was voted player of the match.\n \n\n   \n  “God sent me to do something good, and that was reflected today,” the 21-year-old Verma said. “I only focused on making runs today. My mind was clear.”\n \n\n   \n  Before her five-wicket haul, Sharma (58) posted her third half-century of the tournament to help India reached the second highest total in a World Cup final after Australia’s 356-5 against England in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  She finished the tournament with 22 wickets and 215 runs in nine matches to capture the player of the tournament honors.\n \n\n   \n  “I enjoyed myself with both bat and ball,” Sharma said of the final. “We were not relaxed at any time, but we were calm. I dedicate this trophy to my parents.”\n \n\n   \n  Wolvaardt a fine century on the back of her impressive semifinal performance. She was easily the tournament’s highest scorer with 571 runs at an average 71.37.\n \n\n   \n  Chasing a record 299, South Africa made a sedate start under immense pressure from medium pacer Renuka Singh.\n \n\n   \n    C.H.A.M.P.I.O.N.S.\n \n\n   \n  Wolvaardt shared a 51-run first-wicket stand before a direct throw from Amanjot Kaur ran out and Tazmin Brits for 23 in the 10th over.\n \n\n   \n  Anneke Bosche was bowled for a duck before Wolvaardt reached her half-century off 45 balls. She added 52 off 51 balls with Sune Luus, who scored 25.\n \n\n   \n  India lost its review in desperation to get Wolvaardt dismissed, and then gambled with Verma’s gentle off-breakers.\n \n\n   \n  The ploy worked with another double blow - Verma picked up two wickets in six deliveries to have South Africa in trouble at 123-4 in 22.1 overs. She sent back Luus with an easy return catch, and then had Marizanne Kapp (4) caught behind.\n \n\n   \n  Wolvaardt tried to keep the chase alive through partnerships with Sinalo Jafta (16) and Annerie Dercksen, who scored 35. In doing so, she reached a century off 96 balls.\n \n\n   \n  Sharma bowled Dercksen and then blunted South Africa’s chances when she Wolvaardt caught by Kaur in the 42nd over with the total at 220-7.\n \n\n   \n  Verma played a key role in setting the Proteas a challenging target after the final was delayed by two hours because of rain.\n \n\n   \n  She hit seven fours and two sixes and shared a 104-run opening stand with Smriti Mandhana (45).\n \n\n   \n  After Chloe Tryon dismissed Mandhana in the 18th over, Verma combined with Jemimah Rodrigues (24) to add a further 62 before both were out.\n \n\n   \n  From 171-3 in 29.4 overs, skipper Harmanpreet tried to restore the momentum but was bowled by Nonkululeko Mlaba in the 39th over. She scored only 20 runs, but combined with Sharma for 52 runs off 56 balls.\n \n\n   \n  Sharma steadied the innings with a run-a-ball 58, including three fours and a six and shared a pivotal 47-run, sixth-wicket partnership with Richa Ghosh that helped set up the winning total.\n \n\n   \n  The Board of Control for Cricket in India punctuated the tournament with a social media post to reflect the historic victory, topping the congratulatory message with the letters: C.H.A.M.P.I.O.N.S.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/evanston-border-patrol-arrests-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:10:00-05:00","title":"Evanston Mayor Opens Investigations After Federal Agents Filmed Punching Man During Arrest","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Evanston, Illinois, a video of federal agents allegedly punching a man during an immigration enforcement operation sparked public outrage.

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the agents were conducting an immigration enforcement operation at the time. It said agents had observed a “red vehicle” that was “aggressively” tailing their vehicle, and when the agents turned, the car crashed into Border Patrol. DHS said a “hostile crowd” gathered around their vehicle and began “verbally abusing them and spitting on them.”\n \n\n   \n  But Mayor Daniel Biss disputed the agency’s account of the incident in an interview with CNN, calling DHS “a bunch of liars.”\n \n\n   \n  He told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday he is opening two investigations into the incident: one into the “violence” federal agents used against people he described as “innocent bystanders,” and one into the vehicle collision. The Border Patrol agents “deliberately caused a car accident” by intentionally braking while being followed by the red vehicle, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t like being followed, because they don’t like being watched, because they don’t want the world to know what they’re doing,” said the mayor of the Chicago suburb. “They forced this car accident, and then they started literally beating up innocent bystanders.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has asked DHS about the mayor’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  The incident comes amid growing scrutiny of  the aggressive tactics  used by Border Patrol and ICE, including against US citizens. Multiple people have been  shot by federal agents  during immigration enforcement operations, and  multiple car crashes  and alleged “rammings” involving federal agents have occurred as DHS sets out to meet  high arrest targets  set by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said three US citizens were arrested “as a result of their violence against law enforcement” in Evanston on Friday, but the agency did not specify what the three had allegedly done, and did not identify them or list any charges against them.\n \n\n   \n  In response to CNN’s questions about the videos showing the man being punched in the head, a DHS spokesperson sent a statement saying a Border Patrol agent had “delivered several defensive strikes” to a person he was arresting. The statement said the man had kicked the agent and “grabbed the (agent’s) genitals and squeezed them” during the arrest, but that account was not readily supported by the video.\n \n\n   \n  Video shows one agent restraining the man, then dragging him around as another agent helps pin him to the ground. As one agent punches the man several times, the man screams, “Help me, help me.” Agents appear to fight off a screaming crowd trying to help the man by pushing them away and threatening them with pepper spray.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t breathe,” the man says as the agent continues to kneel on him. The agents then drag him into a vehicle, his left shoe lying on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  Biss said that after the man was arrested, federal agents “took him away and booked him and drove him around” but did not take him to receive medical care. The man was “not in good shape” after the arrest, he said. CNN has asked DHS whether it took the man to receive medical care.\n \n\n   \n  “This is lawlessness,” the mayor said. “This is an outrage, and everyone’s got to stand up against it.”\n \n\n   \n  By arresting three US citizens, he said, federal agents “weren’t even trying to enforce immigration. They were just trying to go after dissent.”\n \n\n   \n  Following a new Evanston policy, local police obtained the badge numbers of the federal agents involved in Friday’s arrests, Biss said. “Now we have the first step toward accountability, by being able to identify them,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  City officials are “thinking through options, including going to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, or potentially communicating with our state’s attorney to figure out the right way to demand justice for our residents who were assaulted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker  had asked  federal officials to pause immigration enforcement operation in and near homes, schools, parks and other areas where families would be celebrating Halloween over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Wymer, who took videos of the incident, described the agents’ actions as “absolutely deplorable.”\n \n\n   \n  “These agents chose to terrorize our neighborhood on Halloween, a day that is supposed to be special and fun for families,” Wymer said. “This is not normal. This is not OK, and our town will stand with our immigrant neighbors no matter what.”\n \n\n   \n  Five people from Mexico were arrested Friday in Evanston and the neighboring city of Skokie, DHS told CNN. The agency did not specify the reason for each arrest but listed trespassing and entering the United States without authorization, a civil immigration offense.\n \n\n   \n  Local and state officials criticized the immigration operation in the area Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m disgusted and outraged by reports of ICE terrorizing students, families, and community members today in Evanston, Skokie, and across the 9th District,” US Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat,  said on X.  “My team and I are monitoring the situation and coordinating with local partners to protect our neighbors. We won’t tolerate this inhumanity and will defend the dignity of every person in our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN on Friday, Biss had a clear message for federal officials: “To Gregory Bovino, Kristi Noem, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection: Get the hell out of our city.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/hegseth-bars-military-officials-from-discussing-drug-boat-strikes-with-congress-without-prior-approval","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"16:51:00Z","title":"Hegseth Bars Military Officials from Discussing Drug Boat Strikes with Congress Without Prior Approval","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has issued a new policy requiring Defense Department personnel to seek prior approval from his office before discussing sensitive military operations — including strikes on suspected drug boats in Latin America — with Congress.

This review is for processes internal to the Department and does not change how or from whom Congress receives information,” said Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesman.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Rep. Don Bacon said on Saturday the policy amounted to “another amateur move” by the secretary that was resulting in military members being “afraid to communicate” with lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a five-time commander & our leadership WANTED us to engage members of Congress,” he  posted  on X. “We wanted to share what our great airmen were doing. We were proud of our service. The new rules have put a large barrier between the military & Congress. Pentagon says the change is very small. But I already see the impact with military members being afraid to communicate. This is another amateur move.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest guidance also comes as Congress has become increasingly frustrated with the lack of answers from the Pentagon on the US military’s operations in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said. Democrats left a briefing on Thursday furious that Defense Department lawyers  hadn’t been present  to answer basic questions about the legal justification for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth,  whose tenure  has been beleaguered by leaks, has taken a number of steps to more tighly control information since earlier this year, including barring most engagements between DoD personnel and think tanks, reporters, or other outside events and conferences.

Elliot Gaiser, told select Senate and House lawmakers on Thursday that the US strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean did not trigger the law’s requirements because they don’t meet the definition of hostilities and did not require a declaration of war from Congress, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Gaiser was drawing on a classified legal opinion produced by his office that justifies the strikes by equating drug cartels with terrorists and focuses on the death caused by the drugs brought to American shores, the sources said. Gaiser emphasized the fact that the US military wasn’t being attacked in response to the strikes as part his argument that America was not at war, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has carried out at least 15 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels since early September, killing a total of 64 people, according to a CNN tally. The latest known strike  occurred  on Saturday in the Caribbean, killing three people.\n \n\n   \n  Some legal experts have said the military strikes could violate US and international law.  Democratic lawmakers , and at least  one Republican , have criticized the administration for not being more forthcoming with details on the legal justification for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration notified Congress in early September that it had struck an alleged drug vessel. Under the 1973 War Powers Resolution, that notification started a 60-day clock, after which the administration has to either cease the use of military force, get an extension on the clock or a war authorization from Congress,  according  to legal scholars.\n \n\n   \n  But Gaiser told lawmakers that the administration does not need to seek an extension of that 60-day clock, which expires on Monday, because the law doesn’t apply in this case, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN  first reported  on the existence of the OLC opinion, which legal experts said appears to justify an open-ended war against a secret list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers. The opinion appears designed to give the president power to designate drug traffickers as enemy combatants and have them summarily killed without legal review, those experts said. Historically, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has requested comment from the White House and the Justice Department on the congressional briefings and the administration’s legal rationale for striking the alleged drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Post first  reported  on Gaiser’s briefing of lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump issued an executive order on the first day of his second term designating certain drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, giving the US military greater leeway to attack them. The administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats have coincided with increased pressure on the regime of Venezuelan autocrat Nicolás Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, though he has not yet made a decision on whether to move forward with them, CNN  reported  last month.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/terror-attack-plot-michigan-arrests","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"What We Know and Don’t Know About the Alleged Terror Plot Thwarted by FBI in Michigan","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI in Michigan thwarted a potential terrorist attack linked to Halloween weekend, following online discussions about an ISIS-inspired attack and activities at a shooting range involving high-speed reloads with AK-47s.

A shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s.\n \n\n   \n  A  potential terrorist attack over Halloween weekend  was thwarted by the FBI, according to a social media post by agency Director Kash Patel.\n \n\n   \n  Details of the alleged plot are scarce but two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case told CNN about the “pumpkin day” reference, the online chat and the shooting range activity.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know and don’t know about the potential terror attack:\n \n\n   \n    Two arrests, and others being questioned\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others were being questioned, according to two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case. Their ages range from 16 to 20s.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Amir Makled, who represents one of the adults in custody, told CNN Sunday that three people have been arrested, two were questioned and an additional two people were questioned and released. CNN has reached out to the FBI for clarification.\n \n\n   \n  Patel  wrote on X  the FBI “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  “The FBI swept out from the Detroit field office last night and through this morning, taking people into custody, executing search warrants and doing subpoenas for phones, computers and other material,” John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Makled urged people to wait for “verifiable facts” before jumping to conclusions. His client, a 20-year-old US citizen who has not been publicly identified, is cooperating with authorities and has not been formally charged, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney said he is concerned about “rhetoric that’s harmful to the large Arab and Muslim population in the state of Michigan, specifically in Dearborn” since reports of the alleged plot emerged.\n \n\n   \n  Laraib Irfan said he woke up to what he described as loud bangs from “smoke bombs” in the predawn and saw FBI agents outside his neighbor’s house two doors down on their quiet Dearborn street. He said he is “close” to the family that lives in the home and is “just trying to find answers” about what happened. Some occupants of the home were handcuffed outside.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re like family. They’re like friends. We’re always talking with each other,” he said of the neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t believe that something like that would even go down on my block,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    How the alleged plot was uncovered\n \n\n   \n  The ISIS-inspired plot unfolded in online chatrooms, according to the two law enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  An FBI undercover person was introduced into the chatroom in the early stages of discussion, the officials added.\n \n\n   \n  “This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” said Miller, citing conversations with law enforcement officials who had been briefed.\n \n\n   \n  The participants discussed whether to carry out an ISIS-inspired plot in the US – “though what that plot was, when that plot would be, what the target would be, was unclear as they discussed various options in terms of timing,” Miller said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what the two people arrested were charged with and whether charges have been filed.\n \n\n   \n  Miller said the FBI moved in this week when a group of people who were being monitored “went to a shooting range with AK-47s and other weapons, fired a large number of rounds of ammunition, practiced tactical high-speed reloads, and in the discussions it was picked up a reference to what we’re told is ‘pumpkin day’ – a possible reference to Halloween.”\n \n\n   \n  The individuals taken into custody had discussed in their communications whether they were ready to carry out an attack, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said. Some said they needed more time and training, but a younger member of the group had said that it was time to act, two officials added.\n \n\n   \n  There was also a discussion at one point about taking a one-day trip to New York City to see the sights, including visiting Rockefeller Center and looking at the Statue of Liberty, the officials said. There was no talk about the trip being a reconnaissance for an attack, but the conversation caught the attention of both the FBI and the NYPD as the investigation continued.\n \n\n   \n    ‘No current threat to public safety’\n \n\n   \n  The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed “the FBI in Michigan were present in the cities of Dearborn and Inkster … conducting law enforcement activities,” spokesperson Jordan Hall told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no current threat to public safety.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dearborn Police Department said it “has been made aware that the FBI conducted operations in the City of Dearborn.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to assure our residents that there is no threat to the community at this time,” the police department said.\n \n\n   \n  In the city of Inkster, the FBI carried out “law enforcement activities at a storage facility located on Michigan Avenue,” Police Chief Tamika L. Jenkins said.\n \n\n   \n  She said local FBI agents confirmed there is no threat to residents. But to assuage any concerns, Inkster police “will have additional personnel deployed throughout the evening to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, particularly those participating in Halloween festivities,” the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the FBI and Michigan State Police.\n \n\n   \n  “I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” she posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/europe/italian-alps-avalanche-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Five German climbers killed in Italian Alps avalanche","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five German climbers died in an avalanche on their way to the summit of Cima Vertana in the Ortler mountain range near Solda, Italy.

    1:02 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A well-armed jihadist group affiliated with al Qaeda is closing in on Bamako, the capital of Mali. The country’s military junta and their Russian partners are struggling to counter the jihadis, who now hold sway in many parts of the huge Sahelian country.\n \n\n   \n    What’s happening now\n \n\n   \n  Fuel is running short in Bamako as militants belonging to a group called Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam al-Muslimin (JNIM) cut roads to the capital, attack military patrols and ambush tanker trucks.\n \n\n   \n  As the situation deteriorates, the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany among others have urged their nationals to leave Bamako. On Thursday, the UK warned its citizens to “leave immediately by commercial flight if you judge it safe to do so,” while the  US State Department  cited the “unpredictability of Bamako’s security situation” in encouraging Americans to leave.\n \n\n   \n  Video and images from the city in recent days show long lines of motorbikes and other vehicles queuing at gas stations. Some residents have accused the police of sequestering fuel supplies, according to local media. Schools and colleges closed because of the shortages.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two months, JNIM has stepped up attacks on fuel supplies, ambushing tankers on the roads from Ivory Coast and Senegal.\n \n\n   \n  In one attack in mid-September, the militants attacked a convoy of more than 100 fuel trucks, setting fire to half of them, according to Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which maps conflicts.\n \n\n   \n  The militants have seized large amounts of weaponry from government forces and demonstrated their ability to use drones, says the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), which analyzes terrorist groups.\n \n\n   \n  JNIM “has diversified its tactics” terrorism analyst Daniele Garofalo told CNN, stepping up its “economic warfare campaigns with roadblocks, extortion/taxation and fuel blockades.”\n \n\n   \n  In a video released last month, JNIM spokesman Abu Hudheifa al-Bambari demanded people cooperate in areas controlled by the group by stopping at its checkpoints and advised them to avoid traveling with military convoys.\n \n\n   \n  Government forces have increased patrols and carried out helicopter attacks, claiming to have killed dozens of militants. But the attacks continue, extending fuel shortages to large swathes of central and southern Mali and isolating garrisons of government forces.\n \n\n   \n    How did we get here?\n \n\n   \n  JNIM has long been active in Mali, a French colony until it gained independence in 1960, and other parts of the Sahel, especially in neighboring Burkina Faso. It was formed in 2017 as a coalition of jihadist factions and immediately declared its allegiance to al Qaeda. It has grown in strength in recent years, bringing instability to much of central and western Mali.\n \n\n   \n  This summer it embarked on a campaign of economic warfare in western Mali. It has “attacked factories, industrial facilities, infrastructure projects and artisanal gold mining sites,” according to Garofalo.\n \n\n   \n  “JNIM has demonstrated a new level of coordination, conducting operations hundreds of kilometers apart,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Russian mercenaries have deployed to Mali for counterterrorism missions since 2021, first as part of the Wagner Group and now as what Moscow calls the Africa Corps. But they have been unable to stem the militants’ advance and have suffered extensive casualties.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, JNIM claimed that a “complex ambush” had wiped out a convoy of Russian contractors and Malian soldiers in the north of the country, killing 50 Russians.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian presence appears to have alienated large sections of Mali’s population. A recent Human Rights Watch  report  said the junta and its Russian backers “have committed dozens of summary executions and enforced disappearances of ethnic Fulani men … whom they accuse of collaborating with the JNIM.”\n \n\n   \n    What are the implications for the wider region?\n \n\n   \n  Mali and its neighbors – especially Burkina Faso and Niger – have all seen chronic volatility in recent years. JNIM and other militant groups are active in all three countries. In July alone, JNIM claimed 54 attacks in Burkina Faso, 36 in Mali and seven in Niger.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, JNIM claimed its first attack in northern Nigeria, which is also wracked by militant violence.\n \n\n   \n  Many analysts believe that another coup in Mali, or the collapse of the current regime led by Assimi Goïta, would further destabilize the Sahel, allowing militant groups to expand operations.\n \n\n   \n  JNIM has “increasingly integrated into the region’s illicit economies by exploiting fuel and arms smuggling routes in the tri-border area between Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Ghana,” according to the CEP.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a conflict amid the fluid borders between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso and there is also a risk of contagion to other states – northwest Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire for example,” said Edmund Fitton-Brown, a former coordinator of the UN Sanctions Monitoring Team and now a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, based in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  But Burkina Faso is most at risk, with a fragile military regime that has no writ beyond the capital. “The contagion spreading to Burkina Faso is all but a certainty,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    What might happen next?\n \n\n   \n  There is no sign of the militants preparing for a frontal attack on Bamako. Their strategy seems to be to strangle the capital and provoke unrest against the military junta.\n \n\n   \n  While the Malian army moves slowly and predictably, JNIM militants blend into local communities and get to know their surroundings.\n \n\n   \n  “JNIM has become very adept at conveying the discontent and demands of the poorer sections of the population and ethnic minorities,” said Garofalo, who believes its objective seems to be more about presenting itself as a better government.\n \n\n   \n  It now has the capacity “to create prolonged crises, disrupt supplies, target secondary centrers and influence public opinion, thereby putting serious pressure on an already politically fragile junta,” Garofalo added.\n \n\n   \n  “However, turning this pressure into the fall or replacement of the regime would require seriously escalating operations that have so far been sporadic. JNIM is focusing on systemic weakening and the junta’s loss of local control.”\n \n\n   \n  So far it has been succeeding. While JNIM’s ultimate intentions remain unclear, “Mali could become the first country ruled by (al Qaeda) in its four-decade history,” according to the CEP.\n \n\n   \n  Fitton-Brown said the junta in Bamako won’t get any support from outside. They “essentially evicted the French and fell out with both the UN and the regional force ECOWAS. The Russians were never going to be an alternative.”\n \n\n   \n  “JNIM will eventually insist on a government more to their liking in Bamako, even if they don’t take control themselves and accept something softer than an al Qaeda affiliated regime,” Fitton Brown added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/ice-protest-arrests-illinois","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Protesters Arrested at Chicago ICE Facility Amid Escalating Tensions Over Free Speech and Enforcement Tactics","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Since September 2025, weekly protests have taken place outside the Broadview ICE facility in Chicago, driven by opposition to President Donald Trump's intensified immigration enforcement campaign.

outside of Chicago. Here’s what happened to them next \n       \n  By Nicquel Terry Ellis, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As demonstrations outside an immigration enforcement facility near Chicago have ramped up over the past couple of months, so has the number of protesters being led away in restraints and facing a court date.\n \n\n   \n  Since September, protesters have rallied weekly outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview against President Donald Trump’s  intensified immigration enforcement campaign  in Chicago. Early on, federal agents guarding the building  deployed tear gas and shot pepper balls in clashes with protesters  and arrested some of them, including some  charged with felonies  on suspicion of assaulting or  blocking  officers.\n \n\n   \n  But by early October, state, county and local law enforcement officers  took a larger role  in policing the protests at the facility. These agencies have made 68 arrests in connection with Broadview protests since October 3, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said on October 28.\n \n\n   \n  The arrests sometimes expose a tension between demonstrators’ desire to exercise their constitutional free speech rights and the intention of authorities – who say some protesters have resisted their attempts to keep paths to the building clear – to let ICE agents and others travel safely to and from the facility.\n \n\n   \n  CNN talked to some arrested demonstrators or, in one case, a protester’s representative, to ask about their experiences in getting arrested on accusations ranging from petty to felony offenses. Here are their stories.\n \n\n   \n    Chicago woman held for hours after a crowd scuffle with police\n \n\n   \n  A’Keisha Lee was standing and chanting with a crowd of protesters near the Broadview ICE facility on October 17 when she saw a swarm of police officers hop out of police vans wearing helmets and carrying batons, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I was sickened,” the 30-year-old Chicago resident recalled. “And I remember feeling really scared.”\n \n\n   \n  The officers walked toward her and the other demonstrators in a “militarized fashion” and began pushing them back, she said. Video of the encounter shows Lee at the front of the crowd when officers with Illinois State Police patches on their sleeves pushed in an apparent attempt to clear them from a paved area, and some demonstrators tried to hold their ground.\n \n\n   \n  Chaos ensued. There was yelling, people falling, and some who appeared to get hurt in the scuffle, Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  She was hit in the face with a baton, and wasn’t sure whether the strike was intentional, she recounted. She’d later discover a bruise on her face.\n \n\n   \n  Lee fell to the ground, and officers helped her up, according to Lee and the video, which was distributed by Reuters. An officer then detained her, putting zip ties around her wrists, she said; that moment is not shown in the Reuters video. Lee couldn’t understand why she was being arrested.\n \n\n   \n  “I was asking them to let me go,” Lee said, “and reinforcing that I hadn’t did anything I wasn’t allowed to do.”\n \n\n   \n  She was escorted to a curb to sit, and moments later placed in a police vehicle that took her to the Broadview Police Department. Lee’s mind raced as she rode in the police car. She worried about going to jail and whether the conditions would be clean and safe. She also worried about whether she’d be treated differently as a Black woman in the legal system.\n \n\n   \n  At the police station, she was booked, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a holding cell with other female protesters for about five hours before being released.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police had arrested her on two Class A misdemeanor counts of resisting a police officer – punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500 – Cook County court records show. She also was cited on suspicion of disobeying a police officer, a petty offense that carries a fine. Her court appearance is scheduled for November 25.\n \n\n   \n  The court documents do not offer details about what led to the arrest, but Lee denies resisting and says it was never made clear to her how she was disobeying police.\n \n\n   \n  “From my understanding, it was in my rights to be there,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police did not directly answer CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including Lee’s assertion that she did nothing wrong or why officers pushed back this crowd. However, they did issue a statement generally addressing the approach of the state, county and local officers who’ve been policing the protests since early October – a group they call the “Unified Command.”\n \n\n   \n  These officers in Broadview “give loud, clear, consistent, and repeated directions and commands to crowds and provide individuals numerous opportunities to comply with the law,” state police said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to note that since the establishment of the Unified Command, there have been no violent confrontations between ICE and protesters in Broadview involving the use of chemical agents, which is a significant departure from operations prior to their presence,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  Lee has protested at the Broadview ICE facility on several recent Fridays, taking issue with how ICE is picking up allegedly undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, and how federal agents are  deploying tear gas  during protests in neighborhoods.\n \n\n   \n  “I think how this country has treated immigrants is one of our original transgressions,” Lee said. “And this is the first tester for what we will allow as a people.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee, who works for a local nonprofit, worries about the fate of her court case; however, she stands by her decision to protest.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s always a fear of being treated like an example when these things happen,” Lee said. “But I do believe that I did not break the law.”\n \n\n   \n    He was arrested while trying to enter the ICE facility\n \n\n   \n  Sean Mills says he is not happy about how immigrants have been treated since the Trump administration started aggressively cracking down on illegal immigration earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  To voice his frustrations, Mills, 37, of Chicago, has become a weekly demonstrator at the Broadview ICE facility. He shows up every Friday and Saturday – sometimes wearing an American flag draped around his shoulders – and joins other protesters outside the facility.   \n \n\n   \n  But on October 17, Mills was arrested for the first time in his life, he said, after he tried to enter the building. Mills had become increasingly concerned with  claims by local activists  that the facility’s conditions were inhumane. So, Mills wanted to view the building’s interior himself.\n \n\n   \n  “I just had the urge to walk over and test my luck,” Mills said. “I walked over to see if I could investigate as a citizen and enter the facility to ask questions and document.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers surrounded Mills near the facility’s entrance, and one told him he was not allowed inside, Mills said. That same officer told Mills to “go back immediately” or be arrested, according to Mills.   \n \n\n   \n  “I tried to explain myself a little bit further,” Mills said, adding he told the officers he was a concerned citizen who wanted to go inside. “And I think about five or 10 seconds later, he (the officer) said ‘OK, you’re under arrest.’”\n \n\n   \n  Mills was shocked because he didn’t believe he had done anything wrong. He also felt the officers had not given him enough time to explain himself before restraining his hands with what he believes were zip ties.\n \n\n   \n  Three other protesters who also were trying to enter the building were arrested, he recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s just an over-policing example, because I walked up there with my hands out to my side, declared myself very openly, and said I’d like to enter the facility,” Mills said. “One hundred percent it was just to show an example of us.”\n \n\n   \n  Mills was escorted to a nearby curb, where he waited roughly 10 minutes for a police van that took him to the Broadview police station, where he was processed and given a citation, he recounted.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police cited him on suspicion of disobeying a police officer – a petty offense punishable by a fine – Cook County court records show, and is scheduled to appear in court November 25.\n \n\n   \n  The court documents do not offer a narrative of the arrest. State police did not directly respond to CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including about Mills’ claim that he did nothing wrong. Instead, they provided the same general statement they gave for Lee’s arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Mills has no regrets protesting and getting arrested because he’s standing up for his beliefs.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a shame that us peaceful protesters are being targeted instead of being encouraged to exercise our First Amendment rights,” Mills said.\n \n\n   \n  Mills objects to law enforcement officers being able to stop and ask people about their immigration status based at least in part on their  apparent ethnicity . A US Supreme Court ruling in a California case last month  appeared to clear the way  for a person’s ethnicity to be a  factor  behind immigration stops by law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Mills also does not support ICE’s roundups throughout Chicago of people accused of being in the country illegally.\n \n\n   \n  “We are doing the least that we can do to keep our neighbors safe, which is so important to us right now,” Mills said.\n \n\n   \n    School cafeteria worker tackled after threatening agents, authorities say\n \n\n   \n  Paul Ivery is a Chicago-area man with an intellectual disability who works at a high school cafeteria and admires and respects the police and first responders in his community – even saluting officers when he passes them – people who know him say.\n \n\n   \n  So it may have surprised acquaintances that for two weeks, he faced a felony charge of assaulting a federal officer at a protest at the ICE facility in Broadview.\n \n\n   \n  The case would draw numerous supporters, including his own mayor, to one of Ivery’s court hearings in an attempt to persuade a judge he wasn’t a threat. Ivery declined to be interviewed for this story, but a family representative, court filings and bystander video help chronicle a case that the government wanted prosecuted one moment but dismissed the next.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery walked from his home in Oak Park to the Broadview ICE facility on September 27 to join the demonstrations, family spokesperson Scott Sakiwama said.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery would later tell investigators he was there to “protest against ICE” because he believed that “ICE agents were disrespectful towards the Broadview Police Department and veterans,”  a criminal complaint filed against Ivery in federal court said,  without elaborating on his motivation.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was also upset that federal agents had been  deploying tear gas and shooting pepper balls at protesters  at Broadview, according to Sakiwama.\n \n\n   \n  At some point during the protest, Ivery approached a US Border Patrol agent and shouted something at him, according to the  complaint . While the agent couldn’t recall what was said, Ivery would admit to investigators later that he said, “I’ll (expletive) kill you right now,” and, “do something,” according to the document.\n \n\n   \n  After the shout, Ivery ran and jumped on top of an occupied vehicle as agents chased him, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Video from a bystander shows Ivery jumping off the vehicle, and an agent tackling him as he hits the pavement. Ivery yells as several agents restrain him. Nearby, other agents fire chemical irritants into the ground to keep bystanders away, appearing to cause some people to cough, the video shows . \n \n\n   \n  An onlooker asks Ivery for his name. Ivery yells it and says, “Help me!” Minutes later, after agents tied his hands behind his back and sat him up, an agent helps Ivery drink from a water bottle. Ivery is eventually pulled to his feet and led into the back of an unmarked vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  The complaint alleges that as agents were restraining Ivery, he grabbed an agent’s helmet and pulled it down, hurting the agent’s chin and exposing the agent to pepper spray.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was arrested and  charged  in federal court with felony assault on a federal officer, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was temporarily held at the Broadview ICE facility on the day of his arrest and transferred to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago that evening, Sakiwama said.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was held for several days. But by October 1, prosecutors asked to have him released from jail and put on house arrest pending trial, acknowledging his disability,  CNN affiliate WLS-TV reported .\n \n\n   \n  At a hearing that day, a judge released Ivery on his own recognizance. Many of Ivery’s supporters, including Oak Park Mayor Vicki Scaman, were there to back him,  according to WLS .\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to the judge, Scaman said Ivery is a “valued member of our community” who stops and salutes police when he sees them on the street. She wrote that Ivery is not a threat to the community, and she hoped the judge would consider Ivery’s “special needs diagnosis.”\n \n\n   \n  On October 9, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charge altogether, and the judge ordered the dismissal the next day. The court records did not say why the case was dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  The US attorney’s office for Illinois’ northern district did not respond to CNN’s request for information about the dismissal. Ivery’s court-appointed attorney declined to be interviewed about the specifics of the case.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy for Mr. Ivery and the just resolution of his case and hope that others who are also having their First Amendment rights trampled by the government receive justice as well,” Ivery’s attorney and federal public defender Johanathan Brooks said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Bill Kirkos and Caroll Alvarado contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/shutdown-native-communities","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"12:11:00-13:00","title":"Native American Leaders Warn of Deepening Crisis Amid Government Shutdown and Federal Layoffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Native American leaders are warning that mass federal layoffs and benefit delays during a government shutdown are severely worsening conditions in tribal communities.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:11 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Native American leaders warned senators last week that mass layoffs and potential benefit lapses are making this government shutdown more painful for their communities and insisted that the federal government fulfill its treaty obligations with tribal nations.\n \n\n   \n  “The shutdown reductions in force have crept into our classrooms, our early childhood programs and our homes. What began as a budget dispute in Washington has become a daily crisis in Indian country,” Kerry Bird, ﻿president of the board of directors of the National Indian Education Association, told senators during a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Bird and other witnesses were invited by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to testify about how layoffs, also called reductions in force or RIFs, and the shutdown have affected their communities. They emphasized that in reducing the number of the federal employees who interface often with tribes, especially on issues of education, economic development, health and food security, the administration has left Native communities isolated and unsupported at a time when many federal benefits like SNAP are delayed.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who has long been critical of the Trump administration’s mass layoffs, chaired the hearing, and was the only Republican in attendance.\n \n\n   \n  “The loss of employees with deep institutional knowledge and long standing relationships with Native communities, weakens the effectiveness of these crucial federal programs,” Murkowski said as the hearing opened.\n \n\n   \n  As the hearing began, Bird told senators that he had just been told that seven of nine employees at the Office of Indian Education under the Department of Education had been laid off.\n \n\n   \n  “That means no one to process grants, approved budgets or support in tribal education departments and Indian parent committees. If these terminations are allowed to go into full effect, Indian education programs as we know them would be functionally eliminated,” said Bird.\n \n\n   \n  “When our ancestors signed treaties with the United States, they did so in exchange for certain guarantees. One of these was that our children and our children’s children would be educated this obligation is not a discretionary choice, it is the payment on a debt owed,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, who has been one of the few Democrats to break with her party and vote for the GOP-backed stopgap funding resolution to reopen the government, told CNN last week that she believes this shutdown is potentially more harmful to Native communities than past shutdowns have been.\n \n\n   \n  “Yeah, I think, what I hear from the tribes are because of the RIFs, because of the lack of a federal workforce, they’re already getting hit, and now, if some of them are being impacted by the shutdown because they don’t have access to SNAP funding, like some of my tribes, yeah, it’s a double whammy,” said Cortez Masto. “There is a concern that we’ve got to live up to just our existing obligations to the tribes, that the federal government doesn’t and we’ve got to do more.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have a trust and treaty obligation to the tribes, whether there’s a government shutdown or not, and the federal government has a role to play, and we have to continue to support that obligation,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Sarah Harris, the vice chairwoman of the Mohegan Tribe and the secretary of the United South and Eastern Tribes, said that the uncertainty surrounding the shutdown has been particularly harmful.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that one of the things that has been incredibly challenging for tribes during shutdown and with the RIFs is just the complete lack of transparency,” said Harris.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no end in sight, and there’s no information. I mean, tribal governments are resilient and resourceful, and we are problem solvers, but it’s difficult to know what you’re even solving for – if its short term or if it’s long term – and so I think everyone right now is just, you know, dealing with what’s in front of them and trying to find stopgap measures to provide for our tribal citizens, until, you know, there’s more clarity,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Two federal judges ruled on Friday that the administration must use emergency funds to continue paying for some SNAP benefits, however that doesn’t cancel out the uncertainty for Native communities.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, the top Democrat on the panel, emphasized the government’s obligations to Native American communities in his opening remarks at the hearing, saying, “when the federal government shuts down, our trust and treaty and legal obligations do not vanish, but they are put at risk. Promises to provide health care, housing, education and public safety, among so many other critical services, are all on the chopping block.”\n \n\n   \n  Schatz added, “Native programs are not DEI spending, they are not charity, they are the law; attempting to cancel funds for Native programs, RIFing more than 4200 federal employees and eliminating tribal consultation policies, that’s not the United States government meeting its trust and legal obligations.”\n \n\n   \n  Murkowski, who represents a state with a large Native America population, emphasized that federal layoffs and potential benefit lapses are disproportionately affecting Native communities, even when they aren’t carried out in agencies specifically tasked with working with tribal nations.\n \n\n   \n  “I think they kind of like, block them off – It’s the Bureau of Indian Education, it’s the Bureau of Indian Affairs, it’s the Indian Health Service. And so, it’s like, okay, but what they’re failing to recognize, perhaps, is how many other programs are serving tribal citizens across this country. And so whether it’s SNAP or whether it’s LIHEAP or whether it’s Head Start, none of those programs have the word Indian in them, but the impact to American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians may be, may be disproportionate,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Murkowski also noted that her Native constituents are particularly concerned about having to choose between food and fuel as winter sets in. The damage from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, which hit Alaska around two weeks into the shutdown, has also complicated matters.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s something that for many, is really frightening,” she said, adding “There’s a lot of anxiety when it comes to food security right now. And again, in Alaska, this is the time of year where, okay, nothing is growing. You’ve either, you’ve either gotten your moose or your caribou or your fish, or you haven’t. And for those who were impacted by this, this devastating typhoon two weeks ago, almost all those in those villages have lost their food supply for the winter, the power out, and so food security is a is a big, big deal right now, as we enter wintertime.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/sport/new-york-city-marathon-obiri-kipruto","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00.000-05:00","title":"Obiri sets women’s NYC Marathon course record, Kipruto wins men’s race in photo finish","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hellen Obiri of Kenya set a new women’s course record at the 2025 New York City Marathon, finishing in 2:19:51, while compatriot Benson Kipruto narrowly defeated Alexander Mutiso in a photo finish to win the men’s race, both finishing in 2:08:09.

AP\n \n   \n  Hellen Obiri of Kenya set a women’s course record to win the New York City Marathon on Sunday while compatriot Benson Kipruto won the men’s race by edging Alexander Mutiso in a photo finish.\n \n\n   \n  Obiri, who also won the race in 2023, finished in 2 hours, 19 minutes and 51 seconds. Obiri was running with 2022 winner Sharon Lokedi until she pulled away from her countrymate in the final mile, surging ahead and winning easily, besting the previous course record of 2:22.31 set by Margaret Okayo in 2003.\n \n\n   \n  Defending champion Sheila Chepkirui finished third. All three beat the previous course best.\n \n\n   \n  Kipruto and Mutiso separated themselves from the chase pack in the men’s race heading into Mile 24. Kipruto seemed to have put the race away, pulling away from Mutiso in the last 200 meters. But Mutiso, who also is from Kenyan, wasn’t done, surging in the last 50 meters before just falling short. Kipruto finished in 2:08.09. Mutiso was a hair behind, finishing with the same time.\n \n\n   \n  Kenyan Albert Korir, who won in 2021, was third, giving Kenya a sweep of the top three spots in both the men’s and women’s races. Joel Reichow was the top American, coming in sixth.\n \n\n   \n  Eliud Kipchoge, who turns 41 next week, wrapped up a historic run as one of the most accomplished marathoners in the sport. He ran the New York City Marathon for the first time and finished 17th.\n \n\n   \n  On the women’s side, the trio of former champions separated themselves heading into the Bronx at Mile 20. American Fiona O’Keeffe and Dutch runner Sifan Hassan had made it a pack of five once the group entered Manhattan a few miles earlier but couldn’t hang on for the final six miles.\n \n\n   \n  This was the first time that the previous three women’s winners had been in the same race since 2018. The trio didn’t disappoint, putting forth stellar efforts. It was the second straight year that Kenyans took the top three spots.\n \n\n   \n  O’Keeffe finished fourth, with fellow American Annie Frisbie finishing fifth. Hassan, who won the Sydney Marathon two months ago, was next. Four of the top nine finishers were Americans.\n \n\n   \n  The 26.2-mile course took runners through all five boroughs of New York, starting in Staten Island and ending in Manhattan’s Central Park. This is the 49th year the race has been in all five boroughs. Before that, the route was completely in Central Park. The first race had only 55 finishers while a record 55,642 people finished last year, the largest in the history of the sport until the London Marathon broke it earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The weather was great to run in, with temperatures in the 50s Fahrenheit when the race started.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"13:24:00Z","title":"Timeline of U.S. Strikes on Boats That Killed 64","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military, under the Trump administration, conducted 15 strikes on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific between September 2 and November 1, 2025, killing 64 people and destroying 16 vessels.

killed 64 \n       \n  By Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, Matt Stiles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:24 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has killed 64 people in 15 strikes that have destroyed 16 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There have been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, 27th.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor. The Mexican Navy said Friday that the search is in a “suspended active” status and the person is considered missing.\n \n\n   \n     October 29 \n \n\n   \n  The United States Armed Forces carried out an attack on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean that left four dead, Hegseth reported.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary said in a  post on X . He added that US forces suffered no casualties.\n \n\n   \n    November 1\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out  a strike on a nother vessel in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/democrats-shutdown-politics","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Democrats Are Winning the Shutdown Politics.

It had no chance of success,” then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  said .\n \n\n   \n  Then-House Speaker John Boehner initially said the GOP had “fought the good fight.” But he would later say the plan “ never had a chance ” and even called the Texas senator “ Lucifer in the flesh .”\n \n\n   \n  This is how shutdowns generally go. The side seeking a concession fights what they view as “the good fight,” and then they give up when it becomes clear that it’s also a losing fight. Because, as McConnell has often said, shutdowns don’t work.\n \n\n   \n  And maybe that’s how Democrats thought this one would go down. House Speaker Mike Johnson basically predicted as much Saturday, wagering Democrats might  back down after Tuesday’s elections .\n \n\n   \n  But a full month into the shutdown, it’s hard to see how Democrats can give up now. The politics of this have gone surprisingly well for them. And Republicans seem to be the ones struggling for a path forward.\n \n\n   \n  Much can change as some of the biggest impacts of the shutdown  start to hit this weekend  and in the coming weeks. But we’re in a very different kind of shutdown this time — one where it’s much tougher to see the politics forming an obvious off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The polling on blame has been remarkably constant since before the shutdown began. People continue to blame President Donald Trump and the Republicans more than Democrats by double-digit margins in most surveys. That margin was  45%-33%  in a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A  Yahoo News-YouGov poll , meanwhile, showed 46% said they blamed “conservative Republicans” a lot for the shutdown — more than the 38% who blamed “progressive Democrats” that much.\n \n\n   \n  Surveys also continue to show that Democrats’ policy demand, an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies, remains popular with more than 7 in 10 Americans.\n \n\n   \n  That Yahoo survey also suggested a problem for Republicans that we haven’t seen tested in previous polling.\n \n\n   \n  It showed Americans said by a nearly 3-to-1 margin — 63%-21% — that they disapproved of the firings of thousands of federal workers during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  This was, of course, Trump’s big threat to Democrats. He made a big show of casting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as the grim reaper ready to target Democratic employees and programs for cuts — even as some Republicans  cautioned the White House  that such cuts could squander the GOP’s political advantages. Then the administration  followed through .\n \n\n   \n  But it  doesn’t seem to have dissuaded Democrats from pressing forward. And there’s now reason to believe those Republicans had a point about these cuts backfiring on the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, much of the GOP’s handling of this seems rather haphazard. And Friday was a case in point.\n \n\n   \n  The day started with Republicans dealing with a curveball from Trump, who decided late Thursday to suddenly urge them to nuke the filibuster to end the shutdown. This completely impractical idea also  legitimized a key Democratic talking point  — that Republicans could end the shutdown any time they want.\n \n\n   \n  Then Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made a few seemingly unhelpful comments about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, also known as food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  She at one point said that if people really needed them that badly, then “ we have failed you .” House Speaker Mike Johnson soon stepped in to clarify that the “we” somehow meant, “we, the Democrats.” (Neither Rollins nor Johnson is, in fact, a Democrat.)\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Rollins was noncommittal when asked whether the administration would abide by a judge’s order for it to release emergency SNAP funds, saying, “We’re looking at all the options.”\n \n\n   \n  It was a stunning response — not just because ignoring court orders could trigger a constitutional crisis, but also because it would mean the administration would be taking such a drastic step to prevent poor people from getting food.\n \n\n   \n  A  pair of federal judges  soon ordered the administration to release the emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits. But ahead of the rulings, Republicans did a great job making themselves out to be opposed to this — and even ready to fight against it. (Trump on Friday night ultimately indicated he  would do what he could to fund SNAP .)\n \n\n   \n  Another major factor here is what the shutdown could do for Democrats. It’s early, but there is evidence this has led to something of a badly needed rallying effect on the left.\n \n\n   \n  The reason the Democratic Party has seen some of its worst poll numbers in history this year is largely because Democrats themselves have lost faith in their party. But a  Quinnipiac University poll  last week showed 58% of Democratic voters suddenly approved of their party’s congressional contingent.\n \n\n   \n  That’s still not great. But it is up nearly 20 points from where it was between February and July, when that number hovered around 40%.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats would seem to have relatively little reason to back down — and plenty of reason to stick with their demands that Republicans come to the table on extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. Imagine a situation in which they have these seeming political advantages and they throw in the towel anyways. It’s not difficult to see that reigniting a backlash on the left.\n \n\n   \n  And in case that danger wasn’t clear, witness a newly released Pew Research Center poll. It asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who expressed frustration with the party what the main reason for that was. Far and away, the most-cited reason was not fighting hard enough against the Trump administration,  which 41% cited .\n \n\n   \n  If you’re a Democrat, it’s hard to look at all of that and not want to at least let things play out. You might think the  premium increases  that people are seeing on their Obamacare plans after open enrollment began Saturday could shift the politics even more in your favor. And maybe you’ve got a little more confidence in how the SNAP issue is going to play.\n \n\n   \n  You might even start to think that, at the end of this long journey, there could be something more valuable than a moral victory.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/uk/stabbing-huntingdon-train-england-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"04:47:00Z","title":"Nine people suffer life-threatening injuries in UK after train stabbing attack","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A stabbing attack on a train traveling from Doncaster to London’s King’s Cross in central England on November 1, 2025, resulted in nine people suffering life-threatening injuries.

2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nine people suffered life-threatening injuries on Saturday night after a stabbing attack on a train in central England that Prime Minister Keir Starmer described as “deeply concerning.”\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested after the attack, which British Transport Police (BTP) declared “a major incident,” adding that counterterrorism officers were supporting the investigation. BTP also declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before later rescinding this.\n \n\n   \n  Police said 10 people were taken to hospital, nine of whom suffered life-threatening injuries. No fatalities have been reported from the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Officers were called at at 7.42 p.m. to a report of the attack on the service from the northern city of Doncaster to London’s King’s Cross. Armed officers were deployed to Huntingdon station, where the train made an unplanned stop and the two people were arrested, police said.\n \n\n   \n  More than 12 hours after the incident, police had yet to reveal details about the suspected attackers.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Defence Minister John Healey told Sky News on Sunday that the incident appeared to be an “isolated attack.”\n \n\n   \n    Passenger saw suspect tasered\n \n\n   \n  Wren Chambers, who was on the train when the attack happened, told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down.\n \n\n   \n  “A minute or so later a man… was running down with a very clear wound, bleeding quite badly on his arm. And I thought it was like some sort of Halloween prank at first. But then he’s shouting that someone’s got a knife, he was stabbed,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  After seeing more people running down the train, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get far down the train as they can.”\n \n\n   \n  Another witness who was traveling on the train said he saw an “extremely bloodied” victim. The man, who gave his name as Gavin, told Sky News he believed he saw a suspect tasered before he was arrested.\n \n\n   \n  He said police shouted “Get down, get down” as they got closer to him.\n \n\n   \n  “He then was waving a knife, quite a large knife, and then they detained him,” the eyewitness said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Another male passenger, Olly Foster, told the Daily Mail he’d been listening to an audiobook when the attack happened. “A young girl was distraught as the attacker tried to stab her, but a hero of an older man got in the way taking a gash on his forehead and I think another on his neck,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Video shared on social media of the immediate aftermath of the incident showed a bloodied person rushing out of Huntingdon station and dozens of police and emergency vehicles with flashing blue lights gathered outside. In one video armed officers were seen sprinting down a platform at the station toward the front end of a stationary train.\n \n\n   \n  British Transport Police Chief Superintendent Chris Casey called it “a shocking incident” and said his thoughts were with those injured and their families.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re conducting urgent enquiries to establish what has happened, and it could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything further,” he said. “At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident.”\n \n\n   \n    Large-scale response\n \n\n   \n  Emergency first responders said they had mobilized a large-scale response to the stabbing attack, including sending several air ambulances.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement on X, the East of England Ambulance Service said it had sent “numerous ambulances, tactical commanders, our Hazardous Area Response Team, and critical care teams,” from several regional jurisdictions.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer said on social media: “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” he said on X.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”   \n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said she is receiving regular updates on the investigation and urged people to avoid “speculation at this early stage” as to what was behind the stabbings.\n \n\n   \n  The rail company that operates trains on the East Coast Main Line, London North Eastern Railway (LNER), said that it was “experiencing major disruption across the LNER route.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.\n \n\n   \n  “Our advice is ‘Do Not Travel’. Please defer your travel where you can,” LNER said.\n \n\n   \n  It remains unclear at this stage what crimes the attackers will be charged with. Homicide rates in the UK are low compared to other Western nations. Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics. In comparison knife crime has risen overall since 2011, although a 1% decrease was recorded over the past year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/rama-duwaji-mamdani-wife-nyc-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Rama Duwaji, Zohran Mamdani’s wife, stays in the background by design","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rama Duwaji, the wife of New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, intentionally avoids traditional first lady roles and media spotlight, choosing instead to remain a private, behind-the-scenes presence.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rama Duwaji isn’t playing the traditional role of a first lady in waiting.\n \n\n   \n  She hasn’t stumped for  Zohran Mamdani , the New York City Democratic mayoral nominee and front-runner she married earlier this year. She hasn’t done a joint television appearance or agreed to a splashy magazine profile.\n \n\n   \n  And hardly anything on her Instagram page, where she promotes her artwork depicting Middle Eastern women and the plight of Palestinians, suggests that she even knows Mamdani, aside from one post on the day of the June Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  “Couldn’t possibly be prouder,”  she wrote  in the caption of a carousel of photos showing the couple together, a photo of herself voting early and a photo of Mamdani as a boy.\n \n\n   \n  If Mamdani wins Tuesday’s election, becoming the city’s first Muslim mayor and its youngest in a century, Duwaji too would be positioned to make and shape history. She would be the first member of Gen Z to serve as New York City’s first lady, a 28-year-old artist moving into Gracie Mansion under the relentless spotlight of America’s largest city.\n \n\n   \n  While she’s skipped traditional campaign set pieces, Duwaji has been present during key moments and has advised behind the scenes on social media and campaign iconography. She tagged along as Mamdani cast his primary vote early in the day, when many observers still thought he was  unlikely to beat former Gov. Andrew Cuomo , and joined Mamdani onstage when  he delivered his victory speech  that night.\n \n\n   \n  She accompanied Mamdani to his most recent appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.” And she was in the crowd, sitting alongside more than 10,000 people at a packed Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, to watch Mamdani make  his closing argument at a rally  headlined by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n \n\n   \n  It isn’t clear what, if any, official role Duwaji would have if Mamdani is elected mayor. She has declined interviews during the general election campaign, including a request from CNN for this story.\n \n\n   \n  But the last several months offer some clues.\n \n\n   \n    An awareness of what she was getting into\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji, who is of Syrian descent, was born in Houston and lived in Texas until her family moved to Dubai when she was 9. She briefly attended the Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar before transferring to the school’s Richmond campus to complete her degree. She later earned a master’s degree in illustration as visual essay from the School of Visual Arts in New York.\n \n\n   \n  Her illustrations have appeared in The Cut, the BBC, Vogue and The New Yorker.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji and Mamdani met on the dating app Hinge in 2021. Mamdani had recently been elected to the New York State Assembly, something Duwaji knew little about.\n \n\n   \n  Their first date would sound familiar to many of the young supporters of Mamdani’s campaign: They shared a meal at Qahwah House, a Yemeni coffee shop in Brooklyn, followed by a stroll in nearby McCarren Park. On their second date, Mamdani took Duwaji on a tour of his legislative district in Astoria, Queens.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Duwaji were engaged a few years later, in October 2024. Days after announcing their engagement on Instagram, Mamdani launched his campaign for mayor. They celebrated their engagement in Dubai that December, followed by a courthouse wedding this February at the city clerk’s office in Lower Manhattan. They posed for photos on the green couches of the marriage bureau’s waiting room, in front of a backdrop showing City Hall.\n \n\n   \n  Several months before the ceremony, Mamdani and Duwaji discussed how his plans to run for mayor could potentially change their lives, limit their privacy and likely thrust Duwaji into the public eye, according to a person familiar with the couple granted anonymity to share private details.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Mamdani launched his mayoral bid and questions began to swirl about the couple — “Socialist NYC mayoral contender Zohran Mamdani secretly tied the knot in exotic Dubai ceremony, photos show,” read a  New York Post headline  — he released their civil ceremony images on Instagram.\n \n\n   \n  “Rama isn’t just my wife, she’s an incredible artist who deserves to be known on her own terms,” Mamdani wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji, the person familiar with the couple said, knew what she was getting into. In the year that Mamdani has campaigned for mayor, she has been a major source of support, even if he falls asleep on the couch as they try to get through “Temptation Island” and the “Mission Impossible” series in 15- to 30-minute increments.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji helped finalize the campaign’s brand identity and worked on the final version of the campaign’s iconography and font, which showcases a distinct blend of colors easily identifiable to New Yorkers: Metrocard orange-yellow, New York Mets blue for shadow drops and backgrounds, and splashes of firehouse red. The font calls back to a time of bold-yellow bodega signs calling out to customers.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, whose mayoral bid has been powered by his use of social media, also credits Duwaji with improving the campaign’s digital sensibilities.\n \n\n   \n  He has sometimes been peppered with questions about his young marriage and the couple’s future. At a recent press conference where Mamdani was highlighting his proposal to provide newborn New Yorkers and their families with “baby baskets,” he was asked whether he planned on having any children soon.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like I’m talking to my mother,” the 34-year-old responded with a laugh, adding that for now, he is focused on the mayoral race.\n \n\n   \n    A focus on the Palestinian cause\n \n\n   \n  Traditionally, first spouses thrust into high-profile support roles host events, back causes that complement their partner’s agenda, and keep their more controversial opinions to themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji’s political views speak loudly through her art, which features black-and-white illustrations depicting Middle Eastern women, severe hunger in Gaza and the Palestinian flag. Those posts broadly align with her husband’s  criticisms of the Israeli government  and its conduct of the war following Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks, comments that have at times  roiled New York City’s Jewish population , the largest outside Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “What she is posting has been in line with many of the things that Mamdani has talked about,” said Lisa Burns, a professor of media studies at Quinnipiac University who has studied the role of first ladies. “I’m starting to see some of that work merging, where the advocacy work that she is doing will support the work he is doing — even if it’s separate — as opposed to detracting from it.”\n \n\n   \n  In an April  interview  with Yung, a quarterly magazine focused on art from Africa and the Middle East, Duwaji said she creates her work “for people who care about the things I care about.”\n \n\n   \n  “With so many people being pushed out and silenced by fear, all I can do is use my voice to speak out about what’s happening in the US and Palestine and Syria as much as I can,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    A role to be defined\n \n\n   \n  New York City is no stranger to mayoral spouses with their own public profiles.\n \n\n   \n  Mayor Bill de Blasio’s then-wife, Chirlane McCray, was a staple of his campaign and administration, providing input on staff picks and high-profile appointments. Part of de Blasio’s  appeal to voters  was how his multiracial family had helped shape his worldview.\n \n\n   \n  A 2013  New York Times profile  of McCray described her and de Blasio as being “as much a package deal as Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton.” Political meetings were set around her schedule, and McCray sat in on key job interviews. She was assigned oversight of a mental health initiative that brought her in front of the City Council during budget negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Diana Taylor, the longtime partner of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, was a former government official and finance executive who didn’t define herself by the role.\n \n\n   \n  “Her famous boyfriend may be the least interesting thing about her,” then-Vogue editor Anna Wintour, a friend of Taylor’s, told  The Washington Post  in 2020 when Bloomberg was running for president. “She’s intelligent, independent — and completely her own person.”\n \n\n   \n  For now, Duwaji’s presence can’t be seen by most New Yorkers, even if it is felt quietly by her husband’s campaign.\n \n\n   \n  At a recent “sip and pour” event at a senior citizen center in Brooklyn intended to get out the vote, Mamdani tried to follow along as an art instructor showed the group how to draw a fall landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Brush in hand and a paper plate with dots of paint as a palette, Mamdani tried to tamp down expectations.\n \n\n   \n  “I have to warn you all, I’m not very good at painting,” he said, adding the last time he had painted anything was on a date with his wife. Mamdani then began to draw. Asked later about the quality of his sketch, he said, “Don’t tell my wife.”\n \n\n   \n  A campaign aide had already done so, texting a photo of his attempt to draw a tree.\n \n\n   \n  She fired back: “That is a triangle.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/uk/andrew-sandringham-estate-explained-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"09:04:00-05:00","title":"What we know about Sandringham, Andrew’s new home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, the former royal, is being removed from his residence at Royal Lodge in Windsor and relocated to Sandringham estate in Norfolk due to public outrage over his alleged connections with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, particularly following Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.

9:04 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The rapid fall from grace of the now  former Prince Andrew , culminating in his humiliating exile by  King Charles III  to the Sandringham estate, has been no less than stunning.\n \n\n   \n  His titles and honors are in the process of being formally stripped – he will henceforth be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – and he’s been served notice to surrender his 75-year lease of  Royal Lodge , the huge mansion he has lived in for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  It is not yet known exactly when Andrew will leave Windsor, west of the British capital London, for the monarch’s retreat in rural Norfolk.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the sprawling estate that Andrew will soon call home.\n \n\n   \n    The late Queen’s favorite retreat\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has agreed to move out of the 30-room royal residence he has shared with his ex-wife  Sarah Ferguson  within the grounds of Windsor Great Park and into a new home in Sandringham. The estate was beloved by the late Queen Elizabeth II and is now said to be a favorite escape for Andrew’s elder brother King Charles and Queen Camilla.\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace is keen for Andrew to move to the country estate, roughly 100 miles north of London, as soon as is practical. But it will not happen immediately, a royal source told CNN on Friday. That’s because giving notice, surrendering the lease and other formalities related to the relocation - which is similar to buying a house - could make it a protracted process.\n \n\n   \n   Sandringham  was purchased in 1862 by Queen Victoria for her eldest son and heir Albert, later Edward VII, who had just turned 21. It has been the private home of five generations of British monarchs and is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas each year.\n \n\n   \n    Christmas family tradition\n \n\n   \n  Sandringham is perhaps the most famous stately home in Norfolk, on England’s east coast. The massive estate is spread across an estimated 20,000 acres, with 600 acres of royal parkland and some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  Since its purchase, each monarch has helped develop it over the years. The main house was completed in 1870, with a ballroom added 13 years later. Guest and staff accommodation came in the 1890s. It underwent a major overhaul in 1975 when more than 100 rooms in the service wing were demolished “to remove dry rot, save on heating costs and move the kitchens closer to the Dining Room,” according to the Sandringham website.\n \n\n   \n  The house was also the location for Queen Elizabeth II’s first televised Christmas broadcast in 1957.\n \n\n   \n  Within the grounds sits St. Mary Magdalene Church which is routinely used as a place of worship by the Windsors when in residence. It has become a tradition to see the family walk to it every Christmas morning, greeting well-wishers along the way.\n \n\n   \n  The estate also includes an organic farm, sawmill, residential and commercial properties, local parishes and communities.\n \n\n   \n  King George V described Sandringham as “the place I love better than anywhere else in the world” while his son and Queen Elizabeth II’s father George VI once wrote, “I have always been happy here and I love the place.”\n \n\n   \n  The property’s gardens were the first part of the estate to be opened to the public in 1908 by Edward VII. Elizabeth II later opened the main house to the public in 1977 to coincide with her silver jubilee year.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband Philip took responsibility for the estate’s management when Elizabeth acceeded to the throne in 1952. Conservation was at the heart of his approach to ensure that it was maintained for future generations.\n \n\n   \n    So where might Andrew live?\n \n\n   \n  No family members live at Sandringham House permanently these days, but King Charles frequently visits the grand property. Within its vast grounds there are several properties where the monarch could house his brother.\n \n\n   \n   York Cottage , previously known as Bachelor’s Cottage, was given to then-Duke and Duchess of York – the future George V and Queen Mary – as a wedding gift in 1893 by Edward VII. In recent years it has been used as accommodation for vacationers as well as estate staff and has also been used as the estate office for Sandringham, according to the Times of London. It was also reportedly considered for Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex before they stepped back as working royals.\n \n\n   \n   Gardens House  is another viable option. It was previously the home of the estate’s head gardener. The four-bed, three-bath property is currently being used as a holiday let. “This light and airy red brick Edwardian property accommodates up to eight guests, with each room thoughtfully furnished with a blend of rustic pieces, modern comforts, and botanical prints,” the Sandringham website reads.\n \n\n   \n   The Folly  is another available property on the estate. It too is being offered to travelers looking for the chance to “experience the serene splendour” of Sandringham. The original structure dates back to the 1800s and over the years has served as a hunting lodge and a space for ladies to enjoy afternoon tea. It can sleep six guests in its three bedrooms and features a wraparound balcony with a staircase that leads to a turret which “offers panoramic views across the estate,” according to its listing.\n \n\n   \n   Park House  is an additional property on the estate, but it would require some work. It was where Diana, the former Princess of Wales was born and spent much of her childhood. In the early 80s it was offered to charity Leonard Cheshire, which transformed it into a hotel for disabled people. There were plans for it to be renovated in 2019 which were put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n \n\n   \n   Wood Farm  is a farmhouse on the estate that has strong ties to Andrew’s parents. It is also where his father, Prince Philip, based himself after retiring from public duties in 2017 at the age of 95. However, it is not thought to be where Andrew will end up.\n \n\n   \n  Another option, though it seems incredibly unlikely, is  Anmer Hall,  which was gifted to Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales by the late Queen when they wed in 2013. The couple, along with their three children, do not live there permanently but are still thought to spend time during school breaks at the 10-bedroom Georgian property.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the move happening now?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is losing his royal titles and styles, as well as his Windsor home after weeks of snowballing scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Public fury was compounded after the publication of a  posthumous memoir from Virginia Giuffre  in October, in which she repeated her claims that she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions as a teenager while being trafficked by Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has always denied the claims made against him. But it is understood that the King took action after the recent developments sparked renewed outrage and threatened to taint the monarchy’s reputation further.\n \n\n   \n  His decision to essentially banish his disgraced brother to Sandringham came after consulting legal and constitutional experts, as well as his wider family and the government.\n \n\n   \n  Downing Street said Friday that it backed the King’s actions to remove Andrew’s titles and honors. “Our hearts go out to the family of Virginia Giuffre and all the victims who suffered from Jeffrey Epstein’s despicable crimes in all of this. We should never forget that,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew will also lose his last remaining military rank as vice admiral of the Royal Navy at the request of King Charles III, British defense minister John Healey told the BBC on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    And who will pay for relocation?\n \n\n   \n  Sandringham House and its extensive surrounding estate have been handed down through the generations and is privately owned by the sovereign.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, Andrew’s current home in Windsor is part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state.\n \n\n   \n  It is understood that the disgraced royal will move to an undisclosed property, with the relocation privately financed by Charles, who will also make financial provisions for his sibling.\n \n\n   \n  His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is also moving from Royal Lodge but she will make her own living arrangements and is not expected to join Andrew at Sandringham.\n \n\n   \n  The two Pembroke Welsh corgis,  Muick and Sandy, that once belonged to Queen Elizabeth II  will remain in the care of Andrew’s family, Buckingham Palace confirmed to Britain’s PA Media news agency on Friday. However, the palace did not specify if the dogs would stay with Ferguson, head to Norfolk with Andrew or be passed on to their daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/tech/saudi-arabia-ai-powerhouse","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Saudi Arabia is making a massive bet on becoming a global AI powerhouse","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Saudi Arabia is aggressively investing in artificial intelligence through Humain, a homegrown company backed by its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund.

powerhouse \n       \n  By Tala Alrajjal, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Saudi Arabia is turning its oil wealth toward its massive AI ambitions.\n \n\n   \n  Its chief investment vehicle is Humain, a homegrown company that is building out a full stack of data centers, cloud capabilities, large language models and applications. It’s owned by the Kingdom’s nearly $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund.\n \n\n   \n  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman  unveiled Humain in May  ahead of President Donald Trump’s  state visit to Riyadh . This week, at the annual Future Investment Initiative in the same location, the scale, ambition and deep pockets behind the project came into clearer focus.\n \n\n   \n  Humain CEO, Tareq Amin, is setting out to make Saudi Arabia the world’s third-largest AI market, after the United States and China. It’s a bold ambition for a newcomer to the industry, but Amin argues the Kingdom’s competitive edge lies in its abundant and cheap energy resources that can feed the seemingly insatiable demand for computing power.\n \n\n   \n  “We have an advantage in Saudi Arabia,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “Look at this country’s amazing energy grid that doesn’t require a company like Humain to build the substations and the power to deliver that to a data center. That means I have saved 18 months of time.”\n \n\n   \n  Humain plans to build up to six gigawatts in data center capability across the country by 2034, with a rolodex of key AI partners, including Nvidia, AMD, Amazon Web Services, Qualcomm and Cisco.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Humain announced a  $3 billion deal  with private equity giant Blackstone to build data centers in the Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  It also publicly launched  Humain One , an AI-powered operating system where users speak or type to a computer to tell it to perform tasks, rather than clicking on icons, as is conventional in systems like Windows or iOS.\n \n\n   \n  Humain has been using the AI system internally to run much of its HR, finance, legal, operational and IT departments. Amin says there is now only one employee in his payroll department, with AI agents handling the rest.\n \n\n   \n  The Kingdom is entering the closing stretch of its Vision 2030 economic transformation plan facing headwinds from declining oil prices and delays in its construction of giga-projects like Neom, placing new urgency on its AI push to support the growth of the Arab world’s largest economy.\n \n\n   \n  It also  faces competition  from the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which has its own AI vehicle, G42, and recently secured a landmark deal with the Trump administration to build “ Stargate UAE ,” a sprawling $500 billion data center project billed as the largest outside the United States, with the help of OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether there’s room for two regional heavyweights, Amin said he supports democratizing AI, while touting Humain’s robust operations.\n \n\n   \n  “It is good for humanity to have knowledge — especially around AI — not to be all centralized in one location. So it’s good what is happening in the UAE. It’s very good what’s happening in Saudi Arabia,” he said. “I will tell you what we decided to do, which is very different … Humane is not a holding company. We are an operating company.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/zohran-mamdani-jewish-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"11:30:00-05:00","title":"‘I hate my choices’: How Zohran Mamdani’s run for mayor has split Jews in New York","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 New York mayoral election has become a flashpoint for deep ideological and generational divisions within the Jewish American community, particularly over Zohran Mamdani’s pro-Palestinian and critical stance on Israel. While Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, won the Democratic primary and has gained support from progressive Jewish leaders and activists, his positions—such as refusing to condemn Hamas, calling Israel’s actions in Gaza a 'genocide,' and pledging to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu—have drawn fierce criticism from traditional and religious Jewish leaders, including Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove and over 1,100 rabbis who signed a letter opposing his candidacy. Polling shows that despite Mamdani’s appeal to progressive values and policies like rent control and affordability, a majority of Jewish likely voters still prefer Andrew Cuomo, reflecting a broader unease about the intersection of politics and Jewish identity. The election highlights a growing generational split: while older Jews are emotionally attached to Israel (56%), younger Jews (18–34) are less so (36%), leading to a fractured Jewish electorate.

   11:30 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As a Jew and a New Yorker, Norman Needleman said he finds the city’s mayoral election “painful.”\n \n\n   \n  Waiting in line Friday to vote on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, the 77-year-old Needleman thought Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist, would be good for the city’s social needs. But his positions on Israel were just too much for Needleman to accept.\n \n\n   \n  “If I try and bend that far, I’ll break,” he said, quoting the musical “Fiddler on the Roof.”\n \n\n   \n  His comments reflect what has been a fraught debate, among Jews in New York and elsewhere, ahead of the city’s mayoral election Tuesday. Jewish voters have long reliably  supported Democrats , and Mamdani won the Democratic primary, but concerns about rising antisemitism and Mamdani’s sharp criticisms of Israel have opened up a generational split and raised deeper questions what it means to be an American Jew in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  This election has shown clearly that “Jews and Jewish voters are not a monolith,” said Phylisa Wisdom, the director of the New York Jewish Agenda, an advocacy group promoting liberal Jewish New Yorkers.\n \n\n   \n  “Folks have been really trying to reckon with how much does it matter that they have a mayor that has their same feelings about Israel,” she said. “There are some who feel like it’s not the most important thing to me when I’m voting for mayor, how they feel about Israel, and there are some who think it’s existential, and they couldn’t vote for someone who disagrees with them on Israel or doesn’t support Israel as a Jewish state.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue stems from Mamdani’s history of pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel activism, from his college days when he started a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, to his support for the  Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement  against Israel, to his pledge to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  In more recent months, Mamdani has tempered some of his most controversial positions and tried to reassure Jewish voters worried about antisemitic attacks like the ones in  Washington, DC , and  Boulder, Colorado . Democratic Jewish politicians like City Comptroller  Brad Lander  and Rep.  Jerry Nadler  have endorsed him, though US Sen. Chuck Schumer remains a notable holdout.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone has been convinced.\n \n\n   \n  “Shabbat Shalom. To be clear, unequivocal, and on the record: I believe Zohran Mamdani poses a danger to the security of the New York Jewish community,”  Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove  of Park Avenue Synagogue told his congregation on October 18.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,100 rabbis and Jewish leaders across the US soon  signed an open letter  agreeing with Cosgrove’s message and calling on Americans to “stand up for candidates who reject antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s rise comes amid a growing split in the American Jewish electorate, particularly along age lines, about Israel in the wake of the war in Gaza the last two years. While 56% of Jewish Americans say they are emotionally attached to Israel, that number falls to 36% among those aged 18 to 34, according to polling from  The Washington Post .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a tense time in the Jewish family group chats,” Ezra Klein wrote in  The New York Times  this summer.\n \n\n   \n  While Mamdani is ahead among likely voters in most public polls, recent polls from  Fox News  and  Marist  both had 55% of Jewish likely voters in the city backing former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running an independent campaign after losing to Mamdani in the June Democratic primary. Mamdani had 32% with Jewish voters in each poll.\n \n\n   \n  For voters like Cosgrove, Mamdani’s position on Israel is a dealbreaker. Others, like those in the progressive activist group  Jewish Voices for Peace , see it as a positive. Still many other Jews see Mamdani’s views on Israel as less important than his other proposed policies: freezing increases on the city’s rent-stabilized apartments, focusing on affordability and standing up to President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Not to mention Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa have their own drawbacks.\n \n\n   \n  “I hate my choices,” said Cydney Schwartz, a 33-year-old liberal Democrat who has lived in Israel.\n \n\n   \n    What Mamdani has said about Israel and Jews\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel advocacy have been a key throughline of his political beliefs.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has declined to say he believes Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state, saying the country should provide equal rights to all residents. He previously refused to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada,” referencing an Arabic term used by Palestinians to describe their uprising against Israel. He has recently said he  would discourage the use  of the phrase.\n \n\n   \n  A day after the  October 7, 2023 , Hamas attacks on Israel, which sparked the devastating war in Gaza,  Mamdani issued  a statement that did not condemn Hamas or the attacks. He has repeatedly criticized Israel’s actions as a “ genocide ” and said he would arrest Netanyahu if he visits New York, citing a warrant from the  International Criminal Court , of which the US is not a member.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, a September 2023 video of him connecting New York Police Department oppression to the Israel Defense Forces spread widely online.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it’s been laced by the IDF,”  he said  then at a Democratic Socialists of America convention.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about that line last week, he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper, “It was a reference to training exercises that have taken place between the NYPD and the IDF.”\n \n\n   \n  “So do you still believe that the NYPD is basically working hand in glove with the IDF?” Cooper asked.\n \n\n   \n  “No. What I’ve made very clear is those are training exercises that are of concern to me,” Mamdani replied. “And what my focus is, is on working with the NYPD to actually deliver public safety for New Yorkers across the five boroughs.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, after his victory in the Democratic primary, he pledged to “understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree and to wrestle deeply with those disagreements.”\n \n\n   \n  During Rosh Hashanah, Mamdani attended services at Kolot Chayeinu, one of Brooklyn’s most progressive synagogues. For Yom Kippur, considered the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, Mamdani attended services at Lab Shul, a non-denominational Jewish congregation, accompanied by Jewish political allies in Nadler and Lander.\n \n\n   \n  He has met with Hasidic leaders, including two prominent rabbis from Williamsburg’s Satmar community, an ultra-Orthodox sect with its own set of demands for city government.\n \n\n   \n  He has promised he would keep in place police protection for the city’s annual parade honoring Israel. And he has said  he would not have an Israel-related  litmus test for working in his administration.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m going to have people in my administration who are Zionists,” he said, according to  The Free Press .\n \n\n   \n    How Jewish New Yorkers feel\n \n\n   \n  “Two Jews, three opinions,” goes the old joke, a play on the religion’s tradition of debate, and that was evident in conversations with liberal Jews voting for mayor Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re figuring it out,” Wisdom said. “There’s a lot of out-loud figuring it out.”\n \n\n   \n  Schwartz, the 33-year-old liberal who has lived in Israel, said she feels a powerful connection to the country. Still, she said, she didn’t agree with Israel’s politics or Netanyahu, similarly to how she disagrees with Trump’s politics in the US.\n \n\n   \n  She considered not voting, but ultimately picked a candidate, who she declined to share. “I want to focus on the city I live in,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  David, a 29-year-old wearing a yarmulke who declined to give his last name, said the vote felt like an “existential” decision. He said he didn’t particularly care about how the mayor feels about Israel, but Mamdani’s focus on Israeli-Palestinian politics made it hard to believe he’s not antisemitic, and he worried whether that could bleed into other policies.\n \n\n   \n  He said he planned to vote for Cuomo “reluctantly.” “He’s bad on everything,” David said of his preferred choice. “He’s a bad person.”\n \n\n   \n  Eric Weltman, a 58-year-old wearing a suit and tie, proudly said he voted for Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s smart, competent, principled and progressive,” he said, adding he had no qualms about Mamdani’s positions on Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s going to be mayor of New York, not ambassador to Israel,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As for Needleman, the 77-year-old who quoted “Fiddler,” he said he couldn’t support Mamdani and felt Cuomo was too dishonest. So he decided to vote for Sliwa even though he disagreed with the Republican’s politics, saying Sliwa seemed like a “decent guy.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/americas/mexico-sonora-fire-dozens-killed-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:57:00-04:00","title":"Fire at general store kills at least 23 in northern Mexico, state governor says","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fire at a Waldo’s general store in Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora state in northern Mexico, killed at least 23 people and injured 11, including minors.

in Nigeria \n       \n  By Alejandra Jaramillo, Nimi Princewill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:59 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump said Saturday he has ordered the Defense Department to prepare for possible military action in Nigeria as he continues to accuse the nation of not doing enough to stem violence against Christians — an accusation Nigeria has repeatedly denied.\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post criticizing what he called the “mass slaughter” of Christians in the country, Trump  wrote  the United States would “immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria” and warned the government there to “move fast.”\n \n\n   \n  In the lengthy message, Trump said the US “may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’ to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”\n \n\n   \n  Both Christians and Muslims have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists in the country of more than 230 million people. The violence in the country is driven by varying factors: some incidents are religiously motivated and affect both groups, while others arise from disputes between farmers and herders over limited resources, as well as communal and ethnic tensions.\n \n\n   \n  Although Christians are among those targeted, local reports indicate that most victims are Muslims living in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north.\n \n\n   \n  “I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action,” Trump wrote. “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!”\n \n\n   \n  “Yes sir,” US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth posted on social media with a screenshot of Trump’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “The killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria — and anywhere — must end immediately. The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s announcement comes after he accused Nigeria of religious freedom violations on Friday, claiming that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and designating the nation as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the  International Religious Freedom Act . The label is a suggestion that his administration has found that Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post after the designation, but before Trump’s mention of the military, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu  wrote : “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that Nigeria is “working with the United States government and the international community to deepen understanding and cooperation on protection of communities of all faiths.”\n \n\n   \n  Tinubu’s press secretary, responding to a social media post from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemning the “slaughter of thousands of Christians,” called the characterization “a gross exaggeration of the Nigerian situation,” adding that “Christians, Muslims, churches and mosques are attacked randomly.”\n \n\n   \n  “What our country requires from America is military support to fight these violent extremists in some states of our country, not designation as a nation of particular concern,” said Bayo Onanuga.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespersons for the White House and Tinubu’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/us-strikes-drug-boat-caribbean-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"02:39:00Z","title":"US Military Strikes Another Alleged Drug-Trafficking Boat in the Caribbean, Killing 3","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military conducted a lethal strike in the Caribbean Sea on November 2, 2025, killing three individuals on an alleged drug-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO).

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:39 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military carried out another  deadly strike on alleged drug-traffickers  at sea on Saturday, continuing a monthslong campaign by the Trump administration that has been widely criticized as likely illegal.\n \n\n   \n  The latest strike targeted a boat in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said three men, whom he identified as “narco-terrorists,” were killed in the operation, which he said was carried out in international waters. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n  The boat was “carrying narcotics” and “transiting along a known narco-trafficking route,” Hegseth said, citing US intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s attack marks the 15th known US military strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel since the Trump administration began the operations in early September. The strikes, which have been carried out in the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, have killed a total of 64 people.\n \n\n   \n  “These narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home—and they will not succeed. The Department will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda,” Hegseth said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s strike is the first targeting a boat in the Caribbean since October 24. After concentrating on the region initially, the Pentagon in recent weeks deliberately refocused its efforts against suspected drug traffickers to the eastern Pacific,  CNN reported  Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The shift was made because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, according to people familiar with the matter. Six known strikes have been carried out in the Pacific over the last two weeks, including three conducted in a single day last week.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in Congress and international leaders have questioned the legality of the Trump administration’s accelerating strikes.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the strikes  violate international law  and called for them to stop.\n \n\n   \n  “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats,” human rights commissioner Volker Türk said, according to a statement released by his office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers,  CNN previously reported . The opinion argues that the president is allowed to authorize deadly force against a broad range of cartels because they pose an imminent threat to Americans.\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers have accused the administration of lacking transparency about the strikes. A  closed-door briefing Thursday  lacked critical details and Pentagon lawyers were pulled from the session at the last minute, Democrats asserted last week.\n \n\n   \n  A day earlier, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner blasted the Trump administration for holding a briefing that day on the strikes but  not telling Democrats about it , calling the move “a partisan stunt.”\n \n\n   \n  While traveling in Asia on Friday, Hegseth insisted he had engaged Congress on a bipartisan basis regarding the strikes. However, that same day, Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, a Republican, and Ranking Member Jack Reed, a Democrat, released two letters they said they sent Hegseth over the past month seeking details about the operations but that have gone unanswered.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, Kaanita Iyer, and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/middleeast/motaz-azaizas-gaza-war-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00Z","title":"Motaz Azaiza’s photos from Gaza showed the heartbreak of war.

He recently launched a foundation to continue fundraising for Palestinians in Gaza, saying it will help to provide food and pastries, tanker trucks of clean water, blankets and shelter. “A candle in the darkness” is how he describes the Motaz Foundation to his Instagram followers, encouraging those in need to personally reach out for help.\n \n\n   \n  When asked at a recent event at the Muslim Wellness Center in Roswell, Georgia, why he named it after himself, he said that he simply couldn’t think of anything else to call it. But he’s proud of the work and it’s giving him purpose as he works through the traumatic upheaval of his life.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe this makes me forget the mental suffering that I’m in,” he pondered, leaning on the back of a pickup truck behind a Yemeni coffee shop which had just hosted a fundraising event for the foundation. “The moment I wire funds to people and get aid, support, and food, I feel high!” As he navigates a maelstrom of emotions, both his torment and his exhilaration are evident. “I’ve never been a useless person,” he said, “I’m always trying to be useful at every step.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 240 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led terror attack, in which more than 1,200 were killed and about 250 taken hostage, prompting Israel’s fierce military response. Israel denies targeting reporters, but Gaza has become the deadliest conflict zone ever for them, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he was receiving death threats via anonymous phone calls shortly before he left the strip and he knows that his story could easily have ended there. Does coming so close to death make him feel more alive? It’s complicated. “Yeah,” he responds, “because you don’t have anything to lose.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he has lost countless friends in Gaza. But he also feels as though he is dead inside. “My soul is turned off,” he said. Sometimes he felt lucky to survive – and luckier to escape – wrestling even now with survivors’ guilt, as do others who managed to flee the war  or  have witnessed it unfold from afar. “This is the feeling that people want me to feel,” he explains. “Or Israel wants me to feel, because if they defeat you inside then they don’t need to do anything else. I have it, but I’m trying not to allow it to control (me).”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he always wanted to be a photographer, but if violence hadn’t beaten a path to his door, then he would never have sought it out. He preferred taking artistic shots of bustling marketplaces or kids playing on the beach and resented that the outside world only seemed to be interested in paying for his work when he and Gaza’s other photojournalists competed for images depicting the most visceral scenes of the aftermath of an airstrike. His documentation of Israel’s response to the October 7 attack delivered him a massive social media following and professional success – his photo from October 31, 2023 of a woman trapped in a pancaked apartment building in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza was recognized as one of Time magazine’s  top 10 photographs of the year . But unlike his industry peers in other countries, he couldn’t celebrate the achievement because only his community’s extreme suffering had given him the opportunity to succeed.\n \n\n   \n    Dreams of war\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he feels that, somehow, fate chose him to be a bridge between the carnage in Gaza and the world outside, and he confides now that he foresaw his future many times before the war. Azaiza  would often dream of running through the streets in a press vest, a building next to him would blow up and he would bang his head on the ground before waking up, he said. The dream made no sense to him. “And then I found myself in the vest,” he said, “in the helmet, in the car (passing) the building that I saw in my dream. It was on fire. A lot of things that I imagined happened.”\n \n\n   \n  A young lady stood up to address him during one of the fundraising events in Georgia. “Thank you for opening our eyes,” she said, her voice cracking with emotion as she wiped tears from her cheeks. “Thank you for being alive, for being here. I’m so grateful for you.” Another man stood and hailed him a hero. “I’m not a hero,” Azaiza deflected, “I’m not Superman. I still have to wait in line for the toilet.”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza never wanted to be famous and, although he has more than 15 million followers on Instagram, he says that he’s the same man he was on October 6, 2023, just with more pressure on his shoulders. He’s learned the hard way that it’s impossible to stay out of politics when it comes to Gaza, where so many competing factions have their own agendas to promote; some of the people who used to applaud him now envy him and troll him with abuse on social media instead, he said. The hateful words are in some ways worse than the bullets, he said, because at least one knows how a bullet will hurt.\n \n\n   \n  “But this,” he paused for emphasis, “eats you from the inside, makes your heart tight, makes your stomach not able to eat, makes you overthink. And it hurts others around you, hurts your mom. The keyboard warriors, this is how Israel (can) win. They don’t need to divide us, we’re already divided.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s grateful for the ceasefire, and an end to the killing, but he doesn’t think it’s fair to the Palestinians. “I just wanted the genocide to stop,” he explained. “We’ve been calling for it to stop since October 9. Give them (Israel) the hostages. But nobody listened to us until we lost it all.\n \n\n   \n  “Now it sounds like peace that is giving Israel more peace and more power, they got what they wanted after the massacre, the whole strip. Maybe it’s going to last, because, like, there’s nothing left.”\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, echoing the findings of other genocide experts and human rights groups, all of which Israel has rejected.\n \n\n   \n  For now, Azaiza is focused on his humanitarian work but living in a kind of limbo. He dreams of returning to Gaza to build a home by the sea but wonders what kind of life he would be returning to. He says he’d like to be Gaza’s Minister of Youth one day but knows that many politicians become corrupt; he’d love to start a family too.\n \n\n   \n  Most of all, he dreams of working with his camera in a simpler life. “You know Tarzan?” he asked rhetorically. “I want to be Tarzan with a camera. I wish to go to Tanzania with my camera, capture lions and animals. I don’t want to capture any human anymore, humans bring problems, bring pain, and bring troubles. No humans anymore, only animals, that’s it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/pennsylvania-catholic-school-halloween-float-holocaust-imagery","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00Z","title":"Pennsylvania Diocese Condemns Holocaust Imagery Displayed on Catholic School’s Halloween Parade Float","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Catholic school in Hanover, Pennsylvania, displayed a replica of the Auschwitz concentration camp gate with the phrase 'Arbeit Macht Frei' during a Halloween parade float, prompting the Diocese of Harrisburg to issue a strong condemnation.

we have available.”\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social Friday evening. “If we are given

Program, or SNAP, costs between $8 billion and $9 billion a month, so the judges’ orders will not cover all of the needed payments for November.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt that the … contingency funds are appropriated funds that are without a doubt necessary to carry out the program’s operation.” US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island said. “The shutdown of the government through funding doesn’t do away with SNAP, it just does away with the funding of it.”\n \n\n   \n  During proceedings Friday, McConnell said he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure at least some benefits could be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur, if it hasn’t already occurred, in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In a written ruling released Saturday, McConnell wrote that the administration must make a partial payment to SNAP beneficiaries using the contingency funds by Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But he wrote the USDA should, within its discretion, find additional funds to provide full benefits to recipients. If the agency chooses this option, it must make the full payment by the end of Monday, as making the full payment is simpler than calculating partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  In his ruling, McConnell also responded directly to Trump’s comments Friday, writing, “the Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”\n \n\n   \n  McConnell’s ruling during a hastily scheduled hearing came minutes after US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston made a similar order. Both judges, appointees of President Barack Obama, also said that USDA is allowed to tap into another bucket of money of nearly $17 billion to pay November SNAP benefits in full, but that decision is currently up to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program. And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds … to avoid any reductions,”  Talwani said in a 15-page order. \n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration opposes tapping into those other funds, arguing in court it will hurt the child nutrition programs that the revenue supports.\n \n\n   \n  Even with Trump’s directive and the judge’s rulings, millions of recipients will still face delays in getting their benefits, which were scheduled to start being distributed on November 1. It will take time for the Department of Agriculture and states to get the money flowing again.\n \n\n   \n  In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  The Boston lawsuit was filed earlier this week by a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the case in Rhode Island was brought Thursday by a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could seek appeals. Asked earlier Friday by CNN what the department would do if courts required USDA to tap into the contingency fund, Secretary Brooke Rollins said, “We’re looking at all the options.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.\n \n\n   \n  Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information ahead of the new month in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\n \n\n   \n  Talwani acknowledged the likely delay in benefits during a hearing Thursday, and also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/obama-campaign-nj-virginia-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:21:00-04:00","title":"Obama Campaigns for Sherrill, Spanberger on Saturday in Home Stretch of Gubernatorial Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Barack Obama, the former U.S. President, campaigned in Virginia and New Jersey on the final weekend of the 2025 gubernatorial elections, urging voters to reject President Donald Trump’s leadership and to defend democratic norms.

By Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:21 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former President Barack Obama urged voters to break with President Donald Trump and “set a glorious example for the nation” on Saturday as he campaigned with the Democratic nominees for governor in Virginia and New Jersey ahead of Tuesday’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  In his first of two events Saturday, a rally with former Rep. Abigail Spanberger — the Democrat facing Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s governor race — Obama told the crowd in Norfolk that after the first nine months of Trump’s second term, “the stakes are now clear.”\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don’t need to wonder about whether vulnerable people are going to be hurt, or ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. We’ve witnessed it. Elections do matter,” he said. “We all have more power than we think. We just have to use it.”\n \n\n   \n  With the Democratic Party out of power in Washington and without a clear national leader, Obama is reprising his role as the party’s biggest and most unifying draw, delivering a closing message in the final days of elections that will serve as a temperature check on Trump’s first year and set the stage for next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey later Saturday, Obama told voters the state should “point America in a better direction” by electing Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat who is taking on GOP former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli in the governor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  He mocked Ciattarelli for saying in a debate that Trump deserves an “A” grade for his performance in office.\n \n\n   \n  “I know there’s been grade inflation, but really? An A? This is the best we could do? I mean, these are the same folks who put secret war plans in a group chat,” referring to the  Signal scandal . “You don’t think there’s anything they could be doing better?”\n \n\n   \n  Before heading out to the rallies on Saturday, Obama called Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City. He has not endorsed Mamdani — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the former president was sharply critical of Trump — though he only once used his name.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us are being tested right now,” Obama said. “Trump and the Republicans — they want you to think it’s part of their story, that things only happen from the top down; that a few people in power make decisions and the rest of us have to live with the consequences. But real change has always come from the bottom up; from ordinary folks who look around and say, we can do better, and then join together to make change happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Obama said he knew what Trump planned to do, but added that he “will admit, it’s worse than even I expected.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he worries about “how quickly basic democratic rules and norms have been weakened.” Obama also said he is concerned about “the growing concentration of economic power in this country,” and that business leaders, law firms and universities “have been willing to bend the knee to this president’s autocratic impulses” to avoid confrontation.\n \n\n   \n  He also criticized Trump’s replacement of career prosecutors with loyalists at the Justice Department, his “shambolic tariff policy” and said the White House every day delivers “lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like every day is Halloween, except it’s all tricks and no treats,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Nine years after leaving office, Obama remains the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate — a reality underscored by his high-profile appearances on the final weekend of two of 2025’s most important contests. Obama has also  stepped up his warnings  about what he says is the damage being wrought to the country by President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The crowd in Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday waited about five hours for Obama to speak, but that didn’t damper their enthusiasm. When Spanberger introduced Obama, the cheers for him were so loud you couldn’t hear her. The 7,000-seat arena was near capacity.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger sought to tie Tuesday’s election to a signal Democrats can send to the nation.\n \n\n   \n  “With the political turmoil coming out of Washington right now, this election is an opportunity, because in just three more days, when the polls close, Virginia voters can and will send a message. Amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington, Virginia can and will flip statewide seats from red to blue,” Spanberger said.\n \n\n   \n  The event served as an important base motivator on the last day of early voting.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m concerned about the deterioration of the country, the way people are treated. The sadness of everything that’s happening, it’s heartbreaking,” Gail Buchanan of Chesterfield, Virginia told CNN at the rally.\n \n\n   \n  Also of note, Virginia’s Democratic nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones, spoke though he was not listed as a planned speaker. Jones has been under fire for  violent language  he sent about a colleague in recently surfaced text messages in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Obama is the closer after a number of ambitious Democrats have  also hit the trail  for Sherrill and Spanberger. The list of Democratic governors to campaign with Spanberger and Sherrill includes Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Maryland’s Wes Moore, Illinois’ JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  Obama has slowly ramped up his involvement in both gubernatorial elections. He cut ads for both candidates that began airing in mid-October.\n \n\n   \n  After voting in Bridgewater on Friday, Ciattarelli — whose near miss in the 2021 New Jersey governor’s race was an early indicator of the state’s rightward shift in the 2024 presidential race, when Trump closed his losing margin from 16 percentage points in 2020 to 6 points last year — downplayed any impact Obama’s appearance with Sherrill might have in the closing days of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what I refer to as the choreography of campaigns, but at the end of day, I really believe this, particularly in New Jersey, a candidate has to win the race, and that’s why I get up and down the state every day and engage with people every day, shake hands every single day.” Ciattarelli said. “I think we’ve done that a hell of a lot better than my opponent.”\n \n\n   \n  The Virginia and New Jersey governor’s races, which are held a year after presidential elections, are widely viewed as an important gauge of the nation’s political mood almost a year into a new presidency. One year into Obama’s White House tenure, Republican Bob McDonnell’s win in Virginia and Chris Christie’s win in New Jersey offered previews of the red wave that was to come in the 2010 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger and Sherrill are favored in the blue-leaning states, but wins are no lock: Four years ago, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governor race; in New Jersey, Sherrill hasn’t been able to pull away after several public polls found her with a single-digit edge over Ciattarelli.\n \n\n   \n  Both of Obama’s Saturday stops — Newark and Norfolk — are in areas with significant Black populations. Over the last several election cycles he has appeared often with Virginia Democratic candidates at base-rallying events in the Hampton Roads region.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arlette Saenz, Eva McKend, Eric Fiegel﻿, Edward-Isaac Dovere and Dalia Abdelwahab contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5596121","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00-05:00","title":"SNAP Benefits Will Restart, But Will Be Half the Normal Payment and Delayed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has announced the restart of SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits after a federal government shutdown froze payments on November 1, 2025.

half the normal payment and delayed \n         By Maria Godoy, Jennifer Ludden \n        \n           Updated Monday, November 3, 2025 • 2:30 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration says it will restart SNAP food benefits but it will pay out only half the amount people normally get. The administration will use money from an Agriculture Department contingency fund. The administration says there's only $4.65 billion available in that fund to pay for SNAP benefits, which is roughly half of the $8 billion in food assistance payments people receive every month.   In a court filing, officials said depleting that fund means \"no funds will remain for new SNAP applicants certified in November, disaster assistance, or as a cushion against the potential catastrophic consequences of shutting down SNAP entirely.\" The Trump administration declined to tap any additional funds for SNAP saying that could take money away from other child nutrition programs, like school lunch and breakfast programs. The decision comes after two federal judges ruled that freezing payments for the country's biggest anti-hunger program is unlawful, even as the money ran out this weekend for the 42 million people who rely on SNAP to put food on the table. The government's response is part of the case in Rhode Island. The Trump administration had until Monday to tell two federal judges its plans to restore funding for SNAP amidst the ongoing federal government shutdown. The administration warns there could be lengthy delays before benefits get into the hands of low-income families who depend on SNAP to put food on the table. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       About 1 in 8 U.S. residents get an average of $187 a month per person in SNAP, which stands for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Nearly 39% of recipients are children and adolescents under 18 , according to the Department of Agriculture  (USDA), which administers the program. Courts tell Trump to use emergency funds Citing the government shutdown, USDA froze funding for SNAP beginning Nov. 1 — the first time that's happened since the country's largest anti-hunger program began six decades ago. On Friday, two federal judges ruled that this pause is likely unlawful. Both judges said that Congress provided more than $5 billion in emergency funds for exactly this kind of situation, and they  rejected the Trump administration's  argument that it could not legally use that money to keep SNAP going. It not only can use the money, but must, the judges said. In Rhode Island, Judge John McConnell Jr. called for the contingency funds to be used as soon as possible. A second judge, Indira Talwani in Boston, said officials could also tap additional money from customs revenues, but she left that decision up to the Trump administration — which it has declined to do. Democracy Forward, the legal group that represented cities and nonprofits in suing the government after it froze funding for SNAP, said Monday that it is weighing its next steps to try to secure full funding for the food assistance program. \"It shouldn't take a court order to force our President to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided,\" Democracy Forward President and CEO Skye Perryman said in a statement. \"But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people.\" After the rulings were issued Friday, Trump posted on social media that his lawyers would seek clarity from the court on how to fund SNAP. And if they got it, \"it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" Trump wrote. Treasury Secretary  Scott Bessent  told CNN Sunday that the Trump administration would not appeal the judges' ruling. He said it's possible that funding for SNAP \"could be\" restored by Wednesday, but \"there's a process that has to be followed. We've got to figure out what the process is.\" Delays and 'a logistical nightmare' A delay in benefits was expected regardless of the outcome of the court cases, because many beneficiaries have their cards recharged early in the month and the process of loading cards can take a week or more in many states.

Several states, including  Arkansas ,  New Hampshire  and  Washington , have also announced measures to help support food banks and pantries.

Others wish they could, too \n         By Yuki Noguchi \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 7:01 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Like many, many Americans, Scott Adams had health insurance problems. But Adams — made famous first by his long-running Dilbert cartoon, and later for  a racist rant  on  YouTube  — counts some powerful people in his social media circle: President Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. So Adams posted his complaint on X, saying Kaiser of Northern California, his health insurer and care provider, had \"dropped the ball\" in scheduling a procedure needed to treat  his metastatic prostate cancer.  Adams wrote he was going to ask Trump to help save his life, and he added: \"I am declining fast. I will ask President Trump if he can get Kaiser of Northern California to respond and schedule it for Monday.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Donald Trump Jr.  responded to the post on X first , saying: \"Going to make sure that my dad sees this.\" Just after 11 am on Sunday morning,  Kennedy responded , saying, \"Scott. How do I reach you? The President wants to help.\" Later that day, President Trump  posted a screen shot of Adams' original post and responded   \"On it!\" on his favored social media platform, Truth Social. And on Monday, Adams posted that he  had an appointment  to receive the infusion he needed of the cancer drug, Pluvicto, on Tuesday. \"For context, I waited months for the drug, like everyone else,\" Adams wrote. \"But I think my files got misplaced or something and that glitch just got corrected. Not sure.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The U.S. health care system is notoriously complex, confusing and expensive, and many Americans have had similarly frustrating experiences as Adams did. Few, though, have the social media reach to enlist such powerful helping hands. \"Our health system shouldn't be one where we need the intervention of the president or the HHS secretary to weigh in on behalf of a high-profile political backer,\" said Anthony Wright, the executive director of  Families USA , a health care advocacy organization. Wright added that he is gratified Adams got the help he needed and said it should be available to all. \"Glad the President is offering to do casework,\" Wright said, noting that federal workers who do similar problem solving have been fired and navigators who help people sign up for Affordable Care Act health insurance have been cut by 90%. Wright also called out the\" \" current shutdown over the issue of tax credits  that help millions access and afford health care.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       NPR reached out to Kaiser for comment and they e-mailed this statement: \"Mr. Adams' oncology team is working closely with him on the next steps in his cancer care, which are already underway. Since it was approved by the FDA three years ago, Kaiser Permanente's nuclear medicine and medical oncology experts have treated more than 150 patients with Lu-177 PSMA (Pluvicto) in Northern California alone. We know this drug and this disease.\" Adams' experience drummed up a chorus of well-wishes online, as well as those who called out the preferential treatment he apparently got. \"There are Americans all over America who are currently going through similar circumstances,\" wrote  one X poster , responding to Kennedy's offer to help Adams. Another responded : \"How about promoting UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, like the rest of the Industrialized 1st World Nations, so EVERYONE can be treated, not just Celebrity & the Wealthy?\" In the shutdown health care fight that started Oct. 1, about 24 million Americans who buy their insurance on the ACA marketplaces will see their premiums skyrocket — the average plan  will double  in price — if Congress doesn't act. Democrats say they will not reopen the government unless the tax subsidies that bring down the cost are renewed. Republicans say they will not discuss renewing the subsidies until the government is reopened. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591157","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:54:00-05:00","title":"Public Workers Could Be Denied Loan Forgiveness If Cities Defy Trump, Lawsuit Alleges","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Education's proposed rule change to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, effective July 1, 2026, threatens to deny loan forgiveness to public workers whose employers engage in activities with a 'substantial illegal purpose'.

\n           Updated Monday, November 3, 2025 • 12:54 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The cities of Albuquerque, N.M., Boston, Chicago and San Francisco are suing the Trump administration over changes it plans to make to the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, or PSLF. The lawsuit, which also includes the nation's two largest teachers unions and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, comes less than a week after the U.S. Department of Education  published a rule change  to PSLF. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Effective July 1, 2026, the department says the change will allow it to deny loan forgiveness to workers whose government or nonprofit employers engage in activities with a \"substantial illegal purpose.\" The job of defining \"substantial illegal purpose\" will fall not to the courts but to the education secretary. PSLF was created by Congress in 2007, and signed by then-President George W. Bush, to cancel the federal student loan debts of borrowers who spend a decade working in public service, including teaching, nursing and policing. According to the lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the plaintiffs fear that a city or county government's resistance to the administration's immigration actions, for example, or anti-DEI policies, could lead the secretary to exclude that government's public workers from loan forgiveness. They worry that a local nurse or first responder could be denied loan forgiveness because their local leaders defied the Trump administration. The complaint argues the rule is \"an attempt to target organizations and jurisdictions whose missions and policies do not align with [the Trump administration's] political positions on immigration, race, gender, free speech, and public protest.\" \"Politically motivated retaliation, like what the administration has done here, should have no place in America,\" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs. The plaintiff group also includes the National Council of Nonprofits, which  said in a statement  upon the rule's release: \"Nonprofits operate food banks, serve veterans, assist domestic violence survivors, deliver meals to seniors, respond to disasters, and much more. Nonprofits must be able to identify and meet those needs without political interference, fear of retribution, or exclusion from a program designed to support their employees.\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent denounced the lawsuit.  \"It is unconscionable that the plaintiffs are standing up for criminal activity,\" Kent said in a statement to NPR. \"This is a commonsense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking, and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm to children.\" In response to plaintiffs' concerns that the administration could use PSLF as a weapon to punish political opponents, Kent insisted \"the Department will enforce [the rule] neutrally, without consideration of the employer's mission, ideology, or the population they serve.\" The complaint says PSLF has allowed local governments to retain employees, including lawyers and engineers, who could earn more in the private sector. Albuquerque's leaders say that losing access to PSLF \"would likely create an untenable staffing crisis.\" In a statement, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu added: \"The City is joining with cities, unions, and nonprofits across the country to protect a program that helps Boston's workforce and millions of Americans in public service careers pay for college.\" What activities does the administration consider to be illegal?  One key question raised by this rule change, and the lawsuit, is: How will the Education Department define activities with \"substantial illegal purpose\"? According to the rule itself, such activities could include: \"aiding and abetting violations of Federal immigration laws\" \"supporting terrorism or engaging in violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing Federal Government policy\" \"engaging in the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children in violation of Federal or state law\" \"engaging in the trafficking of children to another State for purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents in violation of Federal or State law\" \"engaging in a pattern of aiding and abetting illegal discrimination\" \"and engaging in a pattern of violating State laws.\" If the secretary determines that an employer has behaved with \"substantial illegal purpose,\" according to the rule, the employer can either engage with the department and accept a corrective action plan or risk losing access to PSLF for its employees for 10 years. In response to public comments, the Education Department  has said , \"[it] would have no basis to remove eligibility from nonprofits engaged in work related to immigrant communities, LGBTQ+ individuals, or racial justice if those organizations are following the law.\" But the plaintiff cities, which sit on the U.S. Justice Department's  \"sanctuary jurisdictions\"  list, say the Trump administration has already accused them of impeding the enforcement of federal law, and that this rule \"represents yet another attack on politically disfavored local governments and nonprofits that have local laws, policies, and missions that are anathemas to the Administration.\" \"The actions of these cities are legal,\" says Persis Yu, of Protect Borrowers, another organization representing the plaintiffs. What's more, she says, \"whether or not these activities are legal, is not a [determination] that the secretary of education has either the right or the expertise to be making.\"   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The new rule is the culmination of  a presidential action , issued in March, in which President Trump accused the Biden administration of abusing PSLF, and said the program \"has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.\" What did Congress intend when it created PSLF?  The plaintiffs argue Congress was clear about what should qualify as \"public service\" when it wrote the law, and that this new rule goes against lawmakers' intent. \"The Higher Education Act defines public service jobs as including government or a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization. It does not provide any discretion or wiggle room within that definition,\" Yu says. \"Congress has said that this is who is entitled to public service loan forgiveness. The secretary doesn't have the authority to change that.\" In response to public comments, the Education Department has  disagreed , writing that \"[it] rejects the suggestion that this rule exceeds its legal authority. The [Higher Education Act] grants the Secretary explicit power to regulate title IV programs. PSLF is a title IV program, and its proper administration requires clear, enforceable standards.\" Another lawsuit was filed in tandem Monday, by a coalition of 21 state attorneys general, arguing on behalf of Democratic-leaning state governments that worry their public employees could likewise be denied loan forgiveness because of state leaders' decisions to support immigrants, promote DEI or provide gender affirming care.  The coalition of attorneys general warned in a press release that the rule would result in \"widespread confusion, fear, and instability in the public workforce, forcing states to confront severe staffing shortages, higher turnover, and skyrocketing costs to maintain essential services.\"  According to federal data, more than 1.1 million public service workers have thus far had their federal student loan debts discharged under PSLF.  This story was updated to include comment from the U.S. Department of Education. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5593112","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump's National Guard deployments aren't random.

They were planned years ago \n         By Kat Lonsdorf \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump's deployments of National Guard troops to U.S. cities have outraged his political rivals, tested legal precedents and led to nationwide protests. The courts are weighing in on their legality. But — if successful — they could also fulfill a long-running administration goal of employing America's military to aid in the mass deportation of immigrants without legal status, according to an NPR review of past comments from Trump and his allies. It's a  move that would stray significantly  from past federal use of the Guard, challenging laws that dictate how the U.S. military can be used domestically. And with the 2026 midterms looming, some experts worry Guard troops could even be used as a tool of systemic voter suppression and intimidation. Trump has sent troops into  four Democratic-led cities  and threatened to send them to several more, claiming they are needed to crack down on crime and protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments, and the White House's rhetoric around them, have  regularly conflated violent crime and illegal immigration  into a single crisis, blurring the lines around the role of the Guard and federal agents. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Taken one at a time, the deployments can seem random or fickle — Trump will often muse about sending troops into a city,  only to back track his comments  and focus on a different city days later. But the president and several others in his inner circle — most notably Stephen Miller,   a senior aide to Trump in his first term, and now Trump's  right hand man on immigration  — have long talked about using the National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration raids, despite U.S. laws broadly preventing the military from being used for domestic policing. To get around those laws, both Trump and Miller have talked about invoking the  Insurrection Act , which allows the president to deploy the military within the U.S. in certain situations. Legal experts, activists and watchdog groups worry the Trump administration could fundamentally change the way the military is used on U.S. soil, specifically raising concerns about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what armed troops on the streets could mean as voters cast ballots. Laying the groundwork Much of Trump's campaign ahead of the 2024 election was focused on drumming up anti-immigrant sentiment and pushing his plan for mass deportations. He vowed several times on the campaign trail that he would launch the  largest deportation operation  in American history. In his first term, Trump and his administration had similar ambitions, but  struggled to scale up infrastructure and manpower  needed to carry out the goal. In a  TIME Magazine interview  in April of 2024, then-candidate Trump was asked specifically if his plan included the use of the U.S. military. \"I can see myself using the National Guard and, if necessary, I'd have to go a step further. We have to do whatever we have to do to stop the problem we have,\" Trump responded. Using the National Guard for immigration enforcement is an idea that Miller had talked about publicly in the years before. In 2023, Miller appeared on the late right-wing activist  Charlie Kirk's podcast  to talk about how mass deportations under Trump's hopeful second term could work. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"In terms of personnel, you go to the red state governors, and you say, give us your National Guard. We will deputize them as immigration enforcement officers,\" Miller explained. \"The Alabama National Guard is going to arrest illegal aliens in Alabama, and the Virginia National Guard in Virginia.\" Miller doesn't specify how that would be legal — under U.S. law, the military can't be used for domestic policing unless authorized by the Constitution or Congress. For Democratic-run states that don't comply, Miller said, the federal government would simply send the National Guard from a nearby Republican-run state. The deployments In recent months, the Trump administration has deployed Guard troops to states against the wishes of their Democratic governors — including sending troops from Texas into Illinois. The administration said their purpose was to protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments are tied up in court challenges. Miles Taylor, former chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's first term, worked closely with Miller. He's since become a vocal critic of the president and his policies. Taylor says he's not surprised to see Miller's plan coming to fruition. \"Trump was deeply deferential to Stephen and I think you've seen that with a vastly more empowered Stephen Miller in a second term,\" says Taylor, an author and commentator. Taylor says that during Trump's first term, the president wasn't talking publicly about using the U.S. military for immigration enforcement, but it was something that was discussed behind closed doors. \"I can remember in meetings with him in the Oval Office, or on Air Force One, or at the border, him starting to bring up this idea of using the United States military to solve the problem,\" he says. It wasn't something that Trump just talked about. In 2017,  The Associated Press reported  on a memo it obtained from DHS, outlining a draft proposal to use the National Guard to round up unauthorized immigrants throughout the U.S. At the time, the White House denied it, saying there was no such plan. Taylor says there very much was — but it was also more than that. \"It was the invocation of the Insurrection Act to deputize the military to enforce domestic law to basically become a domestic police force,\" he says, noting that this particular idea was something that troubled him and several other staffers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It rocked us to our core,\" he says. Trump invoking the Insurrection Act would legally allow for the military to act as police on U.S. soil — to carry out immigration enforcement, but possibly other enforcement too, according to legal experts. NPR asked the White House about potential plans to deputize the Guard for law enforcement and to use the Insurrection Act, but it did not directly respond to those questions, instead criticizing Taylor and NPR. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson also referenced Trump's \"highly successful operations to drive down violent crime in American cities.\" Project 2025 The broader themes of these National Guard deployments are also embedded in  Project 2025 , a conservative action plan written by the Heritage Foundation after Trump's first term that's more than 900 pages long. Trump has incorporated many of its policies, and authors into his second administration. So much so that the report's architect, Russell Vought, is the head of the White House's Office of Management and Budget. Matt Dallek, a professor at The George Washington University who studies the American conservative movement, says that Project 2025 essentially opens the door for Trump's National Guard deployments — particularly to Democratic-led cities — without explicitly calling for them. \"The subtext of Project 2025 is to take any and all steps at the executive level to go into cities and states to enact the priority — which is to root out illegal immigration,\" Dallek says. The idea of bullying states and cities into following orders from the president is a key part of the text, says David Graham, a journalist for The Atlantic  who also wrote a book on the project . So is the use of the military. \"There is this idea in Project 2025, and among the authors, that the military is just an underused resource for policing immigration,\" Graham says, noting that often illegal immigration is presented as a national security problem. He says the report's authors believe that the U.S. has \"this huge, huge resource of armed people, and we're not doing anything with it, and we need to use it to secure the border.\" Beyond mass deportation In recent weeks, Trump has talked about  invoking the Insurrection Act often , especially in regard to deploying the National Guard. Earlier this month, he said that he was \"allowed\" to invoke it if the courts deny his deployments in places like Portland, Ore., or Chicago, where prosecutors and federal judges have questioned the need for troops on the ground. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump invoking the Insurrection Act to allow troops to help with immigration enforcement is also something that Stephen Miller has talked about. He  told the New York Times  back in 2023: \"President Trump will do whatever it takes.\" That possibility has both legal experts and immigration advocates worried, especially about the implications it could have for Americans at large. Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, an immigration rights advocacy group, says it has her worried about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what the presence of troops might mean for voters as they cast ballots. \"What I have said repeatedly is that the path to authoritarianism in this country is being built on the backs of immigrants. They will begin with immigrants. They will not end with immigrants,\" she says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590198","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"To optimize health, sync your habits with your body clock.

To optimize health, sync your habits with your body clock. Here's how \n         By Allison Aubrey \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The return to \"standard time\" is better for our health according to sleep scientists, but the time change can be disruptive, and our bodies must also adjust to more hours of darkness as we head towards winter. The body is an exquisite time-keeping machine. And growing evidence shows that if you align your daily habits with  your circadian rhythms  — including when you sleep, eat, and exercise — you can help fend off chronic disease and optimize good health. Let's start with a quick primer: \"Your body is filled with clocks,\" explains  Emily Manoogian , a researcher and chronobiologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. In addition to the master clock in your brain, there are time-keeping mechanisms in every organ and in your cells. \"Every cell in your body that has DNA has a molecular clock that keeps its own time,\" she says. They're all part of your body's circadian system helping you stay in sync with the 24-hour cycle. But our bodies don't keep perfect time on their own. Every day, we stray a bit from the 24-hour cycle, and need a reset, explains Salk Institute researcher  Satchin Panda , author of  The Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy, and Transform Your Health from Morning to Midnight.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The master clock in your brain coordinates all the other clocks through a series of different cues,\" Manoogian explains, including external cues — such as light, food, and movement. And that's why the timing of our habits can play a pivotal role in keeping our clocks in sync. Light from the sun serves as the external cue to resynchronize the master clock. That's why it's helpful to open the blinds in the morning and spend time outdoors. And, it turns out, our first bite of food each day also works as an external cue to sync the clocks in our digestive system and throughout our bodies. \"Food is also a signal to reset the clocks, especially your gut,\" Manoogian says. \"That's one of the reasons why making sure you're eating at the right time relative to light is important.\" Eating is a cue to wake up your digestive and metabolic organs, which are primed to function best during the day. By nighttime, the metabolic system is ready for rest, too. \"When you're asleep, your body expects to fast. And so it shuts down the part of the system that captures glucose from the blood and stores it away,\" she explains. When people eat too close to bedtime or in the middle of the night, their metabolic organs aren't optimized to do their job. The misalignment can lead to poor blood sugar control. Her research shows that restricting the number of hours you eat during a day to about a 10 hour window, can lead to significant improvements in metabolic health. There's lots of evidence that eating out of sync with your circadian rhythms can increase the risk of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. Studies show that shift workers who work rotating, overnight  shifts have a higher risk  of developing these conditions due, in part, to the disruption of the natural rhythms. And when it comes to exercise, some people find they do best in the morning, others in the afternoon, says  Dr. Phyliss Zee , director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. But the science shows exercising late at night, just before bed can disrupt sleep. \"There's a peak time for almost every physiological process,\" Zee says. \"The timing of feeding, the time that you exercise, the physical activity, all of these help entrain the clocks in your body so that they're in sync,\" she says. If you eat dinner and go to bed around the same time most nights, your 'creature of habit' ways could pay off. \"The science shows that regularity is very important for the circadian system and for health,\" Zee says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And while each person is unique she says,  a general rule of thumb is to begin limiting exposure to light, food and heavy exercise starting a few hours before bedtime. But as scientists have learned more about the importance of keeping our biological clocks in sync, society has moved in the opposite direction. Manoogian points to advertisements for midnight food menus, and around the clock work and entertainment as examples of our 24/7 modern life. One way to push back is to track your daily habits. Michelle Pittsley, who lives in Vista, Calif., started using an app called  myCircadianClock  to log her eating and blood sugar. She says it helped her stick to a \"time-restricted eating\" window and helped her track her progress. The app was developed by Salk scientists as a research tool, and is used in Salk Institute studies. It's free to any adult who downloads it. The app provides guidance on when to sleep, eat, and exercise. (Note: if you sign up, you're sharing data with researchers.) When we have \"broken\" circadian rhythms, the risk for chronic disease rises, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, gut diseases and common cancers, say Panda and Manoogian. If you want to be more intentional about aligning your habits for better health, here are three strategies to try. 1. Drop the late night snack, and limit the hours you eat. People who restrict their eating to a ten hour window can reduce their risk of Type 2 diabetes, Manoogian says. She and Panda co-authored a study of 108 adults, average age 59, who had symptoms of metabolic disease. They found those who followed time-restricted eating saw a significant  reduction in their hemoglobin A1c  (which is a person's average glucose level over a few months), compared to participants who did not restrict their eating window. Participants were not asked to reduce calories, only to restrict the eating window for a period of three months. \"It was exciting to see that just the time restricted eating was able to reduce their risk for Type 2 diabetes by 60%,\" Manoogian says, because the reduction in blood sugar, if maintained, reduces the risk of the disease. Research also suggests that eating your biggest meal of the day in the afternoon, as opposed to later in the evening can be beneficial for those who want to lose weight. A study from Spain found  early eaters lost 25 percent more weight  than late eaters. Panda says when his mother gave up a late night snack that included tea with sugar and milk and an occasional snack, that one change led to a significant drop in her blood sugar levels. 2. Go to bed about the same time most nights  \"Keeping the same sleep schedule is optimal,\" Manoogian says. The consistency gives your body a chance to anticipate and keep internal clocks synchronized. During sleep,  waste is cleared out of our brains , and  memories are consolidated , and there's a pile of evidence to show rest is critical for our health. But don't beat yourself up when you have a late night out. And of course, there will be disruptions due to travel, work deadlines or weekend celebrations. \"Going off your circadian system is not like breaking an arm,\" Manoogian says. Think of the harms of erratic schedules akin to the way dripping water can erode stone. \"Little hits, time after time, can wear down the system,\" she says. And the result is you can feel slower and older. There are  lots of bedtime rituals  to foster a good night's sleep, including limiting light before bed and sleeping in darkness. Zee's research shows  even small amounts of light  while sleeping  can have adverse effects on cardiovascular and metabolic health. 3. Time exercise to your 'sweet spot,' but not too late at night    Whether you're a morning lark or a night owl can influence the ideal time for you to exercise, so this will vary from person to person, Zee says. \"The better time to exercise depends, in part, on what we call your chronotype,\" she says, which is a person's innate preference for timing of sleep or when they feel more alert and energetic. One way to estimate your tendency is with a  Morningness-Eveningness  questionnaire. \"If you're a morning person, then morning exercise can be beneficial,\" creating a consistent structure, Zee says, but people who grow more alert later in the day, may want to put it off until later. As people juggle competing obligations, exercise may be shoehorned into the time it fits on your calendar, even if it's not your body clock's preferred window. She says it's important to remember that exercise is beneficial, no matter what time you do it. But keep this in mind: \"Exercise is a stimulatory cue to tell your body you should be awake,\" Manoogian says, so it's not a surprise that  recent research  shows that exercise just before sleep can  disrupt sleep quality  . \n         \n         Transcript \n         STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Most of us are now back to standard time after winding back the clock this weekend, metaphorically, in most cases. My mom almost forgot, but got an extra hour of sleep, as it turned out. NPR's Allison Aubrey reports on one strategy to adjust our internal clocks to the dark days ahead. ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: Our bodies don't keep perfect time on their own. Each day we stray a bit from the 24-hour cycle. That's why exposure to light is so helpful. Light is the cue to reset the master clock in the brain, explains Emily Manoogian, a chronobiologist at the Salk Institute. EMILY MANOOGIAN: Your body is filled with clocks. Every cell in your body that has DNA has a molecular clock that keeps its own time. AUBREY: It's a very elaborate system that can influence your health in a profound way. She says the challenge is that our clocks can get out of sync, and it's up to us to choose habits to help keep them in rhythm. MANOOGIAN: The master clock in your brain coordinates all of those other clocks through a series of different external cues we take in by getting light, by getting food, by getting exercise, by telling your clocks what time of day it is. AUBREY: That's why the timing of the first bite of food you eat each day is important. MANOOGIAN: Light is really the biggest stimulus to reset the clocks in your brain, but food is a bigger signal to reset the clocks throughout your body, especially your gut. And so that's one of the reasons why making sure you're eating at the right time relative to light is important. AUBREY: Eating early in the day is a cue to wake up your digestive organs. But by nighttime, the metabolic system is ready for rest. MANOOGIAN: When you're sleeping, your body expects a fast, and so it kind of shuts down the part of the system that captures glucose for the blood and stores it away. So if you eat in the middle of the night, then your body can't process that. AUBREY: And that can set the stage for metabolic disease, including diabetes and obesity. As scientists have learned more about the importance of keeping our biological clocks in sync, society has moved in the opposite direction. MANOOGIAN: We just kind of completely ignore our circadian rhythms. We have light really late at night. There's advertisements for midnight food menus, all kinds of extremes of working around the clock and being awake and entertaining yourself around the clock. AUBREY: When Manoogian and her colleagues did a study of people at risk of metabolic disease, those who were able to restrict their eating to a 10-hour window saw a significant drop in blood sugar without being asked to cut calories. MANOOGIAN: It was exciting to see that just the time-restricted eating was able to reduce their risk for Type 2 diabetes by 60%. AUBREY: The changes can be as simple as eating dinner earlier and skipping an evening snack, but you've got to stick with it to maintain the benefits. Dr. Phyllis Zee is director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Medicine at Northwestern University. She says when it comes to exercise, morning is best for some - others, afternoon - but the science shows exercising late at night just before bed can disrupt sleep. PHYLLIS ZEE: There's a peak time for almost every physiological process - the timing of feeding, the timing that you exercise, the physical activity, all of these help and train the clocks in your body so that they're really in sync. AUBREY: If you eat dinner and go to bed at the same time most nights, your creature-of-habit ways could pay off. ZEE: The recent science shows that regularity is very important for the circadian system and for health. AUBREY: Lowering your risks of chronic disease and boosting your sense of well-being.

\n         By Anthony Kuhn \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 5:03 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. AKITA, Japan — Young men in traditional festival clothes balance heavy bamboo poles up to 40 feet high on their heads, hands, hips and shoulders. Crossbars on the poles carry dozens of candlelit paper lanterns. Part ritual, part festival and part competition,   kanto  is a centuries-old display of strength, skill and culture unique to Akita Prefecture, in northern Japan's Tohoku region. Traditionally, only men are allowed to touch the poles. Women play flutes and drums. Kanto practitioners believe that women cannot participate because, according to Japan's Shinto religion, women's blood from menstruation and childbirth is considered impure for the purpose of religious rituals. Some Japanese women accept Kanto's gender divisions as part of the culture, or simply refrain from criticizing them. College student Mayaka Ogawa, for example, says, \"We can't really argue against tradition and religious reasons.\" Kanto is emblematic of both Akita's cultural splendor and its conservative rural society. And Akita itself is emblematic of Japan's 21st century demographic challenges: It has the most aged   population  (39% were over age 65 in 2024), the lowest birth rate and the fastest declining population of Japan's 47 prefectures, according to government figures. Gender inequality is accelerating depopulation in rural areas like this. Rural women flee gender inequality A Japanese government  report  on inequality published in June found that 27% of young women want to leave their hometowns, compared to 15% of young men — and rigid gender roles in rural society are prompting young women to vote with their feet. The survey shows that most women move to the cities in search of better employment opportunities — but there's a gender angle to that, too. Widespread expectations that women will prioritize housework and childcare also diminish young women's educational prospects, motivating them to leave rural areas.  In rural communities, \"women are stuck in temporary or part-time jobs and only men get promoted. Women don't want to work in these places, so they move to Tokyo,\" says Chuo University sociologist Masahiro Yamada. The problem is persistent, he says, because \"middle-aged and older men in rural areas don't want to change the current situation of discrimination against women.\" While last month's selection of Sanae Takaichi as Japan's first female prime minister breaks an important glass ceiling, she advocates a conservative, traditional view of gender roles. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Japanese women's political empowerment ranks 125th out of 148 countries in the  World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Report  for 2025. A   study  last year found that 744 Japanese municipalities, or 43% of the total, mostly in rural areas, are at risk of disappearing because their proportion of women of childbearing age are expected to drop by half by mid-century. But the effects of depopulation in Japan are already impossible to miss. Hundreds of thousands of jobs go unfilled due to  labor shortages . Millions of homes stand  vacant  or abandoned. Making women's voices heard While the exodus of rural women continues, some women stay put or return to rural areas to try to improve them. Ren Yamamoto  wanted to make young rural women's voices heard. So the 26-year-old resident of Nirasaki, a city in Yamanashi Prefecture — home to Mount Fuji and some 80 miles west of Tokyo — taped 100 interviews with rural women and started her own YouTube  channel . Many of her interviewees told her \"when they go back to their hometowns, they're asked: 'when are you getting married? when are you going to have children?' and they're sick of being forced into such a role,\" she says. Japan's public broadcaster NHK  reported  on her project. Earlier this year, then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba invited her to  meet  with him. \"Policies to support women have been centered on childcare and marriage, without addressing the reasons why women leave rural areas,\" Yamamoto told Ishiba. \"Policymakers haven't faced the fact that women have their own choices to make. We feel like we're seen as baby-making machines.\" Ishiba told Yamamoto he was trying to improve the situation, but it was tough because local officials are overwhelmingly middle-aged men. The government searches for policy fixes Japan's government has pointed out that the issues of gender equality and falling birthrate are inseparably linked. Central and local authorities are trying various  policies  to address both issues. Some local governments, including  Tokyo's  and Akita's, serve as matchmakers to try to increase marriages and births. \"I hate that,\" exclaims Mayaka Ogawa, the Akita college student. \"It almost comes across as women can't do it for themselves.\" She adds: \"Women are starting to awaken to the fact that they don't really need to form a family in order to be fulfilled.\" On a recent weekend, a handful of mostly middle-aged women attended a lecture in Akita, where an \"assertiveness trainer\" coached them on how to convince husbands to help more with housework and childcare. A poster for the event shows drawings of smiling men ironing laundry and cradling children. \"Even though so many people across Japan are putting in so much effort [toward gender equality], we still find ourselves in a situation where progress is painfully slow,\" says Naoko Tani, director of the Akita Prefectural Central Gender Equality Center, which hosted the lecture. Gnawing unease and pessimism Some Akita women say they suffer from  moya moya , a vague, gnawing sense that things aren't right, but they can't put their finger on it. Taboos against challenging gender roles and male authority thicken the fog of  moya moya . Tani says she too once suffered from this confusion, but \"through learning about things from a gender perspective, there were moments when things suddenly clicked for me — when I thought, 'Ah, so this is what it's about.' And at those times, the realization moved me to tears.\" Others are just moved to leave and not look back. \"Akita is often called an isolated island on land,\" says high school student Yukina Oguma, whose family are hereditary managers of a Buddhist temple in Akita. She plans to go to college in another prefecture. Asked what she would do if she were told or expected to stay in Akita and take over the temple, she replies, \"I would run away.\" Some women are pessimistic about improving gender equality in Akita anytime soon. \"Let Akita be depopulated. There is no way of stopping it, honestly speaking,\" argues college student Miwa Sawano. \"They won't realize they have a problem until the women leave.\" Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report in Tokyo and Yamanashi and Akita Prefectures. \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   Japan has more elderly adults than any major nation, and it is losing nearly a million people a year. By mid-century, an estimated 750 towns and villages may vanish from the map. One of the surest indicators of a village's slide toward extinction is when young women start leaving. NPR's Anthony Kuhn explains. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in non-English language). ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Crowds cheer as young men balance bamboo poles up to 40-feet high with lanterns on their hands, heads, hips and shoulders. It's a centuries-old tradition unique to Japan's Akita Prefecture. Only men are allowed to touch the poles and be sashite, or pole carriers. The women play flutes and drums. One pole carrier is New Zealand college student, Raz Tripp (ph). He says Kanto is rooted in Japan's Shinto religion. RAZ TRIPP: The reason only men can be sashite is because the goddess resides in the pole, and she doesn't like being touched by women. She gets jealous. KUHN: Miwa Sawano (ph) is a college senior and former Kanto club member. She accepts Kanto's gender roles as part of Akita's traditional culture, but she objects to the club's drinking parties with local residents. MIWA SAWANO: (Through interpreter) Things like sexual harassment happen. Kanto performers wear shorts, and girls' legs get touched a lot by the local men. KUHN: Akita has the most aged population, the lowest birth rate and the fastest rate of population decline of Japan's 47 prefectures. A government report in June said that many women are leaving rural areas due to rigid gender roles there. Even more leave for better jobs, but Chuo University sociologist Masahiro Yamada says there's a gender angle to that too. MASAHIRO YAMADA: (Through interpreter) Middle-aged and older men in rural areas don't want to change the current situation of discrimination against women, where women are stuck in temporary or part-time jobs and only men get promoted. Women don't want to work in these places, so they move to Tokyo. KUHN: But some women stay in or return to their hometowns to try to improve them. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC) KUHN: I met one such person in Nirasaki, a small city of about 28,000 people, some 80 miles west of Tokyo in Yamanashi Prefecture. So it's about 1 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon, and this is the main street of Nirasaki. And there's a fair amount of traffic, but most of the storefronts and shops here are shuttered. Twenty-six-year-old Ren Yamamoto (ph) wanted to make young, rural women's voices heard. She taped a hundred interviews and posted them on YouTube. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Japanese). REN YAMAMOTO: (Through interpreter) Lots of them said that when they go back to their hometowns, they feel pressure because they're asked, when are you getting married? When are you going to have children? And they're sick of being forced into such a role. KUHN: Yamamoto put the issue of gender inequality and depopulation on the map. Public broadcaster NHK reported on her project. Later, then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba invited her to meet with him. Yamamoto told Ishiba that government policies are missing the mark. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) YAMAMOTO: (Through interpreter) Policies to support women have been centered on child care and marriage without addressing the reasons why women leave rural areas. Policymakers haven't faced the fact that women have their own choices to make. We feel like we're seen as baby-making machines. KUHN: Japanese women's political empowerment ranks 125th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Report for 2025. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUMS AND FLUTE PLAYING) KUHN: Back in Akita, kids try drumming as the Kanto performance wraps up. Many women are pessimistic about changing Akita's conservative traditional culture. Independent Akita journalist Miwako Miura (ph) says her local newspaper boss told her not to report on gender inequality. MIWAKO MIURA: (Through interpreter) The deeper you go into rural areas, the more people try to not talk about gender issues. People are afraid that if they say something that crosses the line, they'll be criticized. It's a taboo. KUHN: Some rural women complain of what they call in Japanese moyamoya (ph). It's a vague feeling that something is wrong, but you can't quite put your finger on it. Often, it's enough to make women leave the countryside. College senior Miwa Sawano says let them go. SAWANO: (Through interpreter) Let Akita be depopulated. There's no way of stopping it, honestly speaking. They won't realize they have a problem until the women leave. KUHN: Sawano adds that women should not have to suffer oppression in the name of preserving traditional culture.

  By Melissa Ann Pinney , NPR Staff \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 9:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Melissa Ann Pinney photographed the everyday moments of adolescence inside Chicago Public Schools during a seven-year artist residency. Her series  Becoming Themselves  portrays students, especially those marginalized and underrepresented, as they navigate identity, community and the many transformations of growing up. We interviewed Pinney about the making of her series and the stories behind some of her favorite images. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. What drew you to photograph inside Chicago Public Schools? I was invited by Artists in Public Schools, an organization that pairs artists for residencies in schools all over the city, to photograph Bell School and Ogden International Schools. It was an incredible opportunity to photograph and immerse myself in often overlooked communities of children and teens in Chicago. Since I was in my teens and photographing my own family, childhood and adolescence has been a focus of my work.  Girl Ascending , my 2010 monograph, explored the social lives and coming-of-age rituals of my daughter, Emma, her friends and teammates. The possibilities inherent in widening the scope of my work beyond these established personal connections was exciting. When you first started, what kinds of images or stories did you hope to capture? I'm interested in photography as a process, one of paying close attention to the richness and mystery already present in the everyday world. I capture what's happening in the moment, and the story reveals itself afterwards in contemplation of the work itself. This is an opportunity to make what I think of as real pictures — images that reward sustained and repeated viewings and eschew stereotype and cliché. I had no idea what to expect in the schools, but through trial and error, I found opportunities to make pictures as I became part of the school community. I never know what the students will do next — their beauty, their compassion and their conflicts are unrehearsed. The teens collaborate in the art-making by welcoming me into their world. My photographs are both documents of a time and place and works of art. References to contemporary culture, to history and to ideas of representation are all embedded in the pictures. When I began photographing students in three different Chicago public schools, I had no idea of what was to come — how the project would evolve and shift through an ongoing global pandemic, a renewed focus on systemic racial and gender inequities and rampant gun violence. Now it's a document of a historic time. How much time did you spend working on  Becoming Themselves ? This project is ongoing and still evolving since 2018, when I started photographing in Bell School.  In Their Own Light  was the first book of my early pictures from an elementary, middle and several high schools. In  Becoming Themselves,  I   focus solely on two high schools — Ogden International High School and Senn High School — between 2019 and 2025. What was the most challenging part of this project? It is very hard to witness the grief and ongoing trauma many students experience as part of their everyday lives, especially when we hear that a student in the community has been shot and killed. Tragically, eight students I photographed died that way. The trauma of gun violence reverberates everywhere. What's the story behind one of your favorite photographs? With her My Little Pony leggings and arms loaded with jewelry, Lizzie Williams clearly stood out in the hallway crowded with students at their lockers gathering their coats and bags. I introduced myself and asked if Lizzie wanted to make a portrait. We went to the old gym for its brilliant light and huge south-facing windows. In the midst of working out Lizzie's pose and position, the boys basketball team starting running laps around the gym, casting shadows onto the wall where Lizzie stood. At first I was annoyed by this unexpected disruption, but I soon realized that, far from an unwelcome distraction, the shadows suggest another level of mystery and complexity. I'm grateful for serendipity! The DePaul University Art Museum added this photograph and six others from the project to their permanent collection last spring. A class of Senn students, many of whom are represented in the photographs, took a field trip to the museum to see the works. Were there any moments that surprised you during the process? Many moments surprised me. One day early last fall, a student I hadn't met before asked me to take his picture. I was happy to do so and we found a place by the windows with some light. When I looked through my lens, I suddenly recognized Axle, a student I'd first met two years before, when he transferred to Senn. I had photographed him several other times. Axle had transformed himself radically with a new short hair cut and different style of dress. I am always surprised and moved when a student tells me that the project made a positive impact on their life. Travion Williams, at Ogden International High School, said he was shy, self-conscious and unsure of himself when we made his portrait in 2019. Travion's portrait was one of the 84 portraits installed on panels in the school's front lobby in the summer of 2020. Classes would be completely online that fall, but outdoor sports were still allowed. When the cross country team started practicing, Travion discovered that his friends and teammates recognized and admired him. It changed the way he saw himself. It's rewarding when I'm told by a student that my work is important to them. As my ties to the community have deepened — I've come to understand the meaning this project holds for me and for the students themselves, who tell me they feel truly \"seen\" by participating in the project. The students have profoundly affected the ways I understand the lives of others; my relationships now transcend school to include family events, parties and baby showers. I couldn't have predicted the strong connections I would develop with some of the students, who keep in touch even years after they've graduated. When I brought Sophiat Agboola a print of her portrait, she told me it was inspiring. Surprised, I asked in what way it was inspiring and to whom — I couldn't guess. Sophiat said she had occasionally been made fun of for wearing her natural hair; her portrait had given her the confidence to do so. Of course, the pandemic surprised me. And the fact that a project I expected to last one year could still be challenging and rewarding after seven was a complete surprise, too. Do you have any memorable anecdotes or encounters from your time in the schools ? I photographed Jakolbi Lard only once, at prom in 2019, drawn by the broken heart he had shaved in to his hair. In January 2022, I learned that Jakolbi had been shot and killed. Jakolbi's death and the passage of time bring a different perspective to the broken heart shaved into his scalp. Now I see the wings formed by the mirror frame behind Jakolbi's back. Jakolbi's mother, Patricia Lard, told me that rather than being heartbroken, he was the heart-breaker. She brought Jakolbi's daughter, Jamyah, to an exhibition that included Jakolbi's portrait in 2023. She believes that exhibiting Jakolbi's portrait honors his life. Ms. Lard thanked me for \"... seeing in her Sun (sic) what the world did not.\" Has working in schools changed how you think about education or childhood? The students have a lot more agency than kids in my generation or even my daughter's generation did. These students are free to define themselves through their chosen teams and clubs, their dress, sexual orientation, pronouns and sometimes taking on a new name. There's a freedom in the acceptance and allowance for difference I see and a closeness in the physical camaraderie between many of the students. I started reading the news more closely when I began this project. CPS (Chicago Public Schools) and the CTU (the Chicago Teachers Union) are frequently in the headlines. It's clear that Chicago's past is linked to its present by a history of events affecting the city in housing, education, racial and gender equity and immigration. All of these issues flow through the permeable wall between the city and the public schools. What do you hope viewers take away from seeing these images? I hope these pictures encourage a deeper consideration and appreciation of the radiant young people in our public schools that goes far beyond the stereotypes. I intend these portraits to honor and commemorate those who are vulnerable and often underrepresented. Melissa Ann Pinney is an artist based in Chicago.

the planet — and make humans happier? \n         By Brian Mann \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. On a late autumn day, John Davis hiked through what looks like wild forest in New York's Champlain Valley, surrounded by flaming red maple trees and yellow birch. A bird flushed noisily through the undergrowth. \"Look there, a ruffed grouse,\" he said, his delight obvious.     This place is an example of what Davis calls \"rewilding,\" which means the footprint of human activity has begun to fade.   \"It simply means stepping back and letting nature unfold as it will,\" he said. \"Some of this was farmed as recently as the 1990s. Probably used for sheep pasture and certainly for logging. You're seeing old stone walls.\" Populations in many countries are beginning to age rapidly and gradually decline, in large part due to individuals choosing to have fewer children.   It's a trend that alarms many experts, and politicians, who say the fabric of whole communities could unravel, but many activists, researchers and economists also see big upsides. This part of New York state, Essex County, has  lost about 6% of its population  since 2010 due to out-migration and the declining birthrate.     Davis, who works for an organization called the Rewilding Institute, says the pivot toward fewer people is allowing landscapes like this one to heal. \"I have a perhaps unpopular view on human population, I believe we are too many and we consume too much,\" he said. \"We need to encourage a small family ethic, especially among affluent people.\" Upsides: More choice and a huge decline in teen pregnancy The global population has doubled to more than 8 billion since the 1970s. Davis thinks that growth turbocharged consumerism and accelerated climate change and the loss of wildlife habitat.  \"I love kids, we all love kids,\" Davis said. \"But if we could encourage small families, we'd have a better chance addressing not just the extinction [of species] and climate crisis, but also problems of poverty and inequity.\"  That hope is being tested, as the \"small family ethic\" championed by Davis and other activists arrives in much of the world.   Since the 1970s, researchers say family size dropped by more than half, from about five children per woman on average to roughly two,  according to the latest United Nations data .   Actual population decline has already begun in about half the G7 industrialized countries that make up much of the world's economic activity.   Every one of those countries, including the U.S. has  fallen below the so-called \"replacement rate\"  of births needed to maintain a stable population over the long term.   Without  large-scale immigration, the U.S.  will join the list of countries losing population in the coming decades. Experts say the trend is driven in large part by women choosing to delay having children, having fewer kids, and in many cases, deciding not become mothers at all. \"I just really wanted to do other things with my life,\" said Marian Starkey, who told NPR she and her husband opted not to have children.   \"Most of my friends here don't have children.  People have made the decision they also want to do other things with their lives than raise children.\"  Starkey works with a group called Population Connection that advocates in favor of policies that support this shift toward smaller families and gradual depopulation.   According to Starkey, fewer people will mean a healthier environment, but she also thinks the trend is good news for humans.   \"The smaller families are, the more time and wealth there is to invest in each child, making sure all of your kids get an education, which does not happen in all parts of the world, especially for girls,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many experts are voicing deep concerns about this population shift. They say it's not clear how economies and family structures that have relied for decades on steady growth will function as communities age and begin to decline.   \"I think this has huge implications for which we're not prepared as a society,\" said Martina Yopo-Díaz, a sociologist at the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile, who studies population loss,  in a July interview with NPR . \"Key social systems, from the economy to the labor market to pensions, are based on the principle that there will be new generations to replace the old ones. But now we see that that principle is no longer something that we can, you know, take as given.\" But NPR also found experts who who view this as a hopeful moment, part of a decades-long trend with benefits for the environment, families and women. Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard University, said fears about declining population are overblown. She says there's evidence people are happier when free to decide for themselves if and when to have kids.   \"To have the number of children they want to have, and to have them at the right time in their lives, is certainly a benefit to couples,\" she said.   None of the advocates for lower population interviewed by NPR favor efforts that force people to have fewer kids, like China's infamous \"One Child\" policy, which ended in 2016. Instead they support access to reproductive freedom, family planning information, and contraception. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Goldin and other experts said the biggest single upside to the trend toward smaller families may be improvements in the lives of women and girls.  Research shows delaying motherhood  and having fewer children  often leads to more education, more financial security  and better health.  \"The ability of women to decide how many children to have and when to have them, it's something that is a very positive development in the history of mankind,\" said Vladimíra Kantorová, the lead population scientist at the United Nations.   Kantorová points to the fact that much of the falling birthrate in the U.S. and around the world reflects a plunge in teen and child pregnancy. \"Adolescent child bearing has declined everywhere, so this is something that is really a success story,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Those who see advantages in this population shift generally agree that smaller families and declining birthrates will bring serious policy challenges. Finding workers, maintaining a strong economy and weaving a sense of community could be more difficult in many areas.  One question is how to fund the social safety net and healthcare for rising numbers of elderly, when there are fewer young people. John Davis says he doesn't have answers to all those challenges but he's hopeful people will find ways to navigate this transition.   \"If the smartest young minds in the world were dedicated to figuring how a declining population could support its elders, we would achieve that goal,\" he said. \"I think we'd have a happier world, for people and wildlife.\"  \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   The first time in modern history, the world's human population is expected to level off and then begin to shrink later this century. It is a trend that will pose a huge challenge as communities begin to age. But as part of our series Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing The World, we look today at what might be some of the benefits. NPR's Brian Mann has been speaking to thinkers and activists who welcome a planet with fewer people. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: On a late autumn day, John Davis treks through what looks like wild forest in New York's Champlain Valley - flaming red maple trees, yellow birch. Not so long ago, Davis says there were people here working this land. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) JOHN DAVIS: Some of this was farmed as recently as, I believe, the 1990s. We're seeing old stone walls. It was probably used for sheep pasture some and certainly for logging. MANN: This place is an example of what Davis calls rewilding. DAVIS: Simply means stepping back and letting nature unfold as it will. MANN: This part of New York state, Essex County, has lost about 6% of its population since 2010 because of migration and the low birth rate. It's a trend happening in a growing number of regions in more and more countries. This kind of slow depopulation worries many economists and business leaders. But Davis, an environmental activist who works for an organization called the Rewilding Institute, thinks it's overdue. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) DAVIS: I have a perhaps unpopular view on human population. I believe that we are too many and that we consume too much. We need to encourage a small family ethic, especially among affluent people. MANN: The global population has doubled to more than 8 billion since the 1970s. Davis thinks that growth turbocharged everything from climate change to the loss of wildlife. Here's the fascinating thing. That small family ethic he mentioned, it's already here. Over roughly that same period, beginning in the 1960s, researchers say family size worldwide dropped by more than half, from about five children per woman, on average, to roughly two. In most countries, outside sub-Saharan Africa, population growth has slowed almost to zero, and in many areas, population decline is a reality. Marian Starkey's family is helping shape that trend. MARIAN STARKEY: I just really wanted to do other things with my life. MANN: Starkey says she and her husband decided not to have kids. She works with a group called Population Connection that advocates in favor of this shift towards smaller families and gradual depopulation. Fewer people means a healthier environment, Starkey says. But she also thinks it's good for humans. STARKEY: The smaller families are, the more time and wealth there is to invest in each child, so making sure that all of your kids get an education, which does not happen in a lot of parts of the world, especially for girls. MANN: Now, again, NPR has spoken to a lot of experts deeply concerned about this population shift. They say it's not clear how economies and family structures that have long relied on growth will function as communities age and begin to decline. But we also wanted to hear from people convinced this is a hopeful moment. Claudia Goldin is an economist at Harvard who thinks fears about declining population are overblown. She says there's evidence people are happier making their own choices - when and if to have kids. CLAUDIA GOLDIN: To have the number of children that they would like to have and to have them at the right time in their lives is certainly a benefit to couples. MANN: It's important to say none of the advocates for lower population interviewed by NPR want policies that force people to have fewer kids. Instead, they support access to reproductive freedom and contraception. Goldin and other experts say the biggest single upside to this trend towards smaller families may be improvements in the lives of women and girls. Research shows delaying motherhood and having fewer children can lead to more education, more financial security and better health. Vladimira Kantorova is the lead population scientist at the United Nations. VLADIMIRA KANTOROVA: It's something which is a very positive development in the history of mankind. MANN: Kantorova says much of the falling birth rate in the U.S. and around the world reflects one more positive, a plunge in teen and child pregnancy. KANTOROVA: So this is something which is really a success story. MANN: Even those who see big upsides in this population shift agree smaller families and declining birth rates will mean turbulence and policy challenges. Finding workers, maintaining a strong economy and weaving a sense of community could be more difficult. One big question is how to fund the social safety net and health care for rising numbers of elderly when there are fewer young people. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) MANN: John Davis says he doesn't have answers to all those challenges, but he's hopeful people will find ways to navigate this transition. DAVIS: If the smartest young minds in the world were dedicated toward figuring out how a declining population can support its elders, we would achieve that goal. I think we'd have a happier world for people and wildlife. MANN: Most experts agree smaller families are here to stay. People who cheerlead lower population say it's time to lean into that change, planning and working to make sure the benefits outweigh the costs. Brian Mann, NPR News.

Climate change is affecting our food, and our food is affecting the climate. NPR is dedicating a week to  stories and conversations about the search for solutions . Each week, people in the U.S. eat the equivalent of  three burgers' worth  of beef. That's according to Richard Waite, a senior research associate in the food program at the World Resources Institute. But if Americans could reduce that consumption by half, it could have a major impact on creating a more sustainable food system, according to projections from WRI. That's because meat production is hard on the environment: It requires a lot of land to raise cattle  — and globally, many forests are being cleared to make room for those animals. Deforestation releases lots of heat-trapping carbon dioxide that had been stored in the trees into the environment. And cows themselves release a lot of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas,  in the form of burps. If people in the U.S. and other heavy meat-eating countries could  cut back their beef consumption  down to just 1.5 burgers a week, \"it would actually make it possible to feed 10 billion people by 2050 without any further deforestation,\" says Waite. How to cut back on meat To curb your diet's environmental impact and fight climate change, you  could  go vegetarian or vegan — but you don't have to. It turns out, cutting back a little can have a big impact. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Experts like Waite recommend eating less of the most resource-intensive meats: goat, lamb and especially beef — the most commonly consumed of these meats. Cows \"take the most land to grow and feed,\" he says. If you're a meat lover, these tips and recipes can help you dial back your meat intake — and explore new flavors you might really enjoy: Don't start from scratch  \"I always tell people to start by adding to the familiar foods that they're already making,\"  says  Tracye McQuirter , a public health nutritionist and author. Having stir-fry? Swap in plant-based proteins for meat — try adding tofu, cashews, almonds, mushrooms or edamame.  Consider frozen and bulk foods  If you're shopping on a budget, McQuirter suggests cutting costs by buying beans and nuts in bulk and shopping for frozen vegetables, which she says are \"just as nutritious\" as fresh.   Spices are your friend  Spices and seasonings can go a long way in bringing the flavors you love into your food. \"If you love Thai, if you love Ethiopian, if you love Caribbean [food]— keep those spices on hand as well,\" she says.  Eat the rainbow  Try to have at least three colors on your plate at a time. \"They each reflect specific nutrients and antioxidants — cancer-fighting agents — in your food,\" says McQuirter. \"The way that you really know that you're getting the nutrients that you need on a plant-based diet is just by having variety. So don't focus on the day, focus on the week, and just have a variety of grains and beans and fruits and vegetables.\" Looking for inspiration for your next meatless Monday? McQuirter shared two vegan recipes to help you kick off a diet lighter in meat, but still rich in flavor.    Vegetable Pot Pie Ingredients:  2 tablespoons water or extra-virgin olive oil 1 yellow onion, diced 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped ½ cup finely chopped mushrooms 1/2 (13.5-ounce) can light or regular coconut milk (or more, if desired)  1 tablespoon whole wheat or oat flour 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast 2 teaspoons sea salt 1 teaspoon thyme ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 cups frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, corn, peas, and green beans)  1 (13.5-ounce) can or carton of chickpeas, drained 2 (9-inch) frozen prepared whole-grain pie crusts, thawed Freshly ground black pepper, to taste Directions:  Preheat oven to 375°F. In a large soup pot, heat the water or oil over medium heat. Stir in the onions and garlic, and sauté until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and sauté for another 3 minutes. Add the milk, flour, nutritional yeast, salt, thyme, and cayenne, and mix until thoroughly combined. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring often. Place the vegetable mixture in a large bowl and stir in frozen vegetables and chickpeas. Stir in black pepper, taste, and adjust seasonings, as desired.  Spoon the filling into the bottom pie crust. Cover the filling with the top pie crust, cut away the excess crust, and crimp the edges of the crusts together to seal. Make three small slits in the top center. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until crust turns golden brown. Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving. The pot pie can be stored in the freezer in an airtight container for up to 3 months.  Makes 6-8 servings.  Savory Vegetable Quiche Ingredients:  Crust: 1 (9-inch) whole grain piecrust  Filling:  1 block firm tofu, drained and pressed (see directions)  3 tablespoons nutritional yeast  2 teaspoons oregano  1/2 teaspoon sea salt  Vegetables: 2 tablespoons olive oil  2 small leeks or 1 large leek, thinly sliced, white part only (about 1 cup)  3 garlic cloves, finely chopped  4 medium zucchinis or 2 large zucchinis, thinly sliced, about 1/8-inch thick  1 teaspoon sea salt  Cayenne pepper, to taste  Freshly ground black pepper, to taste  2 cups baby spinach  1/2 cup basil leaves, loosely packed  Directions:  Crust: Preheat oven to 375°F. Thaw piecrust for 10 minutes. Place the crust in the oven for 10 minutes and then set aside.  Filling: Squeeze the excess water out of the tofu by pressing it in a towel. Place the tofu, nutritional yeast, oregano, and salt in a food processor and process until smooth.  Vegetables: In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Stir in the leeks and garlic, and sauté until the leeks are translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring often. Add zucchini, salt, and cayenne, stirring often until the zucchini is tender, about 5 minutes, and then remove from heat. Place zucchini mixture in a large bowl and stir in the spinach, basil, and tofu mixture. Taste and adjust seasoning, as desired. Spoon the filling into the piecrust, smooth out with the back of a spoon. Bake until firm, about 35 minutes, then let sit for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 6-8 servings.  The podcast version of this episode was produced by  Clare Marie Schneider.   We'd love to hear from you. Leave us a voicemail at 202-216-9823 or email us at  LifeKit@npr.org .

In this episode, how to eat less meat so you can help the environment and your diet. If that feels like a big ask, you can actually start pretty small. We're going to start with a yes or no question. Do you need to cut out all the meat in your diet to make an environmental impact? RICHARD WAITE: No, you don't. GODOY: That's Rich Waite. He's a senior research associate in the food program at the World Resources Institute. He's going to walk us through the environmental impact of meat production and consumption. And seriously, you don't have to become vegan or vegetarian to make an impact. Even Rich, who knows all the research, says he still eats meat. WAITE: I am an omnivore. I eat pretty much everything. GODOY: But when thinking about meat consumption, Rich says, we want to cut back on the most resource-intensive meats. Those are the animals that take the most land to grow and feed, which means beef and lamb. So while we're not telling you to cut out meat altogether, we are going to help you rethink your relationship to meat. Think abundance, not lack. TRACYE MCQUIRTER: And so I always tell people to think about what you're gaining. GODOY: That's Tracye McQuirter, public health nutritionist and author. So once Rich gives us all the environmental facts, Tracye is going to help us actually put all that information into action with tips for eating a more plant-based diet. MCQUIRTER: That's really a mindset shift, I think, for people to think about, you know, what they're gaining rather than what they're missing out on. GODOY: And if you're feeling discouraged or unsure if your personal consumption can really make an impact, remember this. WAITE: Well, it all adds up 'cause there's, you know, almost 8 billion people on the planet today, and there's going to probably be about 10 billion of us on the planet by 2050. GODOY: So you can do your part. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GODOY: When we talk about the environmental impact of meat production, why is it that it does have such a big environmental footprint? How much is beef production a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions? WAITE: Well, the food system as a whole, when you're looking at agriculture and deforestation, contributes about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, and animal agriculture contributes about 14.5%. And within that, beef production is about 40% of those animal agricultural emissions, so it's about 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions. GODOY: Just beef - we're just talking about cattle, right? WAITE: Correct. GODOY: And why is it that producing meat has such a big footprint on the environment? WAITE: So beef production causes greenhouse gas emissions in a few ways. Cows and other ruminant animals emit methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas, as they digest grasses and plants. GODOY: These are the cow burps. WAITE: That's right. These are the cow burps - technically called enteric fermentation, which the cow burps. And there's also methane that gets emitted from manure and also nitrous oxide, which is another powerful greenhouse gas. And then also, rising beef production and consumption also requires increasing quantities of land, and so as the global population grows and people consume more meat, more trees are cut down for pasture, land and for growing crops. And that releases carbon dioxide, which is stored in the forests. GODOY: OK, so it's both the cows themselves burping out methane and also the land needed to raise them being deforested, which adds to greenhouse gas emissions. WAITE: Correct. GODOY: Got it. But when we talk about changing our diet to have an impact on this, you know, the question is, can little old me personally cutting back on meat make a dent in this problem? I mean, can my diet choices really make a difference? WAITE: If you think about here in the U.S., we eat a relatively high amount of meat per person, and the average U.S. diet takes about two acres to grow all of the food that we eat per person. And about half of that is from beef production, and about - more than 80% of it is for all meat and dairy combined. So if you think about it, shifting to a diet that is - you know, has less meat and has more plants in it will reduce the amount of land that it takes to grow your diet. And if you add that up across millions or billions of people, it makes it easier to feed a growing population without knocking down more forests. GODOY: How much would we have to cut out beef 'cause you said that beef is the prime offender, right? WAITE: So just to give you a, you know, sense of this, we looked at some different scenarios, and we found that, for example, if people in the U.S. cut back their beef consumption by about half - so we eat about three burgers - burger equivalents - per person per week, and we looked at a scenario in which people cut back to about 1 1/2 burgers per person per week. If we did that here, it would actually make it possible to feed 10 billion people by 2050 without any further deforestation - again, because it reduces the amount of land that it takes to feed each person. GODOY: So if you are cutting back on red meat, what are the best options for replacements from an environmental perspective? Let's say, is chicken just as good as fish, for instance? RICH WAITE: As it goes, chicken and fish are both on the lower end of resource intensity in terms of animal protein production. You can be pretty flexible about it. GODOY: I've had friends over the years who've gone vegetarian, and a lot of them tended to replace meat with dairy products. Does that approach actually help or, you know, do you really want to be replacing meat with plants? WAITE: Well, that's interesting that you mention that because we found that as well. And so when we were modeling impacts of different diets, that's one of the things that came out, is if you look at what vegetarians actually eat, they tend to replace a certain amount of the meat that they're no longer eating with dairy products or with eggs. And, you know, again, dairy products are going to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than, you know, plant-based foods. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WAITE: So if you do switch completely towards plants, you will have a greater impact, but we looked at the impact of the average U.S. diet versus a vegetarian version of the U.S. diet that includes some dairy and eggs. And the vegetarian diet took about half the amount of land and about half the greenhouse gas emissions as an average American diet. GODOY: Got it. So you don't have to give up your dairy if you want to (laughter) - if you want to make an impact. WAITE: That's right. And you don't - and again, you don't even have to give up beef. It's just about kind of shifting the proportion, the mix of what you're doing. GODOY: OK, good to know because I still like cheeseburgers. I'm sorry. (LAUGHTER) GODOY: When we are talking about beef specifically, are there certain techniques for raising the cattle that make it better for the environment than other techniques? Or, you know, is grass-fed beef better, for instance? WAITE: So on grass-fed beef, it's actually tricky because finishing cattle on grass instead of finishing them on grain in feedlots, it leads to slower animal growth and the cattle tend to be slaughtered at a lower weight. And what then happens is that land use and greenhouse gas emissions per pound of grass-finished beef actually tend to be higher than that of conventional grain-finished beef. Right now, it's still easier to shift what you're eating towards plants and also minimize your food waste as kind of surefire ways to reduce your diet's footprint. And, you know, hopefully one day, we'll be able to walk into the grocery store and see a bunch of carbon labeling in the beef section. You can pick out the most climate friendly cuts of meat, but we're not there yet. GODOY: And what about buying local meat? Does that make an environmental impact? WAITE: So I think, you know, a lot of people have an intuition that food miles are sort of a really important component of the climate impact associated with the food that we eat. And actually, especially when you're talking about meat, emissions from transport is actually very small, and it's a lot smaller than the emissions from producing the food. So there was a study that was done a few years ago that estimated that production - it was, like, 83% of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the U.S. diet and transportation was only 11%. So, you know, eating local meat, it's going to be a less effective climate strategy than eating less meat and more plants. GODOY: It can seem overwhelming when you're trying to cut back on meat. I'm wondering, are there examples in the past where we've actually overhauled our whole diet as a society? That's a big thing. And we're a big meat-eating country, right? WAITE: Yeah, well, it's interesting. If you actually look back at the eating patterns in the U.S. back to the 1970s, we've actually already cut back on per-person beef consumption by about one-third. And Americans still eat about the same amount of meat overall as they did in the 1970s, but they shifted from beef toward chicken. And the interesting thing about that, too, is if you look back to the 1970s, overall beef production in the U.S. has held pretty steady because we've added another 120 million Americans to the population. If you're thinking about, you know, the global challenge, we're looking at something similar, right? We're going to be adding another two billion people to the human family. You know, under business as usual, we could be looking at a lot more deforestation to, you know, clear the land to feed everybody. And if we think about the kinds of changes that we can make to eat a diet that has a lower footprint, we can - you know, we can sustainably feed more people. GODOY: So we've done it before, basically (laughter). WAITE: Exactly. Not unprecedented. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GODOY: That's Rich Waite of the World Resources Institute. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GODOY: Eating less red meat and more plants isn't just good for the environment. It's good for your health, too. MCQUIRTER: It's really important to know that the food that you eat is the most important in determining your quality of life right now and your quality of life in the future. GODOY: That's Tracye McQuirter, public health nutritionist and author, and she knows that diet matters. MCQUIRTER: We know that eating more whole grains, more fresh fruits and vegetables and more plant-based proteins are the healthiest foods we can eat because they don't come with cholesterol and zero or very little saturated fat, which can clog your arteries and lead to cardiovascular disease. And heart disease is the No. 1 killer in the country. So we want to eat more plant-based foods or all plant-based foods. But definitely start out, wherever you are, by adding more plant-based foods to your plate and less meat. GODOY: Right. And just so listeners know, we've actually included some of Tracye's plant-based recipes online at /lifekit. So, Tracye, what are some impactful but smaller changes you can make to your diet if you want to start eating less meat? MCQUIRTER: Well, I like to start by suggesting that people add, and so that means adding more plant-based proteins to your plate. So, for example, if you're making a stir-fry for dinner and you have colorful vegetables, you're having that over brown rice, for example, you can add in tofu. You can add in cashews. You can add in almonds. You can add in pecans as your protein. You can add in edamame as your protein instead of meat and still have a really delicious, healthy dish. And so I always tell people to start by adding to the familiar foods that they're already making. GODOY: So one concern that's often raised, though, about eating more produce is price. Good produce can be expensive. How can we make this change of adding more fruits and vegetables into our life and cutting back on meat without breaking the bank? MCQUIRTER: It's really, really not hard to eat healthy on a budget if you are eating whole foods. So, for example, getting beans or nuts from the bulk bin - they're much cheaper per pound than it would be to have that same dish, but you have to buy meat to put in it. You can buy frozen food, and frozen vegetables are just as nutritious. They're actually usually flash frozen, so the nutrients remain intact. So you can have frozen vegetables just as easily, and you can keep them in the freezer for months. GODOY: What are some practical tips for cutting out meat in terms of meal prep or, you know, just things we should stock in our pantry? MCQUIRTER: So I would definitely suggest stocking up on beans and add them to any dish that you're having. You can have them in tacos. You can have them in a wrap. You can have them on a salad. You can have them in a stir-fry. You can have them in a soup or a chili. So just think about beans in a different color. So if you're going to your supermarket, just kind of look in the bulk bin and just choose some colorful beans and always have those on hand. Try to have at least three colors on your plate, and, you know, don't be afraid to have more than one vegetable at a time to add to those colors. GODOY: It takes a little planning to soak those dried beans, but you can also buy canned ones. Either way, it's actually a great source of protein and a staple at my house. But let's dig into that whole idea of colors. Why is it important to eat the rainbow when we're talking about fruits and vegetables? MCQUIRTER: They each reflect specific nutrients and antioxidants, cancer-fighting agents in your food. So that's why you want to focus on the color, because it means more nutrients. Also, you want to have whole grains on hand. They're high in protein and also many, many other nutrients that are good for you - iron, calcium, potassium, magnesium. The way that you really know that you're getting the nutrients that you need on a plant-based diet is just by having variety. So don't focus on the day. Focus on the week, and just have a variety of grains and beans and fruits and vegetables and also just seasonings - your favorite seasoning. Seasonings are important for whatever type of foods that you're eating, whatever type of diet that you have, right? If you love Thai, if you love Ethiopian, if you love Caribbean, keep those spices on hand as well. GODOY: What's the biggest challenge most people face when they're trying to cut down on the meat in their diet? MCQUIRTER: I think the biggest challenge is thinking about, you know, like a plate. What is going to replace, you know, that meat? So think about making simple meals that you already are making and you're just swapping out the protein. You're swapping out an animal-based protein for a meat-based protein. So if you're making a pasta, if you're making a soup, even if you're making a fajita, a burrito, a wrap, you can use beans and nuts and tofu, edamame, mushrooms. So there's so many wonderful options. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GODOY: That's author and nutritionist Tracye McQuirter. OK, let's recap. You don't have to cut out all the meat in your diet to make an environmental impact. From an environmental standpoint, not all meat is equal. Beef and lamb are the most resource-intensive meats, so if you're eating for the planet, try to cut back on those. You know, instead of a burger, sub in fish or eggplant. Think about what you can add to your plate rather than what you're taking off. Tracye recommends substituting meat with other sources of protein like beans, tofu and nuts. We've included some of her plant-based recipes online at /lifekit.

    By Ashley Lopez \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         LOS ANGELES — Adelaide Stone Van Gessel says she doesn't agree with partisan gerrymandering in practice. But she voted yes on Proposition 50, a California  ballot measure  that would allow the state's Democratic leaders to temporarily bypass California's independent redistricting commission and enact a more Democratic-friendly congressional map ahead of next year's midterm elections. Van Gessel and others who back Prop 50 told NPR the proposal provides the Democratic-leaning state a rare opportunity to directly counteract President Trump and Republican efforts to redraw political maps in their favor in other states. \"What we're doing is gerrymandering to stop gerrymandering,\" she said. \"And that's not really the best solution, but it is something that we find ourselves in this kind of environment having to do.\" Voting for the one-issue special election concludes Tuesday, with polling showing that  Prop 50 is likely to pass . If it does, California's Democratic state leaders can use a new congressional map that makes five U.S. House seats more favorable to the party, offsetting the five districts Republicans  shifted their direction in Texas  earlier this year. GOP lawmakers in  Missouri  and  North Carolina  have also enacted new maps, and  a bipartisan deal reached last week in Ohio  tilts that state's congressional map further to the right. Lawmakers in other states, including Virginia Democrats, could join the redistricting fight. In Southern California, many left-leaning voters approving Prop 50 reported having mixed feelings about the measure, but ultimately felt that allowing a partisan gerrymander is one of the only options they have to stop Trump from shutting out a Democratic win in Congress next year. \"We can't play the game like decent people anymore,\" said Stephanie Eberstein, who, like Van Gessel, lives in the liberal LA neighborhood of Venice. \"I mean, those rules are out the window. So, we have to do what we have to do.\" In Orange County, Eva Hernandez agrees. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We got to do something,\" Hernandez said. \"Can't just sit back and let things roll like they've been rolling. … California's got to do it. We're a blue state. We got to do what we got to do to counteract that.\" Republican voters in California fear losing representation With surveys showing Prop 50 likely to be approved, it appears none of the opposition's arguments against the measure is truly landing in a state that is strongly Democratic. A number of voters told NPR they're focused on the current proposal, and could not recall how they voted about 15 years ago, when the state's citizen-led, nonpartisan redistricting commission was enacted. Kathy Brewer voted no on Prop 50. She lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, one of a few GOP-leaning enclaves in Southern California. She told NPR she thinks this special election and redraw are unnecessary. \"It's a waste of money,\" she said. \"Of good California money that we need.\" Betty Roth is another no vote. She says that as a Republican she already feels pretty powerless in the state. Out of the 52 seats California has in the U.S. House, only nine are currently held by Republicans. Roth says she doesn't want the GOP to lose what little representation it has. \"They're trying to take away the vote from a good portion of the American people by, you know, gerrymandering,\" she said. But a lot of Democratic voters don't feel much sympathy for this argument. Aaron Leal, who also lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, says Republicans are trying to rig the midterms in their favor because they aren't sure they can win on policy. He says the party is practically forcing Democrats to react. \"If one side is going full force pushing their agenda, we cannot bring, as they say, like a knife to a gunfight,\" he said. Leal says he also likes that the measure is temporary. After 2030, the state would go back to the independent redistricting commission. \"Somebody has to do something\" Polling shows the Democratic base has been largely frustrated with their leaders — mostly because they haven't been able to do much. \"The Democrats haven't really fought back and done anything to combat what's going on with the Republican Party and Trump,\" said David Checel in Culver City. \"So, yeah. I don't know what you're supposed to do on this, and I'm glad I'm not a politician.\" Checel wasn't thrilled about Prop 50 but voted in favor of it because it's better than doing nothing, he said. Other Democrats say they are really excited to see their leaders fight back, including Reina Santiago in Venice. \"I'm glad that our state is taking the charge against this because somebody has to do something,\" she said. \"The GOP is totally complicit with Trump, and if we let them walk all over us, they'll do it. So that's what this vote is about.\" And while Jim Lind, who lives in Irvine, agrees with this sentiment, he said he's also pretty sad that this is what politics has become. \"It's unfortunate that any party, whatever it may be, has to stoop to a lower level to get things done,\" he said. \"You know, all my life I've probably been more idealistic as far as the honesty of people. And it's just not working out.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5597013","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:22:00-05:00","title":"A gun violence 'action plan' calls for a new emphasis on prevention","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new action plan, developed by 60 experts from medicine, public health, criminology, law, and technology, outlines a comprehensive strategy to reduce gun violence in the U.S. by 2040.

emphasis on prevention \n         By Rhitu Chatterjee \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 5:22 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In the past 25 years, the U.S. has seen more than 800,000 deaths from gun violence, and another 2 million or more injuries. A new report offers a roadmap to reduce the human toll of this crisis by 2040. Sixty leading experts from a range of fields, including medicine, public health, criminology, law and the technology sector, convened earlier this year to create an action plan to address the problem. The report was  published in  JAMA  on Monday . \"For too long, I think we've treated this as inevitable,\" says  Dr. Joseph Sakran , a co-author of the study, trauma surgeon and executive vice chair of surgery at Johns Hopkins Medicine. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Gun violence is now the leading cause of death in  children and teens , although the vast majority of firearm deaths are among adults. And nearly 60% of all deaths from firearm injuries are suicides. \"We do have a body of science that can inform and reduce the burden of injuries from firearm violence,\" says  Dr. Sandro Galea , dean of the school of public health at Washington University in St Louis, and study co-author. \"For example, through laws that make sure that there is appropriate screening, that guns do not fall in the hands of people who have a history of violence.\" The authors support alternatives to the typical approach to addressing firearm violence, which has been through the criminal justice system. \"We are not saying we don't need any arrest or any incarceration,\" says study co-author  Daniel Webster , a professor at the  Center for Gun Violence Solutions  at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"That's still necessary for public safety purposes. But you need to invest in programs that prevent violence.\" The roadmap outlined by the study includes taking a community-wide approach to prevention by addressing socioeconomic inequalities. \"Firearm harm is a symptom of deeper structural issues when you think about poverty and segregation and trauma and lack of opportunity,\" says Sakran, who is himself a survivor of gun violence. When he was 17 years old, he was critically injured at a shooting after a high school football game. Studies show that addressing those \"upstream\" factors can prevent gun violence, says Sakran. \"Things like housing stability, having a strong educational system, a pathway for jobs, access to health care, which are as essential to violence prevention as maybe perhaps any other law enforcement strategy,\" he adds. One such community violence intervention in Chicago, called  Create Real Economic Destiny , uses community organizations to identify the individuals most at risk of being involved in violent crime and recruit them to receive supports such as mental health care, mentorship, education and job training. A 2023 study found  that alumni of this program had a 73% lower chance of being involved in a violent crime in the following two years. Webster and his colleagues have found that a similar program in Baltimore, called  Safe Streets , led to a 32% reduction in homicides and a 23% reduction in non-fatal shootings. State gun laws also make a difference, says Webster. For example,  a recent study in  JAMA Pediatrics   showed that states with more restrictive gun laws have fewer pediatric deaths from firearms. Webster and his colleagues have shown that firearm licensing laws \"can reduce firearm homicide roughly 30% or possibly more. \"And similar effects on reducing firearm suicide,\" he says. Overall, the report calls for a multi-pronged approach to prevention. \"In America, the burden [of addressing gun violence] has often been placed on the shoulders of a few people,\" says Sakran. \"What this report is talking about is the collective action that is so critical in order to move the needle forward.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1188769974","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Ongoing Conflict Between Israel and Hamas in Gaza Escalates, Humanitarian Crisis Deepens","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has intensified, with Israel conducting airstrikes and ground operations, resulting in widespread destruction and significant civilian casualties.

My favorite stories were filled with magic, adventure and possibility, like  Around the World in 80 Days . And I had all the time in the world to search for those tales at the library and school book fairs. As an adult, though, I get into reading ruts. I don't have as much time to dig around for books, and I'm not as sure of what I'll be into. Traci Thomas  loves recommending books to people like me who can't decide on what to read. She's the creator and host of the podcast  The Stacks , where she talks to guests about new titles (she recently interviewed former Georgia state representative Stacey Abrams about  her new romance novel ) and offers quirky book lists such as  short audiobooks to help you hit your reading goals  and  great books to re-read with your toddler . Thomas is confident that with a bit of soul-searching and a bit of luck, you  will  discover a book you'll enjoy and want to finish. \"There are so many books in the world, and there are books out there for you. Trust your gut,\" she says. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Interview highlights Go ahead, judge the book by its cover I am the queen of \"judge a book by its cover.\" The reason you can [do that] is because there is a lot of effort and marketing that goes into making covers that tell you what's in the book, what kind of person it's for and what to expect.  When you start to look at the books that you've loved in your life, you might notice some trends. When I look at my bookshelves, I have the most black books and the most red books, but I don't have a lot of green books. Whatever they're doing with the marketing for green books — not for me. I don't know if you should use a cover to pick a book 100% [of the time]. I have read books with gorgeous covers that I did not like. I have also read books that had embarrassing covers that I loved. But if you're at a bookstore and are trying to decide which of the three or four books to buy, pick what speaks to you and jumps out at you.  Just because Oprah liked it doesn't mean you will   People get into reading ruts because they try to read whatever they saw in  The New York Times  or Oprah's Book Club, even though it's not anything that they would normally want to read.  I encourage folks to trust what you like over trying to read with Oprah Winfrey because she's picking the books that  she  likes. Unless you have the exact same taste as Oprah, you might not agree that the book is great — and it might be difficult for you to get through it. Ditch the book if you find yourself scrolling through Instagram  You know if you don't like something. If you're falling asleep, checking your phone or rolling your eyes as you're reading the sentences, that might be a good sign that you don't like what you're reading.  So put the book down. Save yourself. There are too many books in the world to read. That is called \"cultivating taste.\" Zero in on what you like  You know what you're drawn to. Like, I know I want to see the \"Barbie\" movie. So what are some books [that take place during the time era when you might have been playing with Barbie]? What are some books that have hot pink covers?  Articulate what it is that you're looking for. Are you looking for something with a lot of plot? Something romantic? Something nonfiction about public schools? Do you want to read a novel? A play? A collection of poetry? Zero in on what you like. Pay attention to what's on display at your local bookstore Bookstores get to decide what they stock, so they're going to stock things they think will sell or will be interesting to their community.  [For that reason], I like to look and see what's on the tables at the front of the bookstore or what's facing out on the shelves, because there is usually something that's new and exciting to either the world at large or to the booksellers in that specific store.  Seek the wise counsel of a book 'magician'  Booksellers and librarians are book matchmakers and magicians. You can go into a bookstore or library and say, \"I'm in the mood for something that feels like a long drive on Christmas Eve.\" And they'll be like, \"Oh, here you go.\" They always come up with something.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. When I was a kid, I was a beast when it came to reading. I was gulping down books by the dozen. I think that's in part because of that BOOK IT! program where you'd get a free personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut when you read a certain number of books. But also, reading transported me to this other world filled with magic and adventure and possibility. Plus, I had a lot of free time. As an adult, I have lost some of that magic. I get into these reading ruts because my time is limited, and nobody's offering pizza. And also, I'm not sure what books I'll even like. TRACI THOMAS: OK, what kind of TV shows do you like? That's where I start. SEGARRA: That's Traci Thomas, reporting for duty. She's a creator and host of \"The Stacks,\" a podcast about books. And Traci is really good at recommending books based on questions like this. I told her I just watched a movie on Netflix called \"Uncharted\" with Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg. And they are in search of, you know, buried treasure from long ago. And there are other people who are trying to get to it first. It's a big, big adventure. THOMAS: OK. Would you want a story that's set in the past, or would you want a story that is set in the present or in the future? SEGARRA: What I liked about this was that it was set in the present, but they were looking for something from the past. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: She also asked how I want to feel when I'm reading - happy or maybe tense but only in a, you know, got to solve the mystery kind of way. I also told her that one of my favorite books as a kid was \"Around The World In Eighty Days\" by Jules Verne, another adventure tale. With that info, she came up with two intriguing book suggestions, which I will share at the end of this episode. But yeah, if you're looking for something to read, Traci's got so many tips for you. On this episode of LIFE KIT - how to find books that you will love. We talk about what questions to ask yourself, how to decide on a genre or category and whether you can, in fact, judge a book by its cover. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: What are you reading right now? THOMAS: Oh, that's a great question. So I am currently reading a book called \"Momfluenced.\" I'm doing that on audiobook. And then with my eyes, I am reading a book called \"The Death Of Public School\" by Cara Fitzpatrick. SEGARRA: Both of them sound like maybe nonfiction? THOMAS: Both of them are definitely nonfiction. I am a nonfiction girlie. SEGARRA: What do you love so much about nonfiction? THOMAS: I'm a skeptic. And so sometimes when I read fiction, I'm like, that would never happen in real life, and it takes me out of it. I have a hard time, like, suspending my disbelief. But when I read nonfiction, I'm like, this is real life. And I like to learn. And also, the writing style of nonfiction is often a little more straightforward. I think sometimes with fiction, you know, authors write with sort of flowery language, which I know lots of people love, but for me, it just can be distracting. SEGARRA: Totally. I want to know if you are someone, especially if you're someone who hasn't been reading that much lately or in - you're in a kind of a reading rut, how can you start to figure out what you actually want to read? THOMAS: I think you know, right? Don't you know? Like, for a movie, like, I know I want to see the \"Barbie\" movie. SEGARRA: Me too. THOMAS: I'm not sure if I'll like it or not, but I know, at least, that I want to give it a shot. And I just - I think that people feel like they have to finish books. And I think that that is not a helpful approach because I think there are so many books in the world, and there are books out there for you. And I think if you trust your gut a little bit more and you say, OK, I'm really interested in the \"Barbie\" movie, what are some books about the 1980s and 1990s, or what are some books that have hot pink covers - like, you know, like, just the things that you're drawn to. And I think once you find that, it's sort of easier to articulate what it is that you're looking for. Are you looking for something with a lot of plot? Are you looking for something that's romance? Are you looking for something that's nonfiction about public schools? Like, there's so many books once you start to zero in on what it is that you like. SEGARRA: Do you think it might be helpful to go to a bookstore and wander around? THOMAS: Yes. And talk to the booksellers or the librarians. I mean, booksellers and librarians are book matchmakers and sort of magicians. You can go in and say, I read this and this and this, and I loved those three, but I also read this other book that I hated, and I'm in the mood for something that feels like, you know, a long drive on Christmas Eve. And they'll be like, oh, here you go. And they always come up with something. SEGARRA: Yeah. It reminds me of when I go, occasionally, to a cocktail bar and I know exactly how to describe the type of drinks that I like. THOMAS: Yes. SEGARRA: Something either herbal and fresh or smoky, right? And, like, that's something that I have perfected over the years, like, just knowing... THOMAS: Yeah. SEGARRA: ...Getting a lot of the wrong cocktail and being like... THOMAS: Right, right. SEGARRA: ...This tastes medicinal or I'm - this is way too strong or whatever. So I wonder, yeah, are there ways to describe the kinds of book you might like that way? THOMAS: Yes. Yes, you can definitely describe books that way. I think there's sort of three ways to describe books - what it's about, what genre it is, and then also sort of how it makes you feel or what it feels like - you know, 'cause I don't always know what topic I want to read about. I'm usually like, oh, what's some great investigative journalism, or what's a book where someone takes their memoir and ties it into some research? And usually, by kind of coming together with what I'm in the mood for, not necessarily the exact topic, I can get some really great recommendations. SEGARRA: Right. So when you walk into a bookstore, do you have a strategy for how to figure out whether you will like a book that you pick up? THOMAS: I like to look and see what's on the tables in the front because that usually is something that's new and exciting to either the world at large or the booksellers in that specific store. Bookstores get to decide what they stock, so they're going to stock things that they think will sell or that they think are really good or interesting for their community. If the bookstore that I go into has books that face out on the shelves, I like to see which books they've sort of picked to face out. Definitely talk to the booksellers. I ask them what they're reading, what they're excited about, what they've heard good things about. And I'm also just kind of looking around to see what jumps out at me. And then I might read the jacket copy and see a little bit. I don't like to read a lot of the jacket copy because I do not like to know what I'm going into as much as possible. SEGARRA: Right. THOMAS: But if you're feeling like you're in a rut or you want to get into reading, I would recommend reading it a little bit more because you don't want to get a book and then be like, I'm not interested in this. SEGARRA: You mentioned before covers. How much can covers tell you about a book? THOMAS: I think so much. I am the queen of judge a book by its cover. I know I'm not supposed to say that. I have definitely read books that have gorgeous covers that I did not like the book, and I have also read books that had covers that I thought were embarrassing, that - like, embarrassing because they were bad - that I loved the book. So I don't think it's a surefire way. But I think when you start to look at the books that you've loved in your life or that you've read recently that you like, you might notice some trends. Like, for me, when I look at my bookshelves, I have the most black books and the most red books, but I don't have a lot of green books. Like, I think whatever they're doing with the marketing with the green books - not for me. But I think that the reason that you can judge a book by its cover is because there is a lot of effort and marketing that goes into making covers that tell you sort of what's in the book, what kind of person it's for, what to expect. I don't know if you should 100% use a cover to pick a book, but, you know, if you're down to the last three or four and you're like, I don't know which one, which one, you know, sort of speaks to you and jumps out to you? SEGARRA: Yeah. I feel like there are a lot of categories you could consider in books as well. So there's obviously prose, and then there's poetry. There are plays, graphic novels, workbooks. Do you think these are helpful distinctions to start with - like, what kind of book am I looking for? THOMAS: I think so, yes. I think most people have a sense - you know, a broad sense. Like, do I want to read a novel? Do I want to read a play? Do I want to read a collection of poetry? I definitely think if you know for sure you don't like poetry, then no point browsing the poetry section, though I would challenge people to try to read poetry. I am in my trying-to-read-poetry phase and it's a really great, exciting challenge, even though I don't always get it. And I'm told that that's fine, too. So... SEGARRA: It's just such a big category to write it off completely. THOMAS: Totally, totally. I mean, that's - I used to be a I don't read poetry, and then a poet challenged me to read more poetry. So I said, I'm going to read a poem a day for a year. And I did it, and now I read poetry. Poems are a great way to get out of a reading rut, too. SEGARRA: Yeah. So let's say you do want to venture out of what you typically read. We can use the example of nonfiction and fiction. THOMAS: OK. SEGARRA: You're a nonfiction fan. But if you wanted to try to read a fiction book, would you look for something that had, I don't know, similar qualities to some of your favorite nonfiction? THOMAS: Yes. Yes. SEGARRA: Like, how would you think about that? THOMAS: So I know, for me, that I like fiction that is based in reality. I am not super into sci-fi fantasy, so I'm going to stay most likely away from that unless a book comes highly recommended. But we'll pretend like I'm just going in browsing. So I would ask someone or I would look around for a book that is in, like, maybe literary fiction or general fiction. And so - as opposed to genre fiction, which is, like, thriller, mystery, horror, romance. They call that genre fiction, and then general fiction is sort of more realistic, everyday life. This would be where I'd probably read the jacket copy. I would probably read a few sentences to get a sense for what the book is about. And then if I grab a handful, I might go ask the bookseller, like, hey, which of these feels like, you know, real life? Which of these feels sort of like clear narrative? I like plot, so I'd ask, you know, do you know if this book has plot? And I say I like plot because some people really like character development, where not a lot happens in the book, but you sort of sit with a character for hundreds of pages and sort of their thoughts and their musings. So for me personally, I'm a plot person, so I would ask about that. And also, the other thing is if there's no bookseller available to you, if you have your phone on you, you can always Google and just see what the book's about, or maybe see if you can find a review and read a few sentences of that as well. We're in, you know, the information age, so might as well take advantage of that. SEGARRA: There's another element here, too, which is, like, what kind of mood are you going for when you're reading, right? Like, if you're feeling really down, are you one of those people who wants to listen to sad music and lean into it? THOMAS: Right. (Laughter) Right. SEGARRA: Or are you going to put on a happy song and try to change the vibe? It feels like it's about knowing yourself, right? Does it work the same with reading? THOMAS: Yeah, for sure. That's such a good point, because sometimes - and sometimes you want to put on the sad music. And then sometimes you want to put on the happy music. So, like, you really have to figure out what you want. Another piece of advice kind of along those lines is that - I know so many people who get in reading ruts because they try to read whatever they saw in the New York Times or on Oprah's Book Club or whatever, even though it's not anything that they would normally want to read. I encourage folks to trust what you like over trying to read with Oprah Winfrey, because she's picking the books that she likes. SEGARRA: And, I mean, there's also, like - it's OK to like books that other people say are corny... THOMAS: Yes. SEGARRA: ...Or that other people review badly. THOMAS: Yes. SEGARRA: If you love it, that's what matters. THOMAS: Yes, it's art. Books are art, so just like songs. Like, for example - I'm sure I'll get in trouble for saying this, but I do not like Taylor Swift. SEGARRA: (Laughter). THOMAS: I understand that a lot of people do. It's just, it's not for me. It's OK to read something that other people don't like. There's an audience for every single book. You may or may not be that audience, but there are people out there who will like it. So I always try to keep that in mind when I talk about books publicly and when I give people book recommendations. SEGARRA: How do you know, on the flip side, when you're reading that you don't like the book and that you're ready to put it down? Like, how much of a chance do you usually give something? THOMAS: OK, so for my work, I have to read books and finish books that I do not always like. I can tell you, usually, within 10 to 20 pages if I will like a book. And part of that is because I read so much. I think, for most people, though, you know. You know if you don't like something. I think if you're falling asleep while you're reading it, that's a good sign that maybe you don't like it. I think that if you are constantly checking your phone while you're reading that that might be a sign that you don't like it. I think that if you want to do anything else but read, that might be a sign that you don't like what you're reading. I think that if you are rolling your eyes as you're reading the sentences, that might be a good sign that you don't like something. I think it's like everything else. You know what is not for you. SEGARRA: Yeah, and then it is A-OK to put it down. THOMAS: Put it down. Save yourself. There are too many books in the world to read books you do not like. You know what I think? I think that if you are not finishing a book, that is called cultivating taste. (SOUNDBITE OF THOMAS GALLICANI'S \"LOST IN YESTERDAY\") SEGARRA: By the way, if you want to read more and you're having trouble getting into the practice, Traci has tips for that, too. One thing you can do is set an achievable goal, like, I'm going to read 12 books in a year. That worked when she was in a rut. THOMAS: And then I just hit my stride. It made it a practice for me. Now the goal that I have is I read 10 pages a day at minimum. Obviously, some days, I read 300 pages. And some days, I don't quite get to 10. But for me, 10 pages a day felt like, OK, I can commit to this. It's probably 10 to 15 minutes of reading. And if I go beyond, great - and if not, I'm not going to, you know, kick myself in the butt for it. SEGARRA: Finally, back to those book recommendations. Based on everything I said, especially my love of adventure tales, Traci recommended \"Lucky Red.\" THOMAS: I haven't read it yet. But everyone that I respect who has read it, loved it. And it's, like, a queer, lesbian Western. And my friend described it as kiss, kiss, bang bang, which I thought was a fantastic way to describe a book. SEGARRA: She also suggested a book called \"Deep As The Sky, Red As The Sea.\" It's another adventure novel that her friend loved. An online description calls it a historical novel about a legendary Chinese pirate queen, her fight to save her fleet from the forces allied against them and the dangerous price of power.

If you answer 'yes' to these questions, probably not \n         By Marielle Segarra, Malaka Gharib \n        \n           Saturday, July 19, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Many of us know the old adage to save money: Buy what you need, not what you want. But even when money is tight, it's a hard rule to follow. It's OK to buy what you want every now and then, but the key is to be intentional, says  Aja Evans , a licensed mental health counselor and financial therapist. Consider your budget, the occasion and even your mood.  \"What's going on with me emotionally? Am I just buying this because I am upset? Am I buying this because I have this dream that this is gonna solve all my problems?\" she says. To make more mindful purchases, Evans and  Brian Vines , a reporter at Consumer Reports, share questions to ask yourself. If you answer \"yes\" to any of these queries, you may want to reevaluate your purchase. Is your cash flow limited?  If you have to pull funds from what you've set aside for basic needs like housing, groceries, transportation or credit card payments, hold off on spending, Evans says. Don't pull from your emergency fund or the money you've saved for vacations, either. To ensure you've got enough cash for, say, impulse buys at the checkout line, create a line item for fun stuff in your monthly budget, Evans says. Be realistic. \"If you deprive yourself too much, you will not stick to it.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Are you trying to fill an emotional need?  If you find yourself feeling spendy, check in with yourself using the acronym HALT, a tool developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, Evans says. Are you hungry, angry, lonely or tired?  If so, there may be some other way you can fill that need without swiping your card. Eat a piece of chocolate at home, or do something that feels good, like going for a walk in the sun. Is this part of a pattern?  Put your desire to spend into context. Let's say you love hunting for treasures at estate sales. \"If every weekend you're going to different antique stores to search, peel back a layer and ask what's going on,\" Evans says. \"How often are you shopping in this kind of way?\" You may find that you don't actually want to own a new thing. You just love the dopamine rush of discovering a new treasure and making a purchase. That awareness may be enough to put that card back in your wallet. Are you trying to impress someone?  Sometimes we buy the latest and greatest because we think it will bring us status, Evans says. \"Maybe you want people to look at you a certain way, and having this item may signify something [important].\" If this is the case, reflect on why this item matters so much to your self-esteem, and ask yourself why you care so much about what others think. \"That's where the juicy stuff starts to happen,\" she says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Are you going to buy it without doing research?  So you've decided to get a new mattress. Before you hit the \"Buy Now\" button, shop around for the best price and read reviews to make sure you're getting a good product, Vines says. Don't assume that more expensive products are higher quality, he says. \"Price does not guarantee performance.\" At the same time, don't buy something cheap when you can save up for something more expensive that will last. If you're not sure what to get, ask friends and family members for recommendations. \"Call your rich aunt who buys all the things you're interested in having and see if she actually likes it,\" Vines says. \"Call the person you know who is the most cost-conscious and ask them questions.\" Are you feeling so-so about it?  Let's say you have a craving for a doughnut. You head to the bakery to find that it's sold out. Should you get something else? For Vines, the answer is no. \"I'm not going to take a muffin or half a pie or a slice of tiramisu when I want one doughnut,\" he says. \"If it's not what you want, walk away.\" This story was edited by Meghan Keane.

So they add sound effects. And bright flashing lights. And then a blackout. It's honestly pretty convincing. \"The magic of the theater,\" says Tammy Holder, an artist in residence at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts, a theater in Fort Lauderdale. Holder is directing more than three dozen students from middle and high schools across South Florida in an adapted version of a musical that's new for student theater: the 2023 show  Once Upon a One More Time , a jukebox musical featuring the music of Britney Spears. Because this version of the show hasn't been released yet, there's no road map, no other school to copy or learn from, which means the glass slipper scene has to be created from scratch. The original Broadway version of  Once Upon a One More Time  only lasted about three months. But when a show flops — or has a short run in New York — it's not over. Many shows actually get a second, much larger, life when they get licensed for middle and high schools. In fact, four times as many people see live theater in schools, with student actors and performers, than see shows on Broadway. \"The secondary licensing world is so much bigger than Broadway,\" explains John Prignano, the director of education and development for Music Theatre International. The company holds licensing rights for Broadway shows and revamps them into junior versions to sell to schools. \"A show can then live on for years and years.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On Broadway,  The Addams Family  had mixed reviews and closed in 2011 after a year and a half. But schools loved it. By 2019,  it was the most popular high school musical in the country . Holder actually saw the original  Once Upon a One More Time  on Broadway and knew instantly it would make a great junior show for students. It had dancing, catchy pop music and themes about belonging and individuality that she knew would resonate with teenage performers. The story centers on Cinderella (Cindy), who wants to break out of her fairytale story and build her own happily ever after. She's deterred by her evil stepmom and stepsisters but has help from her feminist Fairy Godmother, who encourages her to break her glass slipper (hence that tricky, pivotal scene). There are some discoveries along the way, notably the fact that Prince Charming is the same prince in  everyone's  fairytale. In other words, he's essentially been cheating on Cindy with all of her friends (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, etc.). Cue the hit songs  Oops! ... I Did It Again  and  Womanizer . The size and makeup of the cast helped, too, Holder says: \"The show is like 25 girls and two boys. That's every theater program in the country.\" How to adapt a Broadway play for students Here's how it works: A junior version of a show typically costs a school a flat rate of about $700. In addition to getting the script and the score, schools receive a detailed guide to putting on the show, with directors notes and ideas for costumes, set design and lighting. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Turning a Broadway show into a student production means you have to shrink it down a lot, from more than two hours to about 60 minutes. Songs, scenes and subplots are cut, including those that might be controversial or not age appropriate. Songs with swear words have to go, or get a makeover: Spears' 2013 single  Work Bitch,  for example, gets changed to  Work It , a song the stepsisters sing to Cinderella. But in making all those cuts, the story still has to make sense. That's where the students in Fort Lauderdale come in. They are among a handful of schools and regional theaters that get to work out the bugs and make sure it can be performed successfully on a school stage. \"Talk about a theater kid's dream, getting ahold of something before anyone else can and putting it onstage,\" says Holder, who has worked with Music Theatre International to pilot several student productions. Holder and her students' job is essentially a logistical evaluation of the piece to figure out what stays, what goes and what just doesn't work. Is the length OK? Do the cuts make sense? Can they go from Cinderella's castle to the woods with no scene in between? They're about to find out. What Holder and these students learn and change will influence the final version of the show that will be available to schools across the country next year. Developing a cast of characters Because this version of the show has never been performed before, there is a lot of trial and error and problem-solving in the weeks leading up to opening night. And Holder ends up making a few big changes. The first is that nearly everyone in the cast gets a name. \"Rather than just say the students were 'in the ensemble,' we gave them all characters. So now you have a Tinkerbell, a pirate,\" Holder explains. \"Not just 'happy villagers' or 'fourth one from the right.' They're actually integral to telling the story. I'm always thinking, 'How can we include as many students in as many ways possible?'\" For Holder, another thing that didn't work was the role of the Fairy Godmother. In the shortened script, her character had been cut substantially. \"My first thought,\" she says, \"was 'What's up with the Fairy Godmother?' Her part is so small and she's literally the catalyst for all the change in the story.\" Holder decided to shine a little more light on that character by giving her a solo. Crafting the look and feel  When a show has been in circulation awhile — performed by many schools — there's lots of inspiration for sets and costumes. Take  The Addams Family,  for example. The show has been performed thousands of times now. Theater directors and cast members can surf YouTube and get tons of ideas. But Holder and her team must start from scratch. For help designing the costumes, they turned to local middle and high school students for ideas and used a local costume shop to make them. The sets were also made locally, designed and built by a theater tech class at Nova Southeastern University. In late May, at the final dress rehearsal, the students get to see what it's like to move and perform in their costumes — and to see how they look next to the colorful sets and props. \"My costume is shiny and blue and awesome,\" explains Prince Charming, otherwise known as Jay Hendrix, 17. He's wearing a blue sequined blazer with a bright yellow sash and a white ruffled collar. \"So it's this huge, deep purple maxi dress with, like, a lot — a lot! — of tulle on the sleeves,\" says Eden Gross, 14, who plays the Fairy Godmother. Those costumes and the sets will be photographed and included in the resource guide provided to schools when they buy this junior version next year. That means what they do in Fort Lauderdale will be duplicated — and perhaps set the standard — for schools and regional theaters for years to come. I can't get these songs out of my head Backstage at the final run-through, it's hard to escape the constant humming and singing of all the Britney Spears songs in the show — a constant, overlapping montage of  Circus,   ... Baby One More Time ,  Toxic  and, a personal favorite, the ballad  Everytime .   Before spending time with these students, we thought the Spears canon might appeal more to parents buying tickets than to students who hadn't even been born yet when these songs were on the radio. Wrong! \"We're such big fans,\" says Alanna Maurer, 18, who plays Esmerelda. \"Ever since I came out of the womb, I've been singing her songs,\" says Noa Anker, 15, who plays Cinderella. \"I had all the songs memorized on the first day of rehearsal,\" explains Chloe Catty, 14, who plays Rapunzel. \"She's a pop idol. She's an icon. She's a queen!\" says Daniel Zelfman, 13, who plays a prince. The energy backstage is exciting, but everyone also knows it's down to the wire. Tomorrow is opening night. That means this is the final opportunity to fix or change anything. Nerves are high. One of the performers is throwing up in the bathroom. But they work out the snags. They figure out the perfect combination of sound effects and lighting design for the scene where Cinderella decides to break out of her story and smashes her glass slipper. And when the curtain falls on the finale — a huge dance number with the entire cast that includes a medley of all the upbeat songs from the show — the students erupt in cheers from the stage. Things are really coming together. \"Y'all ... we've got a show!\" Holder yells from the audience. Beyond the show, student theater is a place of joy and belonging  On opening night, Holder gathers the cast in a circle backstage. The theater is packed, and parents, family and friends are buzzing with anticipation. The student performers hold hands and close their eyes. Tinkerbell's fairy wings are all smushed up against Fairy Godmother's humongous tulle sleeves. \"You are incredible,\" Holder tells them. \"You are the joy we need in this world.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Student theater, for Holder and so many others, is ultimately about believing in the power of imagination to build community and find your voice. \"It's not just about putting on costumes and doing a show; it's everything else around it,\" says Prignano from Music Theatre International, who will see this show in Florida a day after opening. \"Theater gives you confidence in who you are and what you can do in a way that other things don't,\" he says. \"The tools that you learn expands to everything in life.\" Holder agrees. \"Students are drawn to theater because it is a place of belonging and a place to be heard,\" she says. \"If the world could just put on a show!\" A hush falls over the theater as the spotlights illuminate the thick red curtain, and the narrator, played by Yair Gerges, takes his spot in the center. \"Places, everyone!\"   As the story unfolds, the cast all hit their marks. The costumes look incredible, the lights catching all those sequins and the glitter. Cinderella delivers when she shatters that glass shoe. The timing, the lights — it all works perfectly. There are a few hiccups: One cast member is out sick. An important prop is forgotten backstage. And there are a few microphone glitches. But all that is part of the charm of student theater. This show may not have worked on Broadway two years ago, but this shorter, revamped version, filled with emotion and energy from the teenage performers, gets a standing ovation for almost every song here in Fort Lauderdale. Weeks later, when the show finally wraps, the work shifts back to Music Theatre International, the company that owns the junior version. It will incorporate what these students learned and changed into the final junior version, set to be released to schools next year. If the crowd's response in Florida was any indication,  Once Upon a One More Time   Jr.  will have audiences across the country on their feet and dancing.

So when a show flops or has a short run in New York, it's not over. But adapting a Broadway musical for teenagers is a special challenge, as I found out spending time backstage in Florida. Let's start on opening night. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Follow me now. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: I'm changing, I'm changing, I'm changing. NADWORNY: We're backstage at the Broward Center Performing Arts theater in Fort Lauderdale. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: Does anybody have eyeshadow? NADWORNY: Students from across south Florida are getting ready to perform. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: I can't believe the show is tonight. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Onstage, please. NADWORNY: It's a musical that's new to student theater. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"...BABY ONE MORE TIME\") NOA ANKER: (As Cinderella, singing) Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know? NADWORNY: Yep, you know that music. It's Britney Spears. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"...BABY ONE MORE TIME\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Show me how you want it to be. NADWORNY: These students are resuscitating the 2023 show that lasted just three months on Broadway. This version is \"Once Upon A One More Time Jr.,\" meant mostly for tweens and young teenagers. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As character) There's the charming girls, and Cinderella is nowhere to be found. NADWORNY: It's a pilot production. The students here are among the first in the country to perform it, to test it out. After the original show closed on Broadway, Music Theatre International got the licensing rights for students and reworked the script. When it's available, schools will pay a flat fee and get the junior script and score and a guide to putting it on. To see if it actually works onstage... TAMMY HOLDER: We're going to change to opening just a little bit, not a lot. NADWORNY: ...The company turned to a handful of schools and regional theaters, including this one in Florida. HOLDER: Quiet in the house, please. Quiet on the stage. This is sound check. NADWORNY: Tammy Holder is the theater director here... HOLDER: Sing nice and loud, (singing) oh, baby, baby. NADWORNY: ...And let me and producer Lauren Migaki sit in on rehearsals leading up to opening night. Now, not all Broadway shows can work for students. But \"Once Upon A One More Time\" has a lot of things going for it, especially the makeup of the cast. HOLDER: Because it's, like, 25 girls and two boys. It's every theater program in the country. NADWORNY: The catchy music helps. Plus, the plot has themes about belonging and individuality that really resonate with student performers. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #5: (As character) Once upon a time, there was a girl who wanted more. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) NADWORNY: The story centers on Cinderella, who wants to break out of her fairy-tale story and build her own happily ever after. ANKER: She definitely sort of fits in that princess persona. NADWORNY: Cinderella is played here by 15-year-old Noa Anker. ANKER: She's sort of a romantic. But she realizes that her prince is, like, a little bit unloyal. JAY HENDRIX: They discover that I'm actually all of the different princesses' princes. So I'm Cinderella's prince, Little Mermaid's prince, etc. NADWORNY: Jay Hendrix, 17, was cast as Prince Charming. HENDRIX: (As Prince Charming) Princes, we're just different. ANKER: (As Cinderella) That's all you have to say for yourself? HENDRIX: (As Prince Charming) Oops. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS!…I DID IT AGAIN\") HENDRIX: (As Prince Charming, singing) I think I did it again. NADWORNY: Yep, that's the 2000 megahit \"Oops!…I Did It Again.\" And how could you have a storyline with cheating and not use Britney's hit \"Womanizer\"? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WOMANIZER\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Womanizer, woman womanizer. You're a womanizer. Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer. NADWORNY: We thought perhaps the Britney canon catered more to parents buying tickets, since most of the students in this performance weren't even born when these songs were on the radio. But we were wrong. Had you guys heard about Britney Spears before this musical? UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: Yes. NADWORNY: (Laughter). ALANA MAUER: I'm a huge Britney fan, for sure. Yeah. CHLOE CATTY: I had, like, all the songs memorized on the first day of rehearsal. DANIEL ZELFMAN: She's a pop idol. ANKER: Ever since I came out of the womb, I've been singing her songs. CATTY: (Laughter). NADWORNY: Those were students Alana Mauer (ph), Chloe Catty (ph), Daniel Zelfman (ph) and Noa Anker. The junior version is way shorter, so songs and scenes and subplots are cut, including some that might be controversial or not age appropriate. But the story still has to make sense onstage. HOLDER: Who missed the stairs for Prince Charming? NADWORNY: Which is something they're figuring out when we arrive at rehearsals a few days before opening night. HOLDER: All right. Today, we have a big challenge. She's supposed to break the glass slipper. NADWORNY: It's the pivotal scene where Cinderella decides to break out of her story and smashes the glass slipper, essentially a metaphor for this whole show. HOLDER: Pick up the shoe, and then just - so just pick it up like you're going to smack him with it. Pick it up. And then you say... HENDRIX: (As Prince Charming) What do you think you're doing? HOLDER: Shroom. (SOUNDBITE OF GLASS SHATTERING) NADWORNY: Obviously, broken glass on a stage is a no-go. HOLDER: Hey, Dan (ph), can that crash be even louder? DAN: Oh, yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF GLASS SHATTERING) HOLDER: Oh, I don't hate that. NADWORNY: So Noa and Jay work to time their movements onstage with the lights and the sound... HOLDER: Throw it down. NADWORNY: ...To make it look like Cinderella is smashing the shoe. ANKER: (As Cinderella, singing) I am stronger. HOLDER: Crash. (SOUNDBITE OF GLASS SHATTERING) HOLDER: Lights. Swing. Right here. Hold. Wow. OK. NADWORNY: The timing has to be perfect. HOLDER: Let's see what happens. I don't know what's going to happen. NADWORNY: Part of piloting the show means sets and costumes, too. A theater tech class at nearby Nova Southeastern University designed and built the sets. And then local middle and high school students... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Oh, that's cute. NADWORNY: ...Helped dream up what the costumes looked like. Those sets and costumes and tweaks they've made will be photographed and duplicated and perhaps set the standard for other schools and regional theaters for decades to come. EDEN GROSS: It's so glittery and sparkly. NADWORNY: At dress rehearsal, the night before opening, the students get to finally perform in those outfits. Here are students Eden Gross (ph) and Sienna Antone Mate Jiggins (ph). GROSS: I just love it. SIENNA ANTONE MATE JIGGINS: So it's this huge, like, deep purple maxi dress with, like, a lot of tulle on the sleeves. NADWORNY: It's down to the wire and nerves are high - one of the kids is throwing up in the bathroom - because the final rehearsal is the last chance to fix anything. HOLDER: Can we see the Little Mermaid? NADWORNY: Jenna Hubert (ph) twirls in her tight purple dress. HOLDER: Oh, look at you. Can you move and like... JENNA HUBERT: I can move. HOLDER: ...Not fall on the floor and everything? And it's... HUBERT: I can do that. HOLDER: OK. Y'all. We got a show. (CHEERING) NADWORNY: So by opening night, it's time to see if this thing is going to come together and work as a show that other schools across the country can perform. HENDRIX: Show day. NADWORNY: The producers from the licensing company, MTI, will be in the audience taking notes. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #6: (Harmonizing). YETYER GIRGIS: Got to stay calm. NADWORNY: Yetyer Girgis (ph) is gearing up to open the show as the narrator. GIRGIS: You got to lock in. The main thing is lock in. HOLDER: Stand up tall. NADWORNY: Holder gathers the cast in a circle backstage. HOLDER: Take a deep breath in. NADWORNY: They hold hands and close their eyes. Tinker Bell's fairy wings are all smooshed up against Rapunzel's hair extensions. HOLDER: Let it out in a big sigh. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: Ah. HOLDER: We have a story to tell. NADWORNY: Ultimately, tonight, and student theater in general, is about believing in the power of imagination to build community and find a voice. HOLDER: You know I'm a crier (laughter). There is such a light in each of you. And it puts beauty in the world, and it puts joy in the world. So when you get out there tonight, shine that light. NADWORNY: And they do shine. (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"ONCE UPON A ONE MORE TIME JR.\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #7: (As character) Read me a story. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #8: (As character) A fairy tale. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters) Fairy tale. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #9: A fairy tale. NADWORNY: The costumes look incredible and sequin-y and bright. The cast hits all their marks. Cinderella delivers. When she shatters that glass shoe, the timing, the lights, it's pretty convincing. (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"ONCE UPON A ONE MORE TIME JR.\") ANKER: (As Cinderella, singing) I am stronger. (SOUNDBITE OF GLASS SHATTERING LOUD) NADWORNY: Now, this show might not have gotten a long run on Broadway two years ago. But with the changes and the heart from the teenage performers... (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"ONCE UPON A ONE MORE TIME JR.\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Once upon a - give me a sign - once upon a... NADWORNY: ...The audience in Fort Lauderdale give nearly every song a standing ovation. (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"ONCE UPON A ONE MORE TIME JR.\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Once upon a one more... UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #10: (As character) Once upon a time. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) ...Time. (CHEERING) NADWORNY: After the show wrapped back in June, MTI has been incorporating what these students learned and changed into the final junior version. And that will be available for schools to perform starting next year. (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"ONCE UPON A ONE MORE TIME JR.\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) All eyes on me in the center of the ring just like a circus. When I crack that whip everybody going to trip just like a circus. Don't stand there watching me. Follow me, show me what you can do. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589774","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"14:21:00Z","title":"How this week's elections in Virginia became about ... everything","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Virginia's gubernatorial election in November 2025 has shifted from a traditional economic race to a multifaceted political referendum.

Barthel, Brad Kutner \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 2:21 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Several late-breaking surprises have shaken up what political watchers thought would be a quiet race in Virginia. The commonwealth's gubernatorial race — one of just two held the year after presidential elections — is often seen as a temperature check on how voters feel about leaders in Washington. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee and former congresswoman, has maintained a lead in polls since very early in the race over Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. But this year, while  voters' top concerns  are energy prices, housing affordability and jobs, the rest of the race has become a referendum on everything from political violence to redistricting. Here, public media journalists across Virginia take us into each issue. DOGE and the federal government shutdown The challenges  facing Virginia's 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors came long before the Oct. 1 government shutdown. Earlier this year, during Elon Musk's DOGE efforts, thousands of Virginians were laid off. Democrats in the commonwealth hope that voter anger over the firings and furloughs will carry them to victory on Tuesday night. On the campaign trail, Spanberger talks about sticking up for federal workers in the face of the \"chaos from Washington.\" At a campaign event Thursday, Spanberger put it this way: \"The stakes of this election are serious.\" As furloughs stretch into a second month, Virginia Republicans have also seen a political opening in the shutdown. \"My opponent, all summer long, has been playing political football with federal workers by trying to say that she loves them more than anyone else,\" Earle-Sears said on the debate stage, and then criticized Spanberger for encouraging Democrats in Congress to resist any funding deal that doesn't include continuing health care subsidies. But Earle-Sears hasn't shied away from the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce. She has said she believes claims of \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" and argues that the impact of layoffs in Virginia will be minimal due to the economic strength she and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin have stewarded over the previous four years. Political violence A scandal in the race for attorney general has reverberated up the ticket. Early last month,  text messages from 2022  show Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general and a former member of the Virginia legislature, describing hypothetical violence against a political opponent. Earle-Sears and other Republican candidates have tried to tie the text messages to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, painting Democrats as politically violent. Spanberger condemned the messages and political violence generally, but didn't withdraw or double down on her endorsement of Jones. \"It is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information,\" she said in the gubernatorial debate. Jones' Republican opponent, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, is appealing to Spanberger voters to split their tickets. Redistricting  Democrats in the Virginia legislature threw another wrench into the campaign last week by calling a surprise series of meetings after North Carolina became another state to redraw its congressional map to favor the GOP at the behest of President Trump. On Friday, the Virginia legislature proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms. Because it needs to be approved by legislators again next year before voters can finalize the amendment next spring, its success depends on Spanberger winning her race and Democrats maintaining control of the House of Delegates. How much the redistricting plan changes voters' minds is up for debate. Close to a million voters cast their ballots before the Democrats announced their plan, while the redistricting session took delegates off the trail during the final full week of campaigning. Earle-Sears, who presides over the state Senate in her role as lieutenant governor, was also called back to Richmond. She still managed to hold events  around the state , and a press conference on the steps of the Virginia Capitol, while a small crowd held \"Winsome For Governor\" signs. Spanberger has made few public comments about redistricting, beyond signaling her  general support . Transgender youth Republicans up and down the ballot have made Virginia's transgender youth a major campaign issue. The argument over transgender athletes and bathrooms in Virginia schools really took off when Republican Glenn Youngkin made it a focus of his 2021 campaign for governor. Arguably, it helped him become the first GOP governor elected in more than a decade. But, despite Republicans spending millions on ads around transgender students in 2025,  recent polling  shows it's a top concern for 3 percent of voters. The economy and countering Trump's policies are at the forefront of most voters' minds. Spanberger has said she likely leads on the subject because Republicans have been \"villainizing kids.\" \"Particularly efforts to heavily politicize a group of kids who need a bit of grace, and the adults around them to show thoughtfulness,\" the former congresswoman said. \"I'm not taking a stand because it's the easy thing to do. Of course, it's not easy. I'm being abused for it,\" Earle-Sears  said , comparing her support for cisgender students to the civil rights movement.

Try thinking less \n         By Andee Tagle, Clare Marie Schneider \n        \n           Tuesday, June 3, 2025 • 9:36 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Life is filled with big decisions. Should you move across the country? Start a business? Have a baby? Break up? If you're not sure what to do,  Nell Wulfhart  has some counterintuitive advice. Don't keep deliberating. In fact, spend less time thinking about it. In her over 10 years as a decision coach, Wulfhart has helped more than 600 people, from CEOs to artists, make difficult choices. She says nearly all her clients are able to find clarity within an hour of working together. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In her experience, \"most people take way too long to make decisions. They get mired down in the analysis,\" she says. That's partly due to a fear of regret, Wulfhart says. \"Everyone is trying so hard to avoid that uncomfortable feeling.\" But part of getting unstuck is accepting that some regret is inevitable. If you're struggling with indecision, Wulfhart offers exercises and advice to help you make faster choices with more confidence. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. How do you make good decisions quickly?  There are two exercises I give every client. First, make a list of your values. Not moral or corporate values, but the things that make your life good on a daily basis. Mine include: never setting an alarm clock, being able to wear sweatpants all the time, being in warm weather. Put them in order of importance. Then when you're making a decision, go down the list and see which one of your options checks more boxes on that list of values. The second exercise is to sketch out your ideal life in one year's, five years' and 10 years' time. Once you have written down what you'd like your life to look like, take the options you're deciding between and see whether you can draw a straight line from that option to the life you want. Can you share an example of these exercises in practice?  I had a client who had a job offer that was better paid and more prestigious. On paper, that seemed like an easy decision: Take the job. But in five years, she wanted to have a thriving business of her own, a business that was so successful she could take time off to spend with her kids. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       We decided she should stay in her current job, save money and start working very hard at building her own business, so that in five years she could actually have the thing she wanted. Can you speak to the role of regret when it comes to making decisions?  The decision-making business is really just the regret-minimization business. And because my big thing is about getting people to make decisions faster, we just have to accept that yes, occasionally, we will regret our choice. We can eliminate a lot of regret by just moving faster. Many more people regret taking too long to make a decision than making a decision too quickly. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you spend a year trying to figure out if you should go to grad school or three years deciding if you should get engaged, I've found that people regret the time they have lost deciding so much more than the occasional decision they made too hastily. What are some other ways we can minimize regret in decision-making?  People who feel less regret are people who are able to say, \"I made the best decision I could with the information I had at the time, and this outcome — I couldn't know it in advance.\" We are just taking our best possible guess at the time with the information we have. Sometimes that thing is not gonna work out. It turns out your new boss is a micromanager or your new apartment has rats.  Those things were impossible to know when you were making the decision. The outcome is mostly outside our control. The decision is entirely within our control. You also talk about testing things out. The way we make good decisions is not by sitting at home and wondering if we're going to like something. It is by trying the thing out. Then we have actual, tangible data that tells us whether or not we like something. I coached somebody once who was thinking about becoming a social worker. I told them, before you commit tens of thousands of dollars and two years of your life to getting this master's in social work, why don't you spend a few days shadowing someone who is a social worker?   You say that asking too many people for their advice can actually make it tougher to make a choice. Why is that?  By the time someone comes to me, sometimes they've talked to 10 or 20 different people. It just really muddies the waters. They're not helping you make the decision. When making a big decision, talk to three to five people and that's it. Think about your past history with everyone and ask yourself: Does this person support me and give good advice? If you know you are talking to somebody whose values are different from yours, who doesn't respect the way you live your life, or who always has negative things to say about your choices, do not talk to them. Make the decision and then tell them that's what you've decided to do. Why do some people double down on decisions they know might be bad for them, but feel like they should stick to?  People think all the time about sunk costs: the time they've put into something, the money they've invested, the years of building the relationship. They spend almost no time thinking about the opportunity costs. They might be missing out on job opportunities or relationship opportunities by staying in a situation that's not what they want. Even just trying to get to the thing you actually want is usually more rewarding. But people are very attached to their sunk costs. It can be hard to convince them to leave those behind.

It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else. In 2008, Kate Elsley was working as a nurse practitioner in Redwood City, a suburb of San Francisco. Every day, she would commute from her home in the city, first taking a train and then walking the rest of the way to her office. Most days, the trip wasn't noteworthy. But in 2008, Proposition 8 had just been announced. It was a ballot measure aimed to outlaw same-sex marriage in California and her commute now took her past sign after sign supporting the ban. \"It was very emotional for me to walk by businesses or people's homes that had signs supporting Prop 8 because I just would always think, 'Why do they hate me?'\" Elsley said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She found herself imagining what it would be like to confront the businesses and homeowners displaying Prop 8 signs. \"I would want to go up to the front door and just sort of present myself and say, 'This is my face. I'm gay and I love my soon-to-be wife. And why do you think it's not OK for us to have the same rights that you do?'\" But then, one cold morning, Elsley got off the train and saw an older man silently standing on the platform opposite her. He was holding a sign that declared he was against Prop 8. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I just was so impressed that he was brave enough to come out on a cold morning when he could have stayed at home where it was nice and warm, and to be standing there all by himself,\" Elsley recalled. Worried she'd be late for work, she wasn't able to stop and thank him. \"But I am so, so grateful to him. It just felt like such an unsafe time to love who I did, and feel like people were against us and actively campaigning to take away something that I knew was going to make me happy.\" Elsley and her wife have now been married for 17 years. But Elsley will never forget that cold morning in 2008. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"To this day, when someone talks about an act of kindness, I usually get tears in my eyes, and I wish that I could go back and meet that gentleman and say thank you.

by a defender when he stuck his left arm out and put his hand on the ground. That’s when a dismal night for the Washington Commanders turned downright horrifying. Daniels’ nonthrowing arm bent gruesomely, and the star quarterback had to leave Washington’s 38-14 loss to Seattle on Sunday night with 7:29 remaining in the fourth quarter. It’s the third — and perhaps the most significant — injury of the season for Daniels, who was in his first game back from a hamstring issue. “It’s really tough to see him go down. You just want him to stay positive,” Commanders linebacker Bobby Wagner said. “You don’t know what the result is. You just speak a lot of positivity into existence. He’s a very positive person so we’re just praying for the best.” AP AUDIO: Jayden Daniels leaves game after Washington QB’s nonthrowing arm bends gruesomely The NFL’s reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year exited with a significant injury late during a lopsided defeat. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports. Commanders coach Dan Quinn said Daniels injured his elbow. That was about the extent of the postgame update. Quinn didn’t have much of an explanation for why Daniels was still in the game. Washington was trailing 38-7 at the time. “Obviously like the hindsight, you don’t want to think that way, where an injury could take place,” Quinn said. “Obviously we’re more conservative in that spot to run and hand off and not have reads to go, but just the end result — obviously, I’m bummed.” Related Stories Bengals’ nightmare season hits the midway point at 3-6 after two devastating losses 4 MIN READ Sam Darnold doing more than enough for surging Seahawks, off to best start since 2020 3 MIN READ Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu suspended for game by NFL for repeated hip-drop tackles 1 MIN READ In addition to the hamstring injury, Daniels also missed two games earlier this season with knee issues. Although an injury to Daniels’ non-throwing arm isn’t necessarily career altering, Commanders fans could hardly be blamed for immediately fearing the worst. It was on this same field about 13 years ago — against the same opponent — that Robert Griffin III went down with a severe knee injury at the end of his sensational rookie season for Washington. He never reached those heights again. The Commanders fell behind early Sunday and trailed 31-7 at halftime, and Daniels had to do plenty of scrambling. He ended up running for 51 yards on 10 carries, and the injury underscored the risk in doing that. “I think that’s his nature. He wants to be aggressive and make plays,” Quinn said. “He’s got confidence in the other players. I do know that. So it’s not like, ‘I have to do more, I have to do things that are outside of playing in that way.’ We also have to have everybody. Injuries happen and you hate it.” As a rookie last season, Daniels led Washington to the NFC championship game — its best season since 1991. Now the Commanders are 3-6 after four straight losses. If the season can be salvaged, it may have to be with Marcus Mariota at quarterback. During those moments when Daniels was slow to get up, however, it was the long-term future that seemed like the bigger issue. “I didn’t see what happened exactly. I just heard a pause and I kind of put my head down and prayed for him,” Commanders guard Sam Cosmi said. “You just don’t want to see that happen.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590944","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:02:00-04:00","title":"How a great-grandmother helped researchers unravel a dinosaur mummy mystery","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A team led by paleontologist Paul Sereno used a historical connection involving a rancher’s great-grandmother, who was the postmaster of the fictional town of Warren, Wyoming, to locate the site where Charles Sternberg discovered a dinosaur mummy in 1908.

1, 2025 • 6:02 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         You might not think a paleontologist looking for 66-million-year-old fossils would need to ask a rancher about his great-grandmother's job in the Wyoming badlands. But that's what Paul Sereno, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago, did when he was trying to track down a historic site where a famous dinosaur mummy was found in 1908. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sereno's work, published in the journal   Science , brings new clarity about the appearance of the duck-billed  Edmontosaurus annectens , a massive herbivore from the Cretaceous period. Sereno and his team's painstaking work reveals the dinosaur's hooves and spiky tail in exquisite detail. They studied how a fragile clay template can create dinosaur \"mummies.\" But first they had to find them. \"It involved sleuthing archives and finding photographs from these original excavations that no one knew of, and then also talking to ranchers,\" Sereno says of the research. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Looking for a post office  Sereno was hunting for the spot where the famed collector Charles Sternberg discovered a dinosaur mummy in the rough terrain of eastern Wyoming. He managed to find historical photos and a note from Sternberg recounting his path to the site, back in the era of horse-drawn carriages. There were references to Warren, Wyo., — a town that, Sereno says, \"doesn't exist on any map.\" So, he asked around at nearby ranches. \"One of the ranchers had a great-grandmother that was the postmaster of Warren, Wyoming,\" Sereno says. In those days, the post office was on a ranch, he adds. \"And from that, I can calculate a distance to one of the mummies that were found in 1908,\" Sereno says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The area has come to be known as \"the mummy zone,\" where a very thick layer of river sand captured dinosaurs' bodies and preserved valuable information about them. As technicians removed grains of sand from the  Edmontosaurus  specimens, Sereno was fascinated by what they found. \"A mummy is actually a mask of the body, very thin, like the clay you'd put on your face to clean out your pores,\" he says of their specimens. \"And that's what's trapped in the sediment, and not a replacement of the actual skin.\" Vital details about the large dinosaur were captured in fragile clay templates, just one-hundredth of an inch thick. \"For once, we know what a large dinosaur looks like from head to toe,\" Sereno says. \"We've got the bill at the front end, the hooves ... and samples of everything in between, including the crest on the back, the spikes on the tail. We know it, and you could depict it, and it's accurate.\" \"With one exception,\" he adds. \"We don't know the color.\" The two specimens include an adult nicknamed \"Ed Sr.\" and a late juvenile dubbed \"Ed Jr.\" — \"the only juvenile dinosaur mummy ever discovered,\"  according to the university . \"The feet are beautiful\" Sereno's study quickly caught the eye of other experts on the duckbill dinosaur, including Clint Boyd, the paleontology program manager for the North Dakota Geological Survey. His agency has its own  Edmontosaurus  specimen (\"Dakota the Dinosaur Mummy\"), so I asked Boyd what he thinks of Sereno's study. \"The feet are beautiful,\" Boyd says, adding that the new study jibes with much of his agency's work. Both Boyd and Sereno say that some of the terminology in their field could confuse a layperson. They stress that these mummies are nothing like Egyptian mummies, for instance. And when they say  Edmontosaurus  had hooves, they warn not to think of   a horse hoof. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"What they're talking about is a hoof like what you see on like a rhino, which absolutely that's what it looks like,\" Boyd says, describing a prominent nail in the front of fleshy pads. Boyd says that while Sereno's specimens are different from what he and his colleagues are working on, the new paper resolves important questions and will help drive new research. \"It's a very thorough study, which is great,\" Boyd says. \"We needed a very good baseline for understanding at least one set of dinosaur mummies in order to then have a reference point to start comparing back to other specimens. So this has been a very long-needed addition to the science.\" Kindling an interest in paleontology This isn't Sereno's first dinosaur rodeo. He's  made big discoveries before . His email address doesn't even use his name; instead, it just says, \"dinosaur.\" The mummy study closes a meaningful loop in Sereno's own life. He notes that the prize specimen that sparked his search, unearthed back in 1908, sits in the  American Museum of Natural History  in New York — and it was a visit to that spot, decades ago, that made a huge impact on a Sereno. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"That's when I decided to be a paleontologist,\" he says of standing next to that exhibit. \"Little did I know my career would end up taking me back to where that mummy was discovered by Charles Sternberg more than a century ago.\" Sereno has a message for young fans of dinosaurs and paleontology: \"If you're an enthused kid, thinking, maybe we found everything. No, we have not.\" Plenty of work remains to make new discoveries and solve more mysteries about how dinosaurs lived, he says. \"For the next two generations, we're going to be finding more things about the deep past and about dinosaurs and other creatures than ever,\" Sereno says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/openai-amazon-071e752773dee5713c8b1a10039d08aa","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:28:31+00:00","title":"OpenAI and Amazon Sign $38 Billion AI Infrastructure Deal","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"OpenAI and Amazon have announced a $38 billion deal enabling OpenAI to run its AI systems—such as ChatGPT—on Amazon’s U.S. data centers via AWS, utilizing hundreds of thousands of Nvidia AI chips.

(AP) — OpenAI and Amazon have signed a $38 billion deal that enables the ChatGPT maker to run its artificial intelligence systems on Amazon’s data centers in the U.S. OpenAI will be able to power its AI tools using “hundreds of thousands” of Nvidia’s specialized AI chips through Amazon Web Services as part of the deal announced Monday. Amazon shares increased 4% after the announcement. The agreement comes less than a week after OpenAI altered its partnership with its longtime backer Microsoft, which until early this year was the startup’s exclusive cloud computing provider. California and Delaware regulators also last week allowed San Francisco-based OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit, to move forward on its plan to form a new business structure to more easily raise capital and make a profit. “The rapid advancement of AI technology has created unprecedented demand for computing power,” Amazon said in a statement Monday. It said OpenAI “will immediately start utilizing AWS compute as part of this partnership, with all capacity targeted to be deployed before the end of 2026, and the ability to expand further into 2027 and beyond.” AI requires huge amounts of energy and computing power and OpenAI has long signaled that it needs more capacity, both to develop new AI systems and keep existing products like ChatGPT answering the questions of its hundreds of millions of users. It’s recently made more than $1 trillion worth of financial obligations in spending for AI infrastructure, including data center projects with Oracle and SoftBank and semiconductor supply deals with chipmakers Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom.

Millions of people stand to lose food aid benefits, health care subsidies are set to expire and there are few real talks between the parties over how to end it. President Donald Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday that he “won’t be extorted” by Democrats who are demanding negotiations to extend the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Echoing congressional Republicans, the president said on CBS’ “60 Minutes” he’ll negotiate only when the government is reopened. Trump said Democrats “have lost their way” and predicted they’ll capitulate to Republicans. “I think they have to,” Trump said. “And if they don’t vote, it’s their problem.” Trump’s comments signal the shutdown could drag on for some time as federal workers, including air traffic controllers, are set to miss additional paychecks and there’s uncertainty over whether 42 million Americans who receive federal food aid will be able to access the assistance . Senate Democrats have voted 13 times against reopening the government, insisting they need Trump and Republicans to negotiate with them first. Related Stories What to know about Louisiana Gov.

What questions do you have for them? The president also reiterated his pleas to Republican leaders to change Senate rules and scrap the filibuster . Senate Republicans have repeatedly rejected that idea since Trump’s first term, arguing the rule requiring 60 votes to overcome any objections in the Senate is vital to the institution and has allowed them to stop Democratic policies when they’re in the minority. Trump said that’s true, but “we’re here right now.” Sen.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “Republicans have to get tougher,” Trump told CBS. “If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want.” With the two parties at a standstill, the shutdown, now in its 34th day and approaching its sixth week, appears likely to become the longest in history. The previous record was set in 2019, when Trump demanded Congress give him money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. A potentially decisive week Trump’s push on the filibuster could prove a distraction for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Republican senators who’ve opted instead to stay the course as the consequences of the shutdown become more acute. Monthlong government shutdown in photos: disruptions, delays and divisions With no endgame in sight, the U.S. government shutdown is expected to roll on for the unforeseeable future, injecting more uncertainty into an already precarious economy. Republicans are hoping at least some Democrats will eventually switch their votes as moderates have been in weekslong talks with rank-and-file Republicans about potential compromises that could guarantee votes on health care in exchange for reopening the government. Republicans need five additional Democrats to pass their bill. Thune told reporters Monday that he was “optimistic” that the Senate could vote to reopen the government by the end of the week. But he also added, “If we don’t start seeing some progress or some evidence of that by at least the middle of this week, it’s hard to see how we would finish anything by the end of the week.” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday there’s a group of people talking about ”a path to fix the health care debacle” and a commitment from Republicans not to fire more federal workers. But it’s unclear if those talks could produce a meaningful compromise. Far apart on health care subsidies Trump said in the “60 Minutes” interview that the Affordable Care Act — often known as Obamacare because it was signed and championed by then-President Barack Obama — is “terrible” and if the Democrats vote to reopen the government, “we will work on fixing the bad health care that we have right now.” READ MORE Trump administration says SNAP will be partially funded in November Some Head Start preschools shutter as government shutdown continues Democrats feel differently, arguing that the marketplaces set up by the ACA are working as record numbers of Americans have signed up for the coverage. But they want to extend subsidies first enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic so premiums won’t go up for millions of people on Jan. 1. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said last week that “we want to sit down with Thune, with (House Speaker Mike) Johnson, with Trump, and negotiate a way to address this horrible health care crisis.” No appetite for bipartisanship As Democrats have pushed Trump and Republicans to negotiate, Trump has showed little interest in doing so . He called for an end to the Senate filibuster after a trip to Asia while the government was shut down. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that the president has spoken directly to Thune and Johnson about the filibuster. But a spokesman for Thune said Friday that his position hasn’t changed, and Johnson said Sunday that he believes the filibuster has traditionally been a “safeguard” from far-left policies. Trump said on “60 Minutes” that he likes Thune but “I disagree with him on this point.” The president has spent much of the shutdown mocking Democrats, posting videos of House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries in a Mexican sombrero . The White House website is now featuring a satirical “My Space” page for Democrats, a parody based on the social media site that was popular in the early 2000s. “We just love playing politics with people’s livelihoods,” the page reads. AP AUDIO: Government shutdown could become longest ever as Trump says he ‘won’t be extorted’ by Democrats The government shutdown could be a record-breaker. AP correspondent Mike Hempen reports. Democrats have repeatedly said that they need Trump to get serious and weigh in. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said that he hopes the shutdown could end “this week” because Trump is back in Washington. Republicans “can’t move on anything without a Trump sign off,” Warner said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.

That came amid intensifying delays at the nation’s airports and multiple missed paydays for hundreds of thousands of federal workers. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on ABC’s “This Week” that there have already been delays at several airports “and it’s only going to get worse.” Many of the workers are “confronted with a decision,” he said. “Do I put food on my kids’ table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?” As flight delays around the country increased , New York City’s emergency management department posted on Sunday that Newark Airport was under a ground delay because of “staffing shortages in the control tower” and that they were limiting arrivals to the airport. “The average delay is about 2 hours, and some flights are more than 3 hours late,” the account posted.

That left the program in uncertainty with no clear indication of how much beneficiaries will receive or when their cards will be loaded to buy groceries. House Democratic leader Jeffries, D-N.Y., accused Trump and Republicans of attempting to “weaponize hunger.” He said that the administration has managed to find ways for funding other priorities during the shutdown, but is slow-walking pushing out SNAP benefits despite the court orders. “But somehow they can’t find money to make sure that Americans don’t go hungry,” Jeffries said in an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.” ___ Associated Press writer Aamer Madhani contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/uk-train-stabbings-what-to-know-b167cc0b87ae4d442dbe9bafd6966b62","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"11:39:59+00:00","title":"Man Charged with Attempted Murder After Train Stabbing in England","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A stabbing attack occurred on a train traveling from Doncaster to London’s King’s Cross station, en route through Peterborough, when it was about halfway through its journey.

speeding through eastern England. Police on Monday charged a 32-year-old man with attempted murder over the attack on Saturday evening, which left almost a dozen people injured. Another man who was arrested initially was released. Police are still working to uncover a motive, but say it doesn’t appear to be an act of terrorism. Here’s what to know: The train was heading for London The train left Doncaster in northern England at 6:25 p.m., bound for London’s King’s Cross station. It was about halfway into its 2-hour journey and had just departed from a stop at Peterborough when police began receiving calls about people being stabbed onboard. Passengers described panicked travelers, some covered in blood, rushing down the aisle of the train to get away from the carriage where the violence was unfolding. Olly Foster said he heard someone yelling, “Run, run, there is a guy stabbing literally everyone,” and at first thought it was a Halloween prank — until he noticed blood on his hand from touching seats in the train carriage. “Everyone was really pushing behind us, really panicking,” Foster told the BBC. He said he saw several people bleeding heavily from wounds. Police responded within minutes The British Transport Police, which handles security on the railways, said it received the first emergency calls at 7:42 p.m. Within minutes, several dozen police officers, including specialist firearms officers, and paramedics were at the train station in Huntingdon, a town about 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of London.

Police investigating several other knife-related incidents British Transport Police said that within eight minutes of the first emergency calls, officers from Cambridgeshire Constabulary had boarded the train and detained two men. Witnesses said officers used a Taser to subdue one suspect who was holding a large knife. Police later released one of the detained men, a 35-year-old British citizen, without charge, saying detectives had established that he was not involved in the attack. The other man, 32-year-old Anthony Williams, was charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one of actual bodily harm and one of possession of a bladed article. Williams, a British citizen from the city of Peterborough, was also charged with attempted murder over a separate incident at Pontoon Dock light rail station in London earlier Saturday. He was remanded in custody after a brief court appearance Monday. Investigators say they are looking at three other knife-related incidents in Peterborough on Friday and Saturday that may be linked to the train attack, including the stabbing of a 14-year-old in the city center on Friday night. The teen suffered minor injuries. Police say they are not looking for anyone else. One victim still in critical condition Police said 10 people were taken to nearby hospitals and an 11th went to a hospital on their own. One train staff member who tried to stop the attack was in a critical but stable condition. Police called his actions “nothing short of heroic.” Four other people remained in the hospital. Police seek a motive but say it’s not terror Police Supt. John Loveless said counterterror police were initially called in to support the investigation, but that “at this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident.” He said the investigation is being led by British Transport Police, and “it would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause of this incident.” Leaders express sympathy Senior politicians and royalty expressed concern and sympathy for the victims and their friends and families. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood paid tribute “to the exceptional bravery of staff and passengers on the train.” King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla were “appalled and shocked.” “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” the royal couple said in a statement. “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/new-england-aquarium-penguins-geriatric-451b962c7e39ebf65eaa76fbf64249ec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"13:10:59+00:00","title":"New England Aquarium Launches Geriatric Island for Aging African Penguins","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The New England Aquarium in Boston has created a dedicated geriatric island for its aging African penguins, including Lambert, a 33-year-old one-eyed penguin with glaucoma and chronic inflammation.

The care model emphasizes early detection of health issues, with staff closely observing changes in movement and behavior. The initiative is not only relevant to animal science but also resonates with human audiences, as it parallels the challenges and needs of aging populations, with visitors like Terri Blessman drawing parallels between penguin aging and human elder care.","keyTakeAways":["African penguins are living significantly longer in captivity than in the wild, with some reaching their 40s, due to improved care and protection from environmental threats like pollution and overfishing.","The New England Aquarium has created a dedicated geriatric island for aging African penguins to ensure their safety and well-being, isolating them from younger, more aggressive peers.","Lambert, a 33-year-old one-eyed African penguin with glaucoma and chronic inflammation, is a key example of the care being provided to aging animals, including daily eye drops and anti-inflammatory treatments.","The care model includes enhanced monitoring, specialized treatments (like arthritis and eye care), and environmental modifications such as padded walkways and carpeted paths for easier navigation.","The initiative reflects a broader trend in zoos and aquariums to rethink animal aging, recognizing that animals live longer in captivity and require tailored, age-specific care similar to human elder care."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Lambert","whatIsThisEntity":"A 33-year-old African penguin at the New England Aquarium who is one-eyed, has glaucoma, and chronic inflammation;

But he couldn’t be placed in just any nursing home — because he is a critically endangered African penguin. Instead, the New England Aquarium in Boston, where the 33-year-old Lambert was born and has lived his entire life, decided in February to open a geriatric island for him and its six other aging penguins.

It’s like, ‘Oh, well, why don’t we give them an old folks home?’” Eric Fox, associate curator of penguins at the aquarium, said. “But the more we were looking at their welfare data and understanding what ailments they go through, what physical limitations they have, we started to realize that we were on to something.” The rocky island near the aquarium entrance is set apart from the rest of the 38-bird colony, ensuring the older penguins don’t have to compete for territory with their often aggressive, younger peers. These penguins, with their trademark black and white feathers, stand about 2 feet (0.6 meters) tall and weigh about as much as a large house cat.

The aquarium has built a stand in front of the island, which makes it easier for the penguins to hop out of the water.

The concept was inspired by a larger concern that is confronting zoos and aquariums around the world — what to do when their animals are surviving far longer than their counterparts in the wild. In the case of these African penguins, some are in their 30s and one lived into its 40s. That is twice as long as they would live in the wilds of South Africa and Namibia, due to threats like pollution and lack of food from humans’ overfishing.

Caring for the aging penguins goes far beyond a safer enclosure. The older birds get more checkups than their younger counterparts, and veterinarians offer them treatment for ailments that might be familiar to older humans — such as supplements and anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis and joint pain, and eye drops for glaucoma. There are also more cameras around the island, so staff can better monitor the birds. “We are just keeping a little closer of an eye on some of these older birds,” Luzietti said. “It’s important that we’re picking up on those — from how someone’s hips are moving, how they’re walking, how they are acting, if someone’s squinting. The smallest change day to day can be hiding a really big secret.” On a recent day, Luzietti was in the geriatric enclosure tending to Lambert — who seemed content to stand at the top of the island with his mate Dyer III, preening one another and occasionally letting out a loud call that sounded like a donkey’s bray. He previously had his left eye removed due to an infection and has glaucoma in his right eye. He also suffers from chronic inflammation. Luzietti coaxed him down from his perch, and soon he was sitting on her lap, getting ready for his daily dose of eye drops.

start Game 7 of the World Series. By the time countryman Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered the final out, Tokyo was erupting with joy. “I am so proud today to be Japanese,” said cab driver Seiichiro Okada, who pulled his car to the side of the road to watch the ending. “To be able to watch these legends in real time is something else.” Ohtani had two hits and also pitched, while Yamamoto earned World Series MVP after yet another stellar pitching performance as the Dodgers repeated as champions by beating the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 in 11 innings. Los Angeles trailed 3-0 and 4-2 but rallied with a tying homer from Miguel Rojas in the ninth inning and a tiebreaking homer by Will Smith in the 11th. “I thought it was over for a second, but it was great,” said Hiroshi Hoshii, who was visibly teary-eyed. Hoshii was among a big crowd of baseball fans spilling out into the street from Hub, a Tokyo fish-and-chips restaurant with several large screens where the game was shown live. After the Dodgers’ victory, cheering people wearing Ohtani No. 17 jerseys broke out in dance at the Hub. They were among the millions of Japanese celebrating the Game 7 victory.

I am so moved,” said Yoshiyuki Kosaka, an Oshu resident and avid Ohtani fan. Oshu Mayor Jun Kuranari said he was looking forward to more achievements from Ohtani. “He is greatly respected around the world as a superstar not only for his baseball but for his character. He is definitely the pride and joy of this town,” said Kuranari. The Dodgers were heavy favorites in the World Series but got a tough test from the Blue Jays, including one game that went 18 innings and a nail-biting 3-1 victory in Game 6 to force the winner-take-all showdown in Toronto. Most Japanese were watching at home. Games 1 and 2 averaged 10.7 million viewers in Japan, and Game 7 was likely to eclipse that. Baseball fans in Japan say they had watched every game, even those who came home after working night shifts. Delivery workers said they watched whenever they could on their trucks. Ohtani has been a star in baseball-mad Japan since he was an amateur, and his likeness is now everywhere here, including on ads for sneakers, cosmetics, electronics and more. Fans are proud of his extraordinary two-way prowess — he’s one of the sport’s best hitters and also a dominant pitcher. But people also note his character, pointing to his unpretentious and friendly behavior in the dugout. There’s a sense that he always remembers his Japanese roots, speaking in Japanese in interviews and addressing his fans. His wife, former professional basketball player Mamiko, as well as their dog, Decoy, routinely make headlines. Their daughter, born earlier this year, is already big news, starting with Ohtani’s announcement of the birth on Instagram, complete with a photo of her tiny feet. Yamamoto stole the show in the World Series, though. He pitched a rare complete game in a Game 2 victory, then won Games 6 and 7 with gutsy, back-to-back performances that easily earned him Series MVP honors. Kowa Minami, a waiter at the Hub, the restaurant hosting the public viewing, said he can’t let it on which team he is cheering for. Some of the customers were clearly rooting for the Blue Jays. “But to be honest I like the Dodgers because they have Japanese players,” he said. The Dodgers have riveted many in Japan, including Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. During a meeting several days ago with U.S. President Donald Trump, she told reporters the game was on and so they watched a bit together. “The Dodgers are winning,” she said. ___ SNTV videographer Koji Ueda contributed to this report from Oshu, Japan. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/@yurikageyama"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/head-start-closed-snap-government-shutdown-64504360d4d668d268b6eb314e6cb47a","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:02:22+00:00","title":"Government Shutdown Triggers Widespread Closures of Head Start Centers, Leaving Vulnerable Families Without Child Care","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal government shutdown in early November 2025 has triggered widespread closures of Head Start centers across the U.S., particularly in rural and low-income areas, depriving thousands of children — many from homeless, foster care, or low-income families — of essential early education, meals, and therapy.

The closures mean Head Start students — who come from low-income households, are homeless or are in foster care — are missing out on preschool, where they are fed two meals a day and receive therapy vital to their development.

What questions do you have for them? A half-dozen Head Start programs never received grants that were anticipated in October, but there are now 140 programs that have not received their annual infusion of federal funding. All told, the programs have capacity to assist 65,000 preschoolers and expectant parents. Centers across the country serving at least 8,000 families were closed Monday, according to the National Head Start Association. Every Head Start center in Little Rock, Arkansas, closed, as well as several rural programs in Ohio, Iowa and Florida. Head Start programs that serve the children of farmworkers who move seasonally were hit especially hard. More than 1,100 children in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama and Oklahoma were shut out of centers run by the East Coast Migrant Head Start Project, said CEO Javier Gonzalez. About 900 staff members across the centers also have been furloughed. Without care, some parents may keep an older sibling home from school to babysit. Others may resort to bringing their young child to the fields where they work, Gonzalez said. Pause in food aid compounds struggles for Head Start families Many of the families that qualify for the federal preschool program also depend on food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , better known as SNAP or food stamps. That program also was on track to run dry of money due to the shutdown, although a pair of federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to keep the program running with emergency reserve funds. That means many Head Start families have been worried about food aid , along with the child care they rely on to make ends meet. A day without child care means a day without work for many parents — and a day without pay. Having his 10-month-old daughter Maxxy in Early Head Start in Clinton, Iowa, opened up a new chapter for Jaxson Liebfreude, who had stayed at home since Maxxy was born while his spouse worked as a Burger King manager. The 22-year-old had started applying for jobs, but when he learned the Head Start was closing Monday, it meant putting his job aspirations on hold. “It’s stressful, because I really wanted to get back into working for a long time,” Liebfreude said. “But now it feels like I don’t even have the option anymore.” The family was already dealing with uncertainty because of the then-looming cuts in funding for SNAP, which they rely on for their groceries. Before the shutdown, Liebfreude said his family would visit one food pantry in their town monthly. Now, they go to all three food pantries once a month, in addition to asking friends to pick up food from the pantries to make sure they have enough for Maxxy, he said. “Only having to focus on giving her dinner and snacks after school was so much easier than having to make sure that we have enough food for her to have breakfast, lunch and dinner and more snacks,” Liebfreude said of Head Start’s meal service, which provides breakfast and lunch to enrolled children. Some centers stay open — for now Launched six decades ago as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty, Head Start programs provide a range of services beyond early education, such as medical and dental screenings, school meals and family support to children from low-income households who can’t afford other child care options. The initiative is funded almost entirely by the federal government, leaving it with little cushion from funding disruptions. Some that have missed out on grant payments have managed to remain open, with philanthropies, school districts and local governments filling in gaps. Others are relying on fast-dwindling reserves and warn they can’t keep their doors open for much longer. “If the government doesn’t open back up, we will be providing less services each week,” said Rekah Strong, who heads a social services nonprofit that runs Head Start centers in southern Washington state. She’s already had to close one center and several classrooms and cut back home-based visiting services. “It feels more bleak every day.” In Florida, Head Start centers in Tallahassee and surrounding Leon County closed Oct. 27, but then reopened the next day thanks to a grant from Children’s Services Council of Leon County. The local school district and churches have stepped up to provide meals for the children. “It takes a village to raise a child, and our village has come together,” said Nina Self, interim CEO of Capital Area Community Action Agency. But children in rural Jefferson and Franklin counties, where the agency runs two small Head Start centers, were not as lucky. They’ve been closed since late October. ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

Detroit in September for a possible Halloween attack, authorities said Monday in filing terrorism-related charges. Mohmed Ali, Majed Mahmoud and co-conspirators were inspired by the Islamic State group’s extremism, according to a 72-page criminal complaint unsealed in federal court. Investigators say a minor, identified only as Person 1, was deeply involved in the discussions. “Our American heroes prevented a terror attack,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X. The men, described as too young to drink alcohol, had looked at LGBTQ+ bars in Ferndale for a possible attack, according to the complaint. Before making arrests Friday, FBI agents had surveilled them for weeks, even using a camera on a pole outside a Dearborn house, according to the court filing. Investigators also got access to encrypted chats and other conversations and scoured social media posts. The FBI said it became interested in Ali, Mahmoud and the third person while investigating another man and picking up information on a group call in July that was recorded by a confidential source.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Defense attorneys William Swor and Amir Makled declined to comment. Makled over the weekend seemed to wave off the allegations , saying they were the result of “hysteria” and “fear-mongering.” Mahmoud had recently bought more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition that could be used for AR-15-style rifles, and both practiced at gun ranges, the government alleged. The FBI said the men repeatedly referred to “pumpkins” in their conversations, a reference to a Halloween attack. The court filing says Person 1, the minor, regularly consulted the father of a “local Islamic extremist ideologue” about when to commit a “good deed.” FBI Director Kash Patel had announced arrests Friday, but no details were released at the time while agents searched homes in Dearborn and a storage unit rented by Ali in nearby Inkster. The searches turned up tactical vests and backpacks, AR-15-style rifles, ammunition, loaded handguns and GoPro cameras, the FBI said. The criminal complaint doesn’t specifically say why Ferndale was a target, though the man who attacked the LGBTQ+-friendly Pulse Nightclub, killing 49 people in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group. Ferndale, which is just north of Detroit, attracts tens of thousands of people to its annual Pride parade. Former Mayor Dave Coulter, who is gay, said it was “disturbing” to hear about the alleged plot. Coulter, who’s now the elected Oakland County executive, said the pain of the Pulse Nightclub tragedy “is still deeply felt” in Ferndale. It’s the second case since May involving alleged plots in the Detroit area on behalf of the Islamic State group. The FBI said it arrested a man who had spent months planning an attack against a U.S. Army site in Warren.

Chow Hang-tung, a former leader of the group that organized a decades-old vigil to remember China’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, was charged in 2021 with inciting subversion, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. She was charged together with two of the group’s other former leaders, Albert Ho and Lee Cheuk-yan. Their case was brought under a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 to quell massive anti-government protests in 2019. The trio were accused of inciting others to challenge the leadership of the Communist Party by unlawful means. Chow, who is a barrister and is defending herself, argued that the indictment was unacceptably broad and vague because authorities did not specify an unlawful means. She said it could amount to a “catch-all charge.” Judge Alex Lee remarked during the hearing that the charge was broad, but not vague. Related Stories The week golf in America goes quiet.

The three-judge panel, approved by the government to oversee the case, ruled against Chow. Lee said the panel would issue an opinion in January. Chow appeared calm when she learned about the decision and smiled to the public gallery before leaving the courtroom. The Tiananmen vigil, organized by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, was the only large-scale public commemoration of the 1989 crackdown in China for decades until authorities banned it in 2020, citing anti-pandemic measures. The group came under increasing pressure as police opened an investigation , accusing it of being a foreign agent. The group rejected the allegations and refused to cooperate . Chow, Ho and Lee were later charged for violations of the National Security Law. In 2021, the alliance’s members voted to disband . Chow and two other core members of the group were convicted in 2023 for failing to provide authorities with information and received a sentence of 4 1/2 months each. But in March, the trio overturned their convictions at the city’s top court, marking a rare court victory for the city’s pro-democracy activists. A trial in the national security case is set for Jan. 22. Since pandemic-era gathering restrictions were lifted, the park where the vigil was previously held has been occupied on the Tiananmen anniversary by a carnival showcasing Chinese food and products. Fernando Cheung, spokesperson for Amnesty International Hong Kong Overseas, said the court’s decision on Monday showed that the authorities were “weaponizing the overly broad concept of ‘national security’ to suppress freedom of expression with impunity.” “Commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown should never have been prosecuted,” he said, calling for the release of those detained for what he called peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression. The Hong Kong government insists that the city’s security law restored the city’s stability after the 2019 protests. ____ This version has been updated to correct the maximum penalty to 10 years, instead of life imprisonment."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/hurricane-melissa-now-category-3-threatens-heavy-floods-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:51:09+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa, now Category 4, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, now a Category 4 storm with potential for intensification to Category 5, is threatening Jamaica and southern Haiti with catastrophic flooding, landslides, and deadly rainfall.

major Category 4 with potentially catastrophic consequences, as it dropped torrential rain in the northern Caribbean and threatened disastrous flooding and landslides in Jamaica and southern Haiti.\n\nMelissa could intensify to a Category 5 as it nears Jamaica, forecasters said on Sunday, when making landfall in the Caribbean island in the coming day or two.\n\n“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”\n\nMelissa was centred about 200km (125 miles) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about  455km (280 miles) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, late Saturday night.\n\nIt had maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour (115 miles per hour), the hurricane centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.\n\nIn Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.\n\n“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.\n\nThe storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.\n\nThe Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/jamaica-braces-as-hurricane-melissa-strengthens-offshore","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"06:45:50+00:00","title":"Officials warn Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm moving slowly at just 7km/h, is projected to make landfall in southwestern Jamaica, bringing extreme rainfall, tropical storm-force winds, and a high risk of flash flooding and landslides.

Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica\n\nPeople in Jamaica have been urged to take shelter as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41Z","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/death-toll-from-hurricane-melissa-climbs-to-49-with-many-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:15:49+00:00","title":"Death toll from Hurricane Melissa climbs to 49, with many still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, made landfall in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane, causing catastrophic damage, with at least 49 deaths reported across the Caribbean.

the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/melissa-leaves-50-dead-toll-expected-to-rise-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:03:28+00:00","title":"Melissa leaves 50 dead, toll expected to rise in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, devastated Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba, killing about 50 people with the death toll expected to rise.

Tuesday as a Category 5 storm, and residents were assessing their losses and the long road to recovery on Friday.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Jamaica remains without power, and nearly half of its water

a report issued by NGOs.\n\nDespite global efforts to phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/are-we-closer-to-a-gaza-international-peace-force-after-istanbul-meeting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:14:01+00:00","title":"Are we closer to a Gaza international peace force after Istanbul meeting?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Foreign ministers from seven Arab and Islamic-majority countries, including Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Pakistan, and Indonesia, met in Istanbul on November 3, 2025, to discuss the establishment of an international stabilisation force in Gaza to enforce the ceasefire that began on October 10.

2025-11-03T19:14:01+00:00\n\nTitle: Are we closer to a Gaza international peace force after Istanbul meeting?\n\nForeign ministers from seven Arab and Islamic-majority countries  have met in Turkiye’s largest city Istanbul  to discuss the possibility of establishing an international stabilisation force in Gaza, as well as the ceasefire in the territory.\n\nOne of the aims of the meeting on Monday was to get the countries closer to establishing the force, which would help maintain the ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave, which has been on rocky ground since it came into effect on October 10.\n\nIn that time, Israel has repeatedly violated the ceasefire, including last week when it launched another round of deadly attacks, killing more than 100 people – including 46 children – before “ resuming ” the ceasefire. In total,  at least 236 Palestinians  have been killed by Israel in Gaza since the ceasefire began.\n\nForeign ministers from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, and Indonesia attended the meeting alongside their Turkish counterpart. Some of them may contribute troops to a stablisation force.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan addressed reporters after the meeting, and said that conversations were still ongoing over the proposed international force for Gaza, which was included in United States President Donald Trump’s  20-point Gaza peace plan .\n\nThe body, which is expected to manage security inside the Gaza Strip, is still unformed and its responsibilities have still not been publicly defined.\n\nFidan said that the countries attending the meeting would “decide, based on the contents of this definition, whether to send soldiers or not”.\n\nSeveral countries involved in Monday’s meeting have previously called for a United Nations Security Council resolution establishing the force if they are to be involved. And the potential members of the force want its mandate to be clearly defined.\n\nThey had previously had what Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described as a  “fruitful” meeting on the topic  with Trump in late September.\n\nThere is still a fundamental lack of trust between the Arab and Islamic countries involved and Israel. This is largely a result of Israel’s actions since the ceasefire began, and its continued attacks on Gaza.\n\nUntil now, Israel has largely failed to meet its end of the ceasefire deal. In addition to those killed, hundreds more have been wounded. Israel is also not allowing Palestinians in Gaza to rebuild their homes, or permitting the agreed-upon number of  aid trucks  to enter the besieged enclave.\n\nFor its part, Israel claims Hamas has not returned the bodies of dead captives quickly enough. Hamas, however, says the work is complicated because of the huge amount of rubble created by Israeli attacks and because Israel destroyed most of the heavy equipment that is needed to search for bodies during its war on Gaza. Hamas also points out that, since the ceasefire began, Israel has blocked new machinery from entering the Strip.\n\nFidan said that Israel was making excuses to try and end the ceasefire and that the Israelis are not meeting their obligations under the agreement, adding that this was the joint viewpoint of the meeting’s attendees.\n\nHe also called on Israel to stop its regular ceasefire violations and to allow access to humanitarian aid in Gaza – another topic that was discussed at the meeting.\n\nThe proposed stabilisation force members are essentially worried that they are being asked to send troops to Gaza when it is not certain that Israel is fully committed to the ceasefire. The international forces’ soldiers would therefore be in a situation where they are at risk of being attacked, and policing on the ground while Israel continues to bomb.\n\nFidan said that there are still major differences between Hamas and Israel that may not be resolvable in the short term, but that Turkiye is working towards peace.\n\nErdogan has been highly critical of Israel’s numerous violations of the ceasefire.\n\n“We all see that Israel’s record on this matter is very poor,” Turkiye’s president said in remarks picked up by Turkish state news agency Anadolu.\n\n“We are facing an administration that has massacred over 200 innocent people since the ceasefire agreement and continues its occupation and attacks on the West Bank,” Erdogan added.\n\n“We cannot allow the annexation of the [occupied] West Bank, the changing of Jerusalem’s status, or attempts to damage the sanctity of the Al-Aqsa Mosque.”\n\nTurkiye has a long history of relations with Israel – it was the first Muslim-majority state to recognise it in 1949.\n\nBut ties between the two countries hit an all-time low as a result of the war on Gaza, in which Israel has killed nearly 69,000 Palestinians.\n\nErdogan has heavily criticised Israel’s actions during the war, while some analysts believe Israel may be  trying to build support  for a future attack on Turkiye.\n\nTurkiye has been crucial in ceasefire negotiations by encouraging Hamas to accept Trump’s peace plan.\n\nIt has also offered to take part in the international force for Gaza, but Israeli officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Gideon Saar – are adamant that their country won’t accept a Turkish presence in Gaza."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-2025-5e19f170cfd40f91d1c6f55a7244662e","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:32:49Z","title":"Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade 2025: K-pop, Music Stars and Global Media Take Center Stage","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade features a diverse lineup of musical artists, including Ciara, Lil Jon, Kool & the Gang, and K-pop group HUNTR/X, with their film's soundtrack reaching No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and going platinum.

Teyana Taylor will feature in this year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, which will also cement “KPop Demon Hunters” as a pop culture phenomenon with appearances by the movie’s singers on the ground and cute characters in balloons overhead. An eclectic group of stars — from ballet dancer Tiler Peck to YouTube’s “Hot Ones” host Sean Evans — will join the annual holiday kick-off, highlighted by Audrey Nuna, EJAE and Rei Ami of HUNTR/X, the fictional girl group at the heart of the Netflix K-pop hit. The trio are behind the film’s soundtrack, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and recently went platinum. Two characters from the movie — Derpy Tiger and Sussie — will join the parade lineup as a mid-sized balloon and the adorably named balloonicle. The parade will begin at 8:30 a.m. on Nov. 27 in all time zones and will feature 32 balloons, three ballonicles, 27 floats, 33 clown groups and 11 marching bands — all leading the way for Santa Claus. The familiar TV hosts — Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker from the “Today” show — will return on NBC and Peacock. More stars will be announced later. Broadway, Buzz Lightyear and Debbie Gibson Broadway will be represented by cast members from “Buena Vista Social Club,” “Just in Time” and “Ragtime,” while the Radio City Rockettes will be there and some serious athletes — three-time U.S. national champion figure skater Ilia Malinin and U.S Paralympian Jack Wallace. Every year, spectators line-up a half-dozen deep along the route to cheer the floats, entertainers and marching bands. Last year, more than 31 million people tuned in on NBC and Peacock, up 10% from the previous year and marking the biggest audience ever for the parade. This year, four new featured character balloons will debut, including Buzz Lightyear, Pac-Man, Mario from Super Mario Brothers and a 32-foot-tall (9.8-meter) balloon onion carriage featuring eight characters from the world of “Shrek.” Ahead of next year’s 100th anniversary of the parade, organizers are also including balloons from previous marches, including Rainbow trout, the Happy Hippo Triple Stack, Wigglefoot and Freida the Dachshund. Six new floats will also debut this year, including from Holland America Line, Lego, Lindt chocolates, “Stranger Things” and a bunch of whimsical sheep trying to get to sleep courtesy of Serta. Some of the stars on hand will be Jewel, Debbie Gibson, Drew Baldridge, Matteo Bocelli, Colbie Caillat, Gavin DeGraw, Meg Donnelly, Christopher Jackson, Darlene Love, Roman Mejia, Taylor Momsen, Calum Scott, Shaggy, Lauren Spencer Smith and Luísa Sonza. The marching bands will hail from South Carolina, California, Texas, Arizona, New Hampshire, Mississippi, Alabama, Pennsylvania and Santiago, Panama. The New York Police Department’s marching band will also join."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/israel-arrests-ex-army-lawyer-over-leaked-video-showing-palestinians-abuse","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:13:40Z","title":"Israel arrests ex-army lawyer over leaked video showing Palestinian’s abuse","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A former Israeli military prosecutor, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, was arrested after leaking a video allegedly showing Palestinian detainees being abused at the Sde Teiman military base in July 2024.

arrested a former military prosecutor after she leaked a video appearing to show soldiers abusing a Palestinian detainee.\n\nMajor General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was detained overnight on Monday, according to the country’s national security minister, following a scandal that erupted after she leaked a video, resigned and then disappeared.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the leaking of the video perhaps the most “severe public relations attack” on Israel since its founding.\n\nReporting from Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh said the arrest of Tomer-Yerushalmi has created “a political and legal storm in Israel”, noting the spotlight on the leaker has overshadowed attention to the original crime.\n\n“There is so much focus on the fact that this video was leaked, at the expense of discussing how this crime actually happened – and the fact that the UN says that these kinds of crimes are being committed in a systematic manner,” Odeh said.\n\n“In one way, it’s a way to shift attention from the fact that these crimes are happening, by focusing on this woman and the fact that she leaked the video.”\n\nIsrael’s torture and abuse of Palestinian detainees has been reported for years. But they have increased since Israel’s latest war on Gaza, with some Israeli politicians even defending the practice.\n\nAt least 75 Palestinian detainees have died in Israeli jails since October 7, 2023, according to the United Nations.\n\nEven the remains of Palestinians returned by Israel show signs of  torture  with many having marks on their bodies, or blindfolds and handcuffs still on some of them. Some of the bodies had missing limbs or teeth, while some appeared to have been burned, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza has said .\n\nTomer-Yerushalmi disappeared for several hours on Sunday after she announced her resignation, sparking speculation of a possible suicide attempt.\n\nAccording to a copy of her resignation letter published by Israeli media on Friday, Tomer-Yerushalmi acknowledged that her office had released the video to the media last year. Five reservists were later charged with mistreating prisoners.\n\nNational Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said on Monday on Telegram: “It was agreed that in light of last night’s events, the prison service would act with extra vigilance to ensure the detainee’s safety in the detention centre where she has been placed in custody.”\n\nThe statement did not indicate what charges she faced.\n\nAccording to Israeli media, a Tel Aviv court ordered Tomer-Yerushalmi’s remand in custody until noon on Wednesday.\n\nPublic broadcaster Kan reported that she was suspected of “fraud and breach of trust, abuse of office, obstruction of justice and disclosure of information by a public servant”.\n\nFormer chief military prosecutor Colonel Matan Solomesh was also arrested overnight in connection with the case and was appearing in court Monday, reported Israeli Army Radio.\n\nOn Friday, the Israeli military announced that Tomer-Yerushalmi had resigned from her post pending an investigation into leaked footage taken at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel last year.\n\nThe case began in August 2024 when Israel’s Channel 12 broadcast footage from Sde Teiman, which has been used to hold Palestinians taken during the war in Gaza.\n\nThe surveillance camera footage indicated that soldiers had committed illicit acts, without explicitly showing it, as it appeared to take place behind troops holding up shields.\n\nThe video was picked up by several media outlets, triggering international outrage and protests within Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military said in February that it had filed charges against five reservist soldiers connected with mistreatment at Sde Teiman.\n\nThey were charged with “acting against the detainee with severe violence, including stabbing the detainee’s bottom with a sharp object, which had penetrated near the detainee’s rectum”.\n\nIt added “the acts of violence have caused severe physical injury to the detainee, including cracked ribs, a punctured lung and an inner rectal tear”.\n\nThe indictment said that the abuse took place on July 5, 2024 during a search of the detainee.\n\nSpeaking after a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu blasted the leak of the video, labelling it as perhaps the most “severe public relations attack” on Israel in the country’s history."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/guinea-military-government-leader-enters-presidential-race","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"22:06:50Z","title":"Guinea military government leader enters presidential race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mamady Doumbouya, the leader of Guinea’s military government, has officially entered the presidential race for the December 28 election, violating his earlier promise not to run.

leader enters presidential race\n\nGuinea’s military government leader, Mamady Doumbouya, has officially entered the presidential race, submitting his candidacy for the December 28 elections, aimed at restoring constitutional order following the general’s 2021 coup.\n\nDoumbouya arrived at the West African country’s Supreme Court in an armoured vehicle on Monday to formally hand in his candidacy, surrounded by special forces. He left without giving a statement.\n\nThousands of his supporters, who had travelled to the capital, Conakry, by bus, gathered outside the court, chanting: “Mamady champion, Mamady president, Mamady already elected!”\n\nDoumbouya, 40, had promised not to run when he seized power in 2021. But a new constitution pushed by the military government and approved in a  referendum in September  opened the door to his candidacy.\n\nThe new charter replaced arrangements agreed to after the coup, which had barred members of the military government from contesting elections. It also requires presidential candidates to live in Guinea and be between 40 and 80 years old.\n\nThis would bar two potentially powerful candidates – former President Alpha Conde, 87, the country’s first freely-elected president, who lives abroad, and former Prime Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo, 73, who is in exile over corruption allegations that he denies.\n\nOther candidates, including former Prime Minister Lansana Kouyate and former Foreign Minister Hadja Makale Camara, have submitted their applications and would be able to stand.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the opposition Living Forces of Guinea (FVG) alliance condemned Doumbouya’s candidacy as “a disastrous turning point in our country’s history” and accused him of trampling on “the solemn commitments” he made not to run for president.\n\nImpoverished Guinea, a former French colony that is home to 14.5 million people, has long been blighted by coups and violence from hardline governments.\n\nHowever, it experienced a period of democratic transition following the November 2010 election of Conde, until he was overthrown by Doumbouya in September 2021.\n\nSince coming to power, Doumbouya has significantly  restricted freedoms .\n\nThe military government has banned demonstrations and has arrested, prosecuted or pushed into exile several opposition leaders, some of whom were victims of forced disappearances.\n\nSeveral media outlets have also been suspended and journalists arrested.\n\nGuinea became the second country in sub-Saharan Africa after Ghana to gain independence in 1958, before the decolonisation wave of the 1960s. It is home to the world’s largest bauxite reserves and the world’s richest untapped iron ore deposit at Simandou."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-caused-amazons-aws-outage-and-why-did-so-many-major-apps-go-offline","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:23:04+00:00","title":"What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) began at 07:11 GMT, originating from a technical error in a software update to DynamoDB’s API in AWS’s Virginia data center.

2025-10-21T02:23:04+00:00\n\nTitle: What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/trump-administration-to-partially-fund-snap-food-benefits-amid-us-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:41:29+00:00","title":"Trump administration to partially fund SNAP food benefits amid US shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a government shutdown, federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled that suspending the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was unlawful and caused irreparable harm, compelling the Trump administration to partially fund the program using approximately $5 billion in contingency funds.

fund SNAP food benefits amid US shutdown\n\nThe United States government will partially fund food benefits for low-income Americans after two judges ruled the programme must continue amid a languishing  government shutdown , US President Donald Trump’s administration has said.\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – the country’s flagship food aid scheme, serving one in eight Americans each month – was set to freeze on November 1, after the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)  said on October 10  that it would not be able to fund the programme if the shutdown continued.\n\nOn Friday, federal judges in the states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island  doled out separate but similar rulings  that told the federal government to cover the benefits by drawing from contingency funds.\n\nSNAP, known colloquially as food stamps, costs more than $8bn to deploy monthly and covers about $190 or $356 in groceries per household. The benefits are typically loaded onto debit cards.\n\nIn a filing on Monday to the Rhode Island court, the USDA agreed to “fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today”.\n\nThe administration will use up a fund totalling about $5bn, but not other funds that would allow it to fully fund SNAP, the filing said.\n\nBecause the process of loading the cards can take up to two weeks, it’s not yet clear when beneficiaries may begin to receive funds again – nor how much money will ultimately be included.\n\nThe judges had given the Trump administration until Monday to address how it could partially fund SNAP, with US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruling a suspension of the programme was “unlawful” and “erroneous”.\n\n“This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program,” she added.\n\nIn Rhode Island, US District Judge John McConnell reached a similar conclusion and asked the administration for an update on Monday, saying in a virtual hearing that “it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur” if SNAP is paused.\n\nThe rulings came in response to separate challenges to the Trump administration’s suspension of benefits.\n\nTrump had initially claimed on his Truth Social platform on Friday that the judges’ decisions were “conflicting”, and he used the potential loss of SNAP to take a shot at “Radical Democrats”.\n\nRight-wing disinformation about food stamps has meanwhile surfaced online in recent days, with  one viral chart claiming  that “Afghan”, “Somali” and “Iraqi” people were the biggest beneficiaries of SNAP.\n\nIn fact, USDA data show that white people use SNAP the most, accounting for more than 35 percent of beneficiaries."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/israel-releases-five-palestinian-prisoners-as-killings-continue-in-gaza","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:12:21Z","title":"Israel releases five Palestinian prisoners as killings continue in Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has released five Palestinian prisoners as part of a fragile ceasefire agreement with Hamas, which began on October 10, 2025.

.\n\nThe five men, freed on Monday evening, were taken to Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah for medical examinations, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary reported from outside the facility.\n\nRelatives gathered at the hospital, some embracing the freed prisoners, while others anxiously sought information about missing family members.\n\n“This is the first time since the ceasefire that Israeli forces have released unknown Palestinian prisoners,” said Khoudary.\n\nThousands of Palestinians remain  imprisoned  in Israel, many held without charge under what rights groups call arbitrary detention.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Gaza’s Health Ministry said it received the remains of 45 Palestinians from Israel through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), bringing the total number of bodies handed over under the ceasefire agreement to 270.\n\nForensic teams have identified 78 bodies so far and will continue their examinations “in accordance with approved medical procedures and protocols” before returning the remains to families, the ministry said in a statement on Monday.\n\nOfficials previously reported that many of the returned bodies bore  evidence  of torture and abuse, including bound hands, blindfolds, and facial disfigurement, and were handed back without identification tags.\n\nThe handover forms part of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement that took effect on October 10, which includes prisoner and body exchanges mediated by Turkiye, Egypt, and Qatar, with involvement from the United States.\n\nReporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Khoudary said, “Many of the bodies returned show signs of  torture .” She added that families of missing Palestinians are still searching for relatives among the dead.\n\n“If these bodies are not identified, they will be buried along with other Palestinians in a mass grave in Deir el-Balah,” she said.\n\nDespite a ceasefire, Israel continues to carry out deadly attacks. A source at Nasser Medical Complex told Al Jazeera Arabic that three Palestinians were killed on Monday by Israeli fire north of Rafah in southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli army said it launched strikes on southern Gaza, claiming individuals had crossed the “yellow line”, an Israeli-controlled area, in what it called a ceasefire violation.\n\nThe Israeli version of events could not be independently verified. It also remains unclear whether the Israeli military was referring to the same attack that killed the three Palestinians.\n\nIn Gaza City, a child was among three people wounded by Israeli fire in the city’s east, a source at al-Ahli Arab Hospital told Al Jazeera.\n\nReporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said Israel continues to use quadcopter drones to drop grenades on buildings left partially standing. “Authorities here describe these acts as violations of the ceasefire,” he said.\n\nThe Gaza Government Media Office has accused Israel of committing more than 125 ceasefire violations since the truce took effect, warning that continued attacks threaten to reignite full-scale hostilities."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/thousands-evacuated-as-typhoon-kalmaegi-approaches-the-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:20:14+00:00","title":"Thousands evacuated as Typhoon Kalmaegi approaches the Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi is approaching the eastern Philippines, prompting emergency evacuations of over 70,000 people in coastal towns like Guiuan, Salcedo, and Mercedes.

Philippines before Typhoon Kalmaegi’s expected landfall.\n\nForecasters have warned of torrential rains, storm surges of up to 3 metres (10ft) and wind gusts of up to 150km/h (93mph) as the centre of the storm was expected to come ashore on Monday.\n\nMore than 70,000 people in the coastal towns of Guiuan and Salcedo on Samar Island and Mercedes in Camarines Norte province were ordered to move to

It was badly hit in November 2013 when one of the most powerful tropical cyclones on record smashed into the Philippines. The storm left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and displaced over four million people.\n\nKalmaegi is forecast to travel westwards overnight before hitting central island provinces on Tuesday.

devastation of Hurricane Melissa as dozens of deaths are reported in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.\n\nThe hurricane – at Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067291","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067270","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24Z","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' discusses a major storm event, but due to the lack of actual content, no specific details or named entities can be extracted.

Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/trump-says-he-will-restrict-federal-funds-for-new-york-city-if-mamdani-wins","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"23:25:19Z","title":"Trump endorses Cuomo, threatens to cut funds for NYC if Mamdani wins","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the highly anticipated 2025 New York City mayoral election, former U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed Andrew Cuomo, the former governor running as an independent, and issued a stark warning that he would cut federal funds if Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist and first Muslim, first African-born, and first South Asian descent leader, wins.

Donald Trump has urged his supporters to vote for former Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York City’s mayoral race and threatened to restrict federal funds for the metropolis if Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the election.\n\nThe formal endorsement on Monday came hours before polling stations were set to open in the pivotal election.\n\nPolls show Mamdani leading against Cuomo, the former governor of New York State who is running as an independent after losing to the young politician in the Democratic primary.\n\nAccording to the latest RealClearPolitics polls on Monday, Mamdani led with 45.8 percent, maintaining a 14.7-point advantage over Cuomo’s 31.1 percent.\n\nThe Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa, was at 17.3 percent.\n\nTrump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, said “it is my strong conviction that New York City will be a Complete and Total Economic and Social Disaster should Mamdani win”.\n\nThe Republican president said he would rather see Cuomo, a “Democrat, who has had a Record of Success, WIN, than a Communist with no experience and a Record of COMPLETE AND TOTAL FAILURE”.\n\nHe went on to say that a vote for the Republican candidate, Sliwa, was a “vote for Mamdani”.\n\n“Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!”\n\nTrump went on to say that if Mamdani wins the race, “it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required”.\n\nThe US president’s statement came as the mayoral candidates raced across New York City’s five boroughs after months of back-and-forth barbs,  social media hits  and  saucy debates.\n\nMamdani led a sunrise walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, flanked by hundreds of supporters, before kicking off the day with a speech at City Hall. Cuomo, on his part, denounced socialism in the Bronx, visited seniors in Chinatown, and popped off an X  post  calling Mamdani a “poser”.\n\nSliwa greeted supporters in the Coney Island neighbourhood of Brooklyn in his signature red hat, as he spoke at a subway station where a woman was killed on a train last year.\n\nThe mayoral race, which has captured outsized global attention, has seen a record 735,317  early votes cast  over the past nine days, more than four times the total for the 2021 election, according to the New York City Board of Elections.\n\nMamdani, a 34-year-old New York state assemblyman, has  galvanised New Yorkers  with an optimistic, multilingual campaign that promised free buses, rent freezes and universal childcare, partially paid for by taxing the city’s wealthiest residents.\n\nIf elected, the assemblyman would be the first Muslim, first person born in Africa and the first person of South Asian descent to lead New York City.\n\nMamdani on Monday reiterated that Trump had  signalled his support for Cuomo  in a 60 Minutes interview and warned of dark days if the former governor is elected.\n\n“If [Cuomo is] elected as mayor, our city will descend deeper into the darkness that has forced too many of our neighbours to flee, and made it impossible for working people to live lives of dignity,” Mamdani said.\n\nIn his City Hall speech on Monday, Mamdani seemed to embrace the  seismic shift  that his campaign has represented for New York’s politics.\n\n“There were few in this city who dared to imagine that we could win, and what it would mean for a city that has – for too long – served only the wealthy and powerful, at the expense of those who work through sunrises and sunsets,” Mamdani said.\n\nMoments later, the crowd broke out in cheers of, “Our time is now!”\n\nCuomo, who  resigned as governor  in 2021 after an independent state probe found he had engaged in a pattern of sexually harassing women, has meanwhile  appealed to conservatives  as a way to up his polling numbers.\n\nIn his final hours of campaigning, he took aim at Mamdani’s democratic socialist promises, likening them to left-wing governments in Latin America.\n\n“Socialism didn’t work in Venezuela. Socialism didn’t work in Cuba. Socialism is not going to work in New York City,” Cuomo said. Mamdani, however, is a self-described “democratic socialist”.\n\nNew York’s most prominent billionaires, including hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, have supported Cuomo’s campaign, with Ackman doling out a total of $750,000 through donation vehicles known as super PACs, CNBC reported last week."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a major advancement in its space programme.

Peruvian prime minister who is on trial over an alleged coup attempt in 2022.\n\nThe announcement on Monday came hours after former Prime Minister Betssy Chavez – who served under former President Pedro Castillo – fled to the Mexican Embassy in Peru.\n\n“Today we learned with surprise and deep regret that Betssy Chavez, the alleged co-author of the coup attempt by former President Pedro Castillo, is being granted asylum at the Mexican Embassy residence in Peru,” Minister of Foreign Affairs Hugo de Zela told a news conference.\n\n“Given this unfriendly act, and considering the repeated instances in which the current and former presidents of that country have interfered in Peru’s internal affairs, the Peruvian government has decided to sever diplomatic relations with Mexico today,” he added.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Mexico.\n\nChavez’s lawyer, Raul Noblecilla, told local radio station RPP that he had not heard from his client in several days and was unaware of whether she had requested asylum.\n\nChavez, who served in Castillo’s cabinet as Minister of Culture, was appointed as prime minister in November 2022 amid a months-long standoff between the president and the Congress.\n\nCastillo – a former rural schoolteacher and trade unionist, dubbed Peru’s “first poor president” – was impeached by lawmakers the following month when he attempted to dissolve the Congress.\n\nRelations between Lima and Mexico deteriorated sharply afterwards.\n\nFollowing his impeachment, Castillo was on his way to the Mexican embassy in Lima to request asylum when he was arrested and charged with rebellion and abuse of authority.\n\nChavez was charged alongside him.\n\nIn December 2022, Peru expelled Mexico’s ambassador after Mexico granted asylum to Castillo’s wife and children.\n\nCastillo’s successor, then-President Dina Boluarte, also temporarily recalled Peru’s ambassador to Mexico City in February 2023, accusing then-left-wing president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of meddling in her country’s affairs for expressing support for Castillo.\n\nThe former president and Chavez went on trial in March of this year.\n\nWhile Castillo has been in preventive custody since his impeachment, Chavez was released on bail in September.\n\nProsecutors had sought a 25-year term for Chavez for allegedly participating in Castillo’s plan to dissolve Congress.\n\nThey have sought a 34-year sentence for Castillo.\n\nThe pair has denied the charges."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/ukraine-receives-patriot-systems-to-bolster-air-defences-against-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"16:22:37+00:00","title":"Ukraine

are showing in the Mamdani vs Cuomo NYC mayoral race\n\nNew York City’s mayoral race is entering its final stretch, with early voting now ended and residents among some five million registered voters set to cast their ballots on November 4 to choose the  city ’s next leader.\n\nAccording to the New York City Board of Elections, 734,317 early votes have been cast over the past nine days – more than quadruple the total for the 2021 mayoral elections.\n\nAccording to the latest RealClearPolitics average, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani leads with 45.8 percent, holding a 14.7-point advantage over independent Andrew Cuomo at 31.1 percent and a 28.5-point lead over Republican Curtis Sliwa at 17.3 percent.\n\nMamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), has  energised  liberal voters, drawn to his proposals for universal, free childcare, free buses, and a rent freeze for New Yorkers living in about one million rent-regulated apartments.\n\nNew York City holds mayoral elections every four years, with a two-term limit for any individual. The current mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, who has been in office since January 2022, withdrew his candidacy earlier in the year following several controversies, most notably his federal criminal indictment on bribery and conspiracy charges, which was ultimately dismissed by a judge in April.\n\nThis year’s contest is notable for its three-way dynamic, bringing progressive, establishment and conservative forces to face off in the country’s largest city.\n\nThe latest polls put Mamdani between three and 25 points ahead of Cuomo, according to a selection of polls from RealClearPolitics.\n\nEvery poll carries a degree of uncertainty. While pollsters aim to capture a representative sample and mirror the wider electorate, there are margins of error. As such, actual levels of support fall within a few points of reported figures, with each surveyor using differing wording in issues such as how to treat undecided voters.\n\nAggregating different results helps to reduce bias.\n\nPolling organisations, such as Emerson College, Marist College, and Quinnipiac University, regularly conduct public opinion surveys to gauge voter sentiment leading up to the primaries and general election.\n\nSurveys use random sampling, including contacting voters by phone, text, or online, and ask respondents about their candidate preferences, key issues influencing their vote, and approval ratings.\n\nPoll results include margins of error and sample sizes, which aid in interpreting accuracy and the fidelity of findings.\n\nUnlike the primaries, which used ranked choice voting (RCV), the general election uses a first-past-the-post system, so whoever gets the most votes wins.\n\nAs of February, there were 5.1 million registered voters in New York City, of whom 65 percent were Democrats and 11 percent were Republicans. About 1.1 million voters were not registered with any party, and voter registration closed on October 25, one week before the November 4 election.\n\nIn the last New York City mayoral election, just more than 1.1 million voters cast ballots – about 21 percent of registered voters.\n\nTo be eligible to vote, residents of New York must:\n\nPolling stations will be open between 6am (11:00 GMT) and 9pm on November 4 (02:00 GMT on November 5).\n\nTimings vary from location to location in the city, but polling stations open between 8am and 10am and close between 4pm and 9pm.\n\nEarly voting began on October 25 and ended on November 2.\n\nA full list of polling stations open for early voting is available on the  website  of the New York City Board of Elections."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/key-takeaways-from-trumps-60-minutes-interview","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"15:25:36+00:00","title":"Key takeaways from Trump’s 60 Minutes interview","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent 60 Minutes interview with CBS host Norah O’Donnell, former President Donald Trump addressed a range of high-stakes issues, including the ongoing government shutdown, aggressive immigration enforcement, nuclear testing, and foreign policy stances on China, Taiwan, and Venezuela.

2025-11-03T15:25:36+00:00\n\nTitle: Key takeaways from Trump’s 60 Minutes interview\n\nUS President Donald Trump has appeared on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes just months after he won a $16m settlement from the broadcaster for alleged “deceptive editing”.\n\nIn the interview with CBS host Norah O’Donnell, which was filmed last Friday at his Mar-a-Lago residence and aired on Sunday, Trump touched on several topics, including the ongoing government shutdown, his administration’s unprecedented crackdowns on undocumented migrants, the US’s decision to restart nuclear testing, and the trade war with China.\n\nTrump, who regularly appears on Fox News, a right-wing media outlet, has an uneasy relationship with CBS, which is considered centrist.\n\nIn October 2020, the president walked out of a 60 Minutes interview in the lead-up to the 2020 election he lost, claiming that the host, Lesley Stahl, was “biased”.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the interview:\n\nThe president’s lawyers sued CBS owner Paramount in October 2024 for “mental anguish” over a pre-election interview with rival candidate Kamala Harris that Trump claimed had been deceptively edited to favour Democrats and thus affected his campaign.\n\nCBS had aired two different versions of an answer Harris gave to a question on Israel’s war on Gaza, posed by host Bill Whitaker. One version aired on 60 Minutes while the other appeared on the programme Face the Nation.\n\nAsked whether Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, listened to US advice, Harris answered: “We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States – to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.”\n\nIn an alternative edit, featured in earlier pre-broadcast promotions, Harris had given a longer, more rambling response that did not sound as concise.\n\nThe network argued the answer was edited differently for the two shows due to time restrictions, but Trump’s team claimed CBS “distorted” its broadcasts and “helped” Harris, thereby affecting his campaign. Trump asked for an initial $10bn in damages before upping it to $20bn in February 2025.\n\nParamount, in July 2025, chose to settle with Trump’s team to the tune of $16m in the form of a donation to a planned Trump presidential library. That move angered journalist unions and rights groups, which argued it set a bad precedent for press freedom.\n\nParamount executives said the company would not apologise for the editing of its programmes, but had decided to settle to put the matter to rest.\n\nThe company was at the time trying to secure federal approval from Trump’s government for a proposed merger with Skydance, owned by Trump ally Larry Ellison. The Federal Communications Commission has since approved the merger that gives Ellison’s Skydance controlling rights.\n\nOn October 19, Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, US special envoy to the Middle East, were interviewed on 60 Minutes regarding the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nAfter meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea  last Thursday, Trump praised his counterpart as a “strong man, a very powerful leader” and said their relationship was on an even keel despite the trade war. However, he blamed China for “ripping off” the US through its dominance of crucial rare earth materials.\n\nTrump told 60 Minutes he had cut a favourable trade agreement with China and that “we got – no rare-earth threat. That’s gone, completely gone”, referring to Chinese export restrictions on critical rare-earth metals needed to manufacture a wide range of items including defence equipment, smartphones and electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, Beijing actually only said it would delay introducing export controls for five rare-earth metals it announced in October, and did not mention restrictions on a further  seven it announced in April this year . Those restrictions remain in place.\n\nTrump said President Xi did not say anything about whether Beijing planned to attack autonomous Taiwan.\n\nHowever, he referred to past assurances from Xi, saying: “He [Xi] has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, ‘We would never do anything while President Trump is president’, because they know the consequences.”\n\nAsked whether he would order US forces to action if China moved  militarily on Taiwan,  Trump demurred, saying: “You’ll find out if it happens, and he understands the answer to that … I can’t give away my secrets. The other side knows.”\n\nThere are mounting fears in the US that China could attack Taiwan. Washington’s stance of “strategic ambiguity” has always kept observers speculating about whether the US would defend Taiwan against Beijing. Ahead of the last elections, Trump said Taiwan should “pay” for protection.\n\nWhen asked why he pardoned cryptocurrency multibillionaire and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao last month, Trump said: “I don’t know who he is.”\n\nThe president said he had never met Zhao, but had been told he was the victim of a “witch hunt” by the administration of former US President Joe Biden.\n\nZhao pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering in connection with child sex abuse and “terrorism” on his crypto platform in 2023. He served four months in prison until September 2024, and stepped down as chief executive of Binance.\n\nBinance has been  linked  to the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company World Liberty Financial, and many have questioned if the case is a conflict of interest.\n\nIn March 2025, World Liberty Financial launched its own dollar-pegged cryptocoin, USD1, on Binance’s blockchain and the company promoted it to its 275 million users. The coin was also supported by an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates, MGX Fund Management Limited, which used $2bn worth of the World Liberty stablecoin to buy a stake in Binance.\n\nThis part of the interview appeared in a full transcript of the 90-minute interview, but does not appear in either the 28-minute televised version or the 73-minute extended online video version. CBS said in a note on the YouTube version that it was “condensed for clarity”.\n\nTrump justified last week’s decision by his government to  resume nuclear testing  for the first time in 33 years, saying that other countries – besides North Korea – are already doing it.\n\n“Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it,” Trump said, also mentioning Pakistan. “You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are gonna report – they don’t have reporters that gonna be writing about it. We do.”\n\nRussia, China, and Pakistan have not openly conducted tests in recent years. Analyst Georgia Cole of UK think tank Chatham House told Al Jazeera that “there is no indication” the three countries have resumed testing.\n\nThe president claimed the US-negotiated ceasefire and peace plan between Israel and Hamas was “very solid” despite Israeli strikes  killing 236 Gazans  since the ceasefire went into effect. It is also unclear whether or when the Palestinian armed group, Hamas, has agreed it will disarm.\n\nHowever, Trump said he was not worried about Hamas disarming as the US would force the armed group to do so. “Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don’t behave,” he said.\n\nTrump denied the US was going to war with Venezuela despite a US military build-up off the country’s coast and  deadly air strikes  targeting alleged drug-trafficking ships in the country’s waters. The United Nations has said the strikes are a violation of international law.\n\nResponding to a question about whether the strikes were really about unseating Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro, Trump said they weren’t. However, when asked if Maduro’s days in office were numbered, the president answered: “I would say, yeah.”\n\nTrump, a member of the Republican Party, blamed Democrats for what is now close to the longest government shutdown in US history, which has been ongoing since October 1.\n\nSenators from the Democratic Party have refused to approve a new budget unless it extends expiring tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans and unless Trump reverses healthcare cuts made in his tax-and-spending bill, passed earlier this year.\n\nThe US president made it clear that he would not negotiate with Democrats, and did not give clear plans for ending the shutdown affecting 1.4 million governent employees.\n\nReferring to a US Supreme Court hearing brought by businesses arguing that the Trump government’s tariff war on other countries is illegal and has caused domestic inflation, Trump said the US “would go to hell” and be a “third world nation” if the court ordered tariffs to be removed.\n\nHe said the tariffs are necessary for “national security” and that they have increased respect from other countries for the US.\n\nTrump defended his government’s unprecedented Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  raids  and surveillance on people perceived to be undocumented migrants.\n\nWhen asked if the raids had gone too far, he responded: “No. I think they haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by [former US Presidents Joe] Biden and [Barack] Obama.”\n\nRegarding the New York City mayoral race scheduled for November 4, Trump said he would not back democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, and called him a “communist”. He said if Mamdani wins, it will be hard for him to “give a lot of money to New York”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"3133-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00+00:00","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article examines key developments in science and technology, including Amazon’s workforce cuts and AWS outage, China’s export ban on Nexperia products, climate change impacts in Iceland, Pakistan’s HPV vaccination rollout, AI-related misinformation concerns, and policy shifts in the US such as the elimination of EV tax incentives.

first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/new-light-shed-on-el-fasher-horror-as-survivors-arrive-in-sudans-tawila","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"16:49:45+00:00","title":"New light shed on el-Fasher horror as survivors arrive in Sudan’s Tawila","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the fall of el-Fasher to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on October 26, 2025, survivors report widespread atrocities including mass executions, sexual violence, and looting.

corpses, families separated by violence and survivors travelling for days without food or water. These are the accounts emerging from people who have fled the western Sudanese city of el-Fasher after it fell to paramilitary forces a week ago following an asphyxiating 18-month siege.\n\nFatima Yahya has arrived in Tawila, a town west of el-Fasher in Sudan’s North Darfur State that is controlled by a neutral force in the conflict. She was still traumatised from the three days she went hungry before finally escaping. Her husband and uncle are missing. The memories of what happened in el-Fasher were difficult for her to put into words.\n\n“The dead bodies were everywhere – in the streets, inside houses and at the gates of many houses,” Yahya told Al Jazeera. “Wherever you are in el-Fasher, you will see dead bodies scattered.”\n\nHer testimony is one of several accounts from people who fled North Darfur’s capital after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group fighting Sudan’s regular army, captured the city on  October 26 . The RSF’s takeover gave the group control of the last major city in Darfur to have been held by the Sudanese armed forces (SAF), solidifying its grip across the vast western region.\n\nSince the fall of el-Fasher, a city that was home to more than 1 million people before the war, reports have mounted of  mass executions , sexual violence and widespread looting.\n\nSatellite imagery  analysed  by Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab has identified at least 31 locations where objects consistent with human bodies have appeared since the city’s capture, accompanied by what researchers describe as reddish ground discolouration.\n\nFor those who fled, injuries from the initial fighting made their journey even more gruelling. Farhat Said left el-Fasher with her daughter despite both suffering injuries in artillery fire before the RSF’s final assault on the city. Her husband, who had suffered a severe hip fracture as a result of the bombardment, she said, had to be left behind.\n\n“We had to stay for six to seven months under siege and the shelling and bombardment,” she told Al Jazeera. “It was difficult to move him at all,” she added.\n\n“When the fighting was too much and the shelling was unbearable, my son, who is 11 years old, asked me to run away from home to save our lives,” she said. Her son stayed behind with his father – the couple feared that even though he is a child, as a male, it would be too dangerous for him to cross RSF lines.\n\nThe two-day journey on foot, which would have been impossible for Said’s husband, involved “walking and even running under the heavy shelling out of el-Fasher” and brought them through RSF checkpoints. The mother and daughter arrived in Tawila, roughly 65km (40 miles) west of el-Fasher, without money or possessions. Her daughter still requires medical treatment for her injuries, Said told Al Jazeera.\n\nKhadiga Abdalla, 46, experienced similar trauma. She lost her husband to the RSF bombardment a year ago and was herself wounded. The siege conditions had forced residents to survive on whatever they could find.\n\n“We did not get our usual food, the sorghum, for six months,” she told Al Jazeera. Abdalla said she was forced to eat ambaz, a residue left over from pressed oilseeds that are normally fed to livestock because there was no other food available in el-Fasher.\n\nAfter three days on the road without eating, Abdalla reached Tawila with her two children. One was immediately admitted to hospital, suffering from severe psychological trauma after witnessing the violence. Her brother’s children remain unaccounted for while an uncle was killed in the shelling.\n\nThese accounts align with wider evidence of systematic violence. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that at least 460 patients were killed in RSF attacks on the Saudi maternity hospital in el-Fasher. Health workers were also taken during the initial assault, according to WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier.\n\nThose reaching safety face severe health challenges. Medical teams from Doctors Without Borders working in Tawila have screened arriving children and said malnutrition was affecting all those under the age of five.\n\nSurvivors bear physical evidence of their ordeal, including torture and bullet wounds from their escapes and digestive problems caused by months of eating food meant for livestock.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration estimated that more than 70,000 people have been displaced from el-Fasher and the surrounding areas since October 26. However, humanitarian workers in Tawila, which already shelters more than 652,000 displaced people, reported that the arrivals there have been far smaller than el-Fasher’s population would suggest.\n\nYale’s Humanitarian Research Lab noted that unlike previous RSF takeovers across Darfur, such as the assault on the  Zamzam displacement camp  in April, there were no visible signs of a mass exodus from el-Fasher in recent imagery.\n\nWhen Zamzam’s estimated 500,000 inhabitants fled, researchers were able to identify hundreds of people and donkey carts on roads heading away from the camp. But with el-Fasher, “The majority of civilians are dead, captured or in hiding,” the Yale researchers concluded.\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross President Mirjana Spoljaric described the situation as “horrific” and warned that tens of thousands of people may be trapped without access to food, water or medical assistance.\n\nPope Leo XIV on Sunday joined growing international condemnation of the death and destruction in el-Fasher, denouncing “indiscriminate violence against women and children, attacks on unarmed civilians and serious obstacles to humanitarian action”.\n\nHe called for an immediate ceasefire and the opening of humanitarian corridors.\n\nUnited States senators from both parties have demanded stronger action. Republican Senator Jim Risch, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for the RSF to be formally designated as a “foreign terrorist organisation”, describing the violence as intentional rather than accidental.\n\nThe RSF announced it has arrested several fighters, including a commander named Abu Lulu, who appeared in videos of executions verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency.\n\nFor survivors like Yahya, Said and Abdalla, now in overcrowded displacement camps with minimal support, questions about accountability feel distant.\n\nActivists at the Tawila camp told Al Jazeera that the sudden surge in arrivals has meant aid workers have found it difficult to shelter people and provide them with other essential supplies.\n\n“We pray to God to help us,” Said said, speaking for thousands who made the same desperate journey out of el-Fasher."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/jamaica-declares-disaster-after-monstrous-melissa-ravages-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:27:00+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, devastated multiple Caribbean nations, killing at least 32 people across Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic.

Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica\n\nHurricane Melissa is pummeling the Caribbean island of Cuba after it first caused devastation in Haiti and Jamaica, leading to the deaths of at least 32 people.\n\nTwenty of the reported deaths on Wednesday came after a river burst its banks in the southern coastal Haitian town of Petit-Goave, flooding and collapsing dozens of homes.\n\nThe mayor of the town, Jean Bertrand Subreme, said that people were still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other deaths were reported from Melissa in Haiti. Eight people were killed in Jamaica, including a baby killed after a tree fell in the western side of the island, according to State Minister Abka Fitz-Henley. One person was also reported to have been killed in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs it crossed Cuba on Wednesday, it weakened to a Category 2 storm from its previous Category 5 classification. It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nJamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, according to data from the World Resources Institute.\n\nBut like other tropical islands, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine before starting immunotherapy is associated with significantly improved survival rates in cancer patients, especially those with advanced or 'cold' tumors.

model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c231e284345o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"00:31:53.919+00:00","title":"Trump endorses Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani for New York City mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly endorsed Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race, criticizing Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee and self-described democratic socialist, as a 'Communist' and a dangerous left-wing leader.

Kingdom descended into chaos on Saturday night, when passengers were attacked in a  mass stabbing  inside the train.\n\nEleven people received treatment in hospital following the attack. One of them, a train worker, remains in critical condition after he protected passengers from the knifeman. He was hailed as a “hero” by police and also praised  by Heidi Alexander, the UK’s transport secretary, who said: “He put himself in harm’s way and there are people who are alive today who wouldn’t be alive had it not been for his actions.”\n\nPolice initially arrested two suspects, but later released one, saying he had not been involved. On Monday, the suspect who remains in custody was named as 32-year-old Anthony Williams, from Peterborough, who is also being held on suspicion of attempted murder at a location in London earlier on Saturday.\n\nPolice are still working to uncover a motive for the attack, but said it did not appear to be an act of “terrorism”.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer called the attack an “appalling incident” that was “deeply concerning”, while Interior Minister Shabana Mahmood said she was “saddened” and urged people to avoid comment and speculation.\n\nDowning Street is keen to quell rumours spreading online following an incident in Southport in 2024, when the murder of three young girls sparked  days of riots  across the country.\n\nThe train left Doncaster in northern England at 16:25 GMT on Saturday, November 1, bound for London’s King’s Cross station.\n\nIt had just departed from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, roughly halfway into its two-hour journey, when police began receiving calls alerting them that people were being stabbed on board.\n\nPassengers described panicked travellers, some covered in blood, rushing down the aisle of the train to get away from the perpetrator, who witnesses reported as wielding a “large knife”.\n\nOne man is understood to have been wounded as he tried to shield a woman and a young child. Other passengers locked themselves in train toilets.\n\nThe British Transport Police, which handles security on the UK’s railway network, said it received its first emergency call at 19:42 GMT.\n\nSoon after, the train made an unscheduled stop at Huntingdon station – about 120km (75 miles) north of London. Passengers spilled onto the platform as armed police boarded the train.\n\nPolice said that 10 people were taken to nearby hospitals, and that an 11th went to a hospital on their own. Nine were initially classed as having life-threatening injuries.\n\nBy Sunday night, police said only one remained in a life-threatening condition: a railway staff member who tried to stop the attack. Police called his actions “nothing short of heroic”.\n\nIt is believed so. A rail staff member intervened during the incident by shielding passengers from the assailant. The train worker suffered life-threatening injuries in the process, police said.\n\nThe member of the London North Eastern Railway staff could be seen on CCTV, attempting to stop the attacker as the train travelled from Peterborough.\n\nMeanwhile, the driver who stopped the train at Huntingdon was said to be “very shaken” but “good”. Named as Andrew Johnson, he was reported to be a Royal Navy veteran.\n\nOn Sunday, Johnson, who is from Peterborough, told ITV News: “I was only doing my job.” He added, “It was my colleague who is in hospital who was the brave one”.\n\nBritish Transport Police said that within minutes of the first emergency calls, Cambridgeshire Constabulary officers, the local police, had boarded the train and detained two men.\n\nPolice later released one of the men, a 35-year-old British citizen, without charge, saying they had established that he was not involved in the attack.\n\nThe remaining suspect is a 32-year-old British man. On Monday, British Transport Police named him as Anthony Williams, from Peterborough.\n\nWilliams has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of a bladed article, by Peterborough Magistrates’ Court.\n\nHe has also been charged with another count of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article in connection with a separate incident at Pontoon Dock station in the Docklands, East London, on Saturday.\n\nPolice superintendent John Loveless said that counter-terrorism police were initially called, but that “at this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident”.\n\nHe said that an investigation is being led by British Transport Police, and “it would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause of this incident”.\n\nStill, that did not stop conspiracy theories from swirling around on social media over the weekend. Far-right social media accounts have attempted to exploit the incident.\n\nAn X account called “British Patriot”, which has nearly 5,000 followers, posted an unsubstantiated claim that the man on the train had been shouting “Allahu akbar” (“God is the greatest”, in Arabic).\n\nAnd even after police revealed that the two arrested suspects were British nationals, attempts were made to suggest that pertinent information about their origins was being withheld.\n\nBen Habib, the former Reform UK co-leader, said that, in his mind, it was “almost inconceivable” that the incident was not an act of “terrorism”.\n\nHe added it was “possible” the suspects were British, but said that until police had released their names, “I will remain extremely suspicious until we get chapter and verse”.\n\nOver the past decade, the number of serious crimes involving knives – including homicides – has climbed in the UK.\n\nAccording to the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of serious offences in England and Wales involving a knife or sharp object recorded in the year ending March 2024 was 54 percent higher – a jump of nearly 22,000 cases – than the figure for 2016.\n\nWhile stabbings tend to be concentrated among young people in specific urban places such as London and Manchester, they have drawn public attention and policy responses.\n\nExperts generally agree that issues such as unsupported mental health problems and years of funding cuts to social services have made certain sections of the UK’s youth population more prone to knife crime.\n\nAccording to an August report by the Youth Justice Board, an independent public body, “knife crime is driven by a combination of poverty, marginalisation, adverse childhood experiences, trauma, fear and victimisation, including exploitation”.\n\nSerious knife crime has tapered off in recent months. The ONS reports that the number of serious offences in England and Wales involving knives in the year ending March 2025 had fallen by one percent to 53,047, compared with the previous year.\n\nIn August, the Labour government implemented a new law seeking to crack down on the sale of ninja and samurai swords by making it illegal to manufacture, import, sell or possess (even in private) these weapons.\n\nFor his part, London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan has come in for criticism for failing to stop knife crime under his tenure, which began in 2016.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2024, knife crime rose by 23 percent in London, according to Metropolitan Police and ONS data.\n\nHowever, new London City Hall data shows that knife crime dropped by 19 percent between April and June of this year, compared with the same period last year.\n\nOver the summer, Khan pledged a police funding blitz to tackle shoplifting, robbery, knife crime, and antisocial behaviour in London’s 20 most blighted town centres."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/turkiye-hosts-summit-on-gaza-says-israel-must-stop-ceasefire-violations","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:15:02+00:00","title":"Turkiye hosts summit on Gaza, says Israel must stop ceasefire violations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Turkiye hosted a diplomatic summit in Istanbul bringing together foreign ministers from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, Pakistan, and Indonesia to discuss a UN-backed international stabilisation force (ISF) proposed in a 20-point peace plan by former US President Donald Trump.

to stop its repeated violations of a United States-brokered ceasefire in Gaza and let crucial humanitarian aid enter the embattled Palestinian enclave.\n\nTurkiye’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan made the statement after top diplomats from several Arab and Muslim countries met in Istanbul on Monday to discuss a United Nations mandate for an  international stabilisation force  in Gaza, as proposed in a  20-point plan  by US President Donald Trump to end the war.\n\nTurkiye hosted the foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, and Indonesia at the summit.\n\nAfter the meeting, Fidan said Israel has failed to fulfill its responsibilities laid out in the US plan by “regularly violating the ceasefire” and preventing food, medicine and other humanitarian assistance from reaching the  Palestinians in Gaza .\n\n“We do not want the genocide to restart in Gaza, we want the ceasefire to continue, and we want steps to be taken toward a two-step, permanent peace solution,” Fidan said.\n\n“We do believe that the pressure on Israel from the international society should be sustained,” he added, noting that Israeli attacks have killed nearly 250 Palestinians since the ceasefire took effect on October 10. Al Jazeera’s own coverage has tracked at least 236 such deaths.\n\nThe Turkish top diplomat said his country wants to see a post-war framework for Gaza in which Palestinians ensure Palestine’s governance and security. He added that his comments represented a “joint view” of the nations that participated in Monday’s summit.\n\n“Attacks that are trying to provoke Palestinians should end as soon as possible,” he said.\n\nMonday’s meeting came amid an escalation of Israeli attacks on Gaza and an ongoing blockade on aid, including food and medicines.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  launched a strike spree  across Gaza last week after finding that a body Hamas had transferred to Israel did not match one of the 13 captives to be handed over as part of the ceasefire deal. The attacks killed more than 100 people, including 46 children, within 24 hours.\n\nAlthough Israel on Wednesday said it would resume the deal, its attacks continue to kill Palestinians,  including three  more on Monday.\n\nAid delivery remains inadequate, with half of Gaza households reporting that they have seen the same or worsening food access since the ceasefire, according to a UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) survey released this week. In the north, no food aid convoy has entered via a direct crossing since mid-September, OCHA said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Gaza Government Media Office said it tracked an average of 145 aid-bearing trucks entering the Gaza Strip daily between October 10 and October 31 – representing just a quarter of the 600 trucks agreed upon in the ceasefire deal.\n\nTrump’s Gaza deal had proposed the creation of a so-called international stabilisation force (ISF), an international body intended to oversee security inside Gaza. The plan says the US would “work with Arab and international partners” to “train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza”, relying on consultation with Jordan and Egypt.\n\nBut “nothing is clear” about the mandate, Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu reported from Istanbul, as potential participating nations await further details from the UN Security Council as to the ISF’s precise definition and requirements.\n\nFurther complicating matters is which “international partners” Israel would allow to be part of the ISF. Last week, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel would not accept the presence of armed Turkish forces, raising questions about whose troops could be called upon or refused as peacekeepers.\n\nNetanyahu appeared to diverge from Trump on the meaning of the ISF even as he agreed to the plan. During a joint news conference with Trump, the Israeli prime minister  told reporters  that “Israel will retain security responsibility, including a security perimeter, for the foreseeable future”.\n\nMiroslav Zafirov, a former senior political advisor for the UN Special Coordinator’s Office for the Middle East Peace Process, told Al Jazeera the ISF must be defined under “very clear standards under international law” in order to be effective.\n\n“There are too many elements of the proposal for peace that remain unanswered,” Zafirov said.\n\nTurkiye’s Foreign Minister Fidan said the international community “overestimated” Israel’s readiness to embrace the path towards a two-state solution.\n\n“Israel never agreed on this, and it never had any intention to approve this,” he said. “But the international society has based its opinion on this understanding.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3kz7jxe0po","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:14:04.769+00:00","title":"Worker dies after partial collapse of medieval tower in Rome","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Romanian worker, Octay Stroici, died after being trapped beneath a partially collapsed medieval tower, the Torre dei Conti, located near the Roman Forum in Rome.

(22:00 GMT), nearly twelve hours after a section of the Torre dei Conti, on the edge of the famous Roman Forum and close to the Colosseum, gave way and trapped him beneath.\n\nHis heart stopped in the ambulance, and doctors at the hospital he was rushed to were unable to save him.\n\nThe Romanian foreign ministry said Stroici was a Romanian national, as was another worker among three others pulled

One is said to be in a critical condition.\n\nStroici's rescue was initially described as an exceptional feat by firefighters who had worked late into the night. Rescue teams used drones and rubble clearers to try to reach him, despite the risk that the fragile tower could collapse further.\n\nHe had been conscious and talking to the emergency workers throughout the rescue. His wife was also at the scene.\n\nStroici had been carrying out conservation work on the medieval tower which is part of the Roman Forum, one of this city's busiest tourist sites. But this particular building had been empty and abandoned for many years.\n\nThe Rome Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into the incident.\n\nEfforts to rescue Stroici - reported to be in his 60s - were interrupted when a second section of the 29m (90ft) high tower began crumbling again, with bricks raining down, creating a huge cloud of dust.\n\nEarlier, Rome prefect Lamberto Giannini   had described it as a \"very complex situation\". Giannini said that after the initial collapse firefighters had \"put up some protection\" around the trapped man, so when the second collapse happened, \"they obviously shielded him\".\n\nHe added that the rescue was a long operation due to having to \"mitigate...the enormous risks faced by the people trying to carry out the rescue\".\n\nOne firefighter was taken to hospital with an eye problem, according to local media, but the rest were unharmed, eventually resuming their search for the man.\n\nA police chief said there was no imminent danger that the tower will disintegrate.\n\n\"My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the person currently fighting for his life beneath the rubble, and to his family, for whom I sincerely hope that this tragedy finds a positive outcome,\" wrote Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on X before the rescue was complete.\n\nAnother worker, 67-year-old Ottaviano, who was inside at the time of the collapse but escaped from a balcony uninjured, told the AFP news agency: \"It was not safe. I just want to go home.\"\n\nRome's mayor and Italy's culture minister visited the scene.\n\nThe 13th Century tower is part of the Roman Forum, a major tourist attraction in the centre of Rome, but it is separated from the main visitors' area by a road. The streets all around have been taped off by police as a precaution.\n\nThe medieval tower was built by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his brother."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jrw12d3edo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"08:29:10.666+00:00","title":"At least 20 dead after magnitude-6.3 earthquake hits Afghanistan","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A magnitude-6.3 earthquake struck northern Afghanistan near Mazar-e-Sharif on 3 November 2025, killing at least 20 people and injuring over 530.

exams, but she says practising divorce law is not in her future.\n\nThe 45-year-old, who plays divorce attorney Allura Grant in the Disney+ upcoming legal drama All's Fair, tells the BBC she's \"more into criminal justice and reform work\" and adds, \"I don't think I can ever really do family law\".\n\nKardashian has been studying to become a lawyer for the last six years, undertaking an apprenticeship that negates the need for a university degree.\n\n\"It was the wildest idea that I was going to law school - but to me it all makes sense and I hope that I'm forever curious and always want to try new things,\" she says.\n\nKardashian, who has four children with ex-husband Kanye West, also runs fashion and shapewear brand SKIMS and appears in the reality series The Kardashians with her family.\n\nHer interest in criminal justice has been documented on her reality TV shows, where she has advocated for prison reform in the US and sentence reduction for first-time offenders.\n\nNot content with her already packed-out schedule, her recent pivot to acting has raised eyebrows - but it hasn't dented Kardashian's ambition.\n\n\"I guess I just don't live in those expectation boxes,\" she says.\n\nShe says she \"loves taking on constructive criticism\" but doesn't understand why people think she \"can't do something that you want to do or are curious or want to learn about\".\n\nHer first real introduction to acting was her 2023 casting in the 12th season of American Horror Story, in which she appeared as a publicist.\n\nKardashian received mostly positive critical reviews for her portrayal, which encouraged her to take on more acting roles.\n\nAll's Fair reunites the star with American Horror Story showrunner Ryan Murphy, who is also behind hit series such as Glee and Pose.\n\nHis latest project, All's Fair, is a legal drama set in the US, which sees Kardashian play a divorce lawyer alongside Sarah Paulson, Naomi Watts, Glenn Close, Niecy Nash and Teyana Taylor.\n\nKardashian says her priority was to \"come in prepared\" to set, adding she would spend every day \"watching and learning from these women\", who she called \"the best acting coaches in the world\".\n\nShe adds that there was a lot of pressure on her, because those behind the show were \"taking a chance on working with me\".\n\n\"The last thing I would want to do is be unprofessional, be late or not know my lines,\" she says.\n\nAll's Fair, which Disney+ says holds the records for their most-watched trailer of all time, is a spectacular dramatisation of the lives of lawyers tasked with navigating divorce for rich and famous female clients.\n\nKardashian says divorce is \"such a relatable topic\" after experiencing it \"with my family and parents growing up\".\n\nKardashian herself has been divorced three times - most recently to Kanye West in 2022 after eight years of marriage.\n\nWhilst she says the stories of the women in the show \"are not based on anything I've been through\", she was \"definitely inspired\" by practising to be a lawyer.\n\nKardashian's co-star Watts also recognises that, whilst the show might be sensationalised, the story of \"women who feel like they're finished, [their lives] are all over, broken and in pieces\" at the end of a relationship is one that is familiar for many.\n\nNash, who stars as a legal investigator in the show, says that divorce is something many \"have in common with other women and celebrities\" and thinks the show is so appealing due to its relatability, even if it's more dramatic way than real life.\n\nPaulson adds says that although the central theme of the show may be divorce, \"conflict and resolution is a beautiful part of the show\", which also \"tackles big, important and emotional relationships\".\n\nMuch of the talk around the show has been about the strength of the all-female cast, which is filled with some of Hollywood's biggest names.\n\nThe cast all echo that it was Ryan Murphy - who has won six Emmy awards, a Tony award and two Grammy awards in his 25-year career in television, film and theatre - that convinced them to sign up.\n\n\"He [Murphy] calls and I don't tend to say no to him,\" Paulson jokes.\n\nPaulson is perhaps one of Murphy's greatest collaborators, having appeared in nine series of American Horror Story between 2011 and 2021.\n\nKardashian

'overwhelming', Sean Paul says\n\nJamaican music superstar Sean Paul has said the scale of the effort required to help people in the country is \"overwhelming\" after Hurricane Melissa devastated parts of the island last week.\n\nThe Grammy-winning reggae singer said the category five storm was \"very frightening, especially for my young kids\".\n\n\"That's the first time they've seen trees dance like that and the wind move like that,\" he told BBC News. \"They're in shock still, and traumatised. And can you imagine the children who are in the epicentre of it? It feels like you're in the Middle Ages.\"\n\nWinds of up to 185mph (295 km/h) caused at least 28 deaths. Paul and his family were in the capital Kingston, while areas further west suffered the greatest damage.\n\nThe singer said: \"It is really difficult to bear. We weren't hit in Kingston very hard, but it was frightening. And you're wondering, at any minute now is there going to be, you know, some tree that comes along and slaps your roof off?\n\n\"That happened to friends of mine in Montego Bay. They've lost their whole roof, and they're still in the trenches helping people there, making sure that food reaches and clothes reach [people]. Everybody's stuff is all muddied up and it's hard to think about something positive at this time.\"\n\nPaul has pledged $50,000 (£38,000) to match donations to Food For The Poor Jamaica, and described the devastation as \"a very mind-blowing situation\".\n\n\"After days and days of communication and trying to help out in different ways, on Saturday I broke down,\" he said.\n\n\"It's just the amount of energy it takes, and the depression that starts to set in, and then you have to shake yourself out of it because there's just so much to be done that we haven't even tipped the iceberg yet.\"\n\nHe continued: \"It is overwhelming. I myself took a drive to the country yesterday, the countryside of St Mary, which was not hit as hard, but still hit. They don't have light yet, and a lot of people out there can't even see the rest of what's happening, because once they get charge on their phone, they're just trying to call loved ones to make sure that they're OK.\"\n\nSome people \"don't even know that people are helping them, because a lot of the time they're not able to see these videos of people preparing stuff to send out there\", he said.\n\n\"And so little has been actually distributed... There's still blocked areas, roads that are damaged.\n\n\"I just heard a story of 15 babies that were under three months old, but they're sleeping in cardboard boxes right now. So it's a terrible situation, and we're trying to get help out there as much as possible.\"\n\nFellow Jamaican music star, Shaggy, has also been co-ordinating aid efforts on the island, bringing essentials to locals via small convoys.\n\nAsked how he felt about what had happened, he said: \"Devastated. I don't think I can unsee what I've seen... It's rough, there's a lot of aid coming in.\n\n\"Nobody could really prepare for something like that.\n\n\"We got into the Black River area, which was hit really hard. Everything is flattened. It breaks my heart. I couldn't help but weep. These are my people.\"\n\nHe added: \"I've never seen anything like this, it looks like a bomb exploded.\"\n\nSean Paul said: \"Shaggy has reached out to me, a friend of mine in the business, and he is trying to hold a concert in December. It's a long term thing, so we don't want to hold it next week where no one will know about it.

241 people on board, has said he feels like the \"luckiest man\" alive, but is also suffering physically and mentally.\n\nViswashkumar Ramesh walked away from the wreckage of the London-bound flight in Ahmedabad in extraordinary scenes that amazed the world.\n\nHe said it was a \"miracle\" he escaped but told how he has lost everything, as his younger brother Ajay was a few seats away on the flight and died in the crash in June.\n\nSince returning to his home in Leicester, Mr Ramesh has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), his advisers said, and has been unable to speak to his wife and four-year-old son.\n\nFlames engulfed the Boeing 787 flight when it went down shortly after take-off in western India.\n\nShocking video shared at the time showed Mr Ramesh walking away from the aftermath with seemingly superficial injuries, as smoke billowed in the background.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News, an emotional Mr Ramesh, whose first language is Gujarati, said: \"I'm only one survivor. Still, I'm not believing. It's a miracle.\n\n\"I lost my brother as well. My brother is my backbone. Last few years, he was always supporting me.\"\n\nHe described the devastating impact the ordeal has had on his family life.\n\n\"Now I'm alone. I just sit in my room alone, not talking with my wife, my son. I just like to be alone in my house,\" Mr Ramesh said.\n\nHe  spoke from his hospital bed in India  at the time, describing how he had managed to unbuckle himself and crawl out of the wreckage, and met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while receiving treatment for his injuries.\n\nOf the passengers and crew killed, 169 were Indian nationals and 52 were Britons, while 19 others were killed on the ground.\n\nA  preliminary report  into the crash, published by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in July, said fuel supply to the engines was cut off just seconds after take-off. Meanwhile, an investigation is ongoing and the airline said care for Mr Ramesh, and all families affected by the tragedy, \"remains our absolute priority\".\n\nThis is the first time the 39-year-old has spoken to the media since he has been back in the UK. Several news organisations were invited for an interview and a documentary crew was also filming in the room.\n\nThe BBC had detailed discussions with his advisers around his duty of care before the interview.\n\nWhen asked about his memories of the day of the crash, he said: \"I can't say anything about that now.\"\n\nFlanked by local community leader Sanjiv Patel and spokesman Radd Seiger, Mr Ramesh said it was too painful to recall the events of the disaster, and broke down during parts of an interview at the home of Mr Patel in Leicester.\n\nMr Ramesh described the anguish he and his family are now living through.\n\n\"For me, after this accident... very difficult.\n\n\"Physically, mentally, also my family as well, mentally... my mum last four months, she is sitting every day outside the door, not talking, nothing.\n\n\"I'm not talking to anyone else. I do not like to talk with anyone else.\n\n\"I can't talk about much. I'm thinking all night, I'm suffering mentally.\n\n\"Every day is painful for the whole family.\"\n\nMr Ramesh also spoke about the physical injuries he suffered in the crash, which saw him  escape his seat - 11A - through an opening in the fuselage .\n\nHe says he suffers pain in his leg, shoulder, knee and back, and has not been able to work or drive since the tragedy.\n\n\"When I walk, not walk properly, slowly, slowly, my wife help,\" he added.\n\nMr Ramesh was diagnosed with PTSD while he was being treated in hospital in India but has not received any medical treatment since being back home, his advisers said.\n\nThey described him as being lost and broken, with a long journey of recovery ahead, and are demanding a meeting with Air India's executives, claiming he has been treated poorly by the airline since the crash.\n\n\"They're in crisis, mentally, physically, financially,\" Mr Patel said.\n\n\"It's devastated his family.\n\n\"Whoever's responsible at the highest level should be on the ground meeting the victims of this tragic event, and understanding their needs and to be heard.\"\n\nAir India has offered an interim compensation payment to Mr Ramesh of £21,500, which has been accepted, but his advisers say this is not enough to meet his immediate needs.\n\nThe family fishing business in Diu in India, which Mr Ramesh ran with his brother before the crash, has since collasped, his advisers said.\n\nSpokesman for the family Mr Seiger said they had invited Air India for a meeting on three occasions, and all three were either \"ignored or turned down\".\n\nThe media interviews were the team's way of reissuing that appeal for the fourth time, he said.\n\nMr Seiger added: \"It's appalling that we are having to sit here today and putting him [Viswashkumar] through this.\n\n\"The people who should be sitting here today are the executives of Air India, the people responsible for trying to put things right.\n\n\"Please come and sit down with us so that we can work through this together to try and alleviate some of this suffering.\"\n\nIn a statement, the airline, which is owned by Tata Group, said senior leaders from the parent company continue to visit families to express their deepest condolences.\n\n\"An offer has been made to Mr Ramesh's representatives to arrange such a meeting, we will continue to reach out and we very much hope to receive a positive response,\" it said.\n\nThe airline told the BBC that this offer was made before the media interviews with Mr Ramesh."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn51l324p7lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"00:14:57.443+00:00","title":"Rare footage reveals survival secrets of Africa's top predators","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC documentary series 'Kingdom' reveals rare, real-time behaviors of Africa's top predators, including hyenas stealing food and hiding it underwater, wild dogs rescuing a member from a crocodile, and lion cubs opening their eyes.

behaviours have been caught on camera, including a mother-to-be trying to steal food from wild dogs and outsmarting rivals by hiding a stolen carcass underwater to mask its scent.\n\nThis is just some of the remarkable animal behaviour on display in the new BBC wildlife documentary series, Kingdom, which follows the lives of four rival carnivore families over five years.\n\n​​The scenes include poignant moments as the animals face threats from snare trappings to brutal ambushes and violent territorial battles.\n\n\"We could never have written a script like this, only nature could write this script,\" said executive producer Mike Gunton.\n\n​​Behind the scenes, the Zambia Carnivore Programme works to protect these animals.\n\n​​The team followed four animal families - leopards, hyena, wild dogs and lions - in Zambia's Luangwa Valley, capturing rare moments and revealing the intricate dynamics of life in one of Africa's wildest regions.\n\nViewers will watch five-day-old lion cubs opening their eyes, alongside dramatic scenes shown in Kingdom for the first time, such as a pack of wild dogs rescuing one of their own from the jaws of a crocodile.\n\nOther wild animals like elephants and baboons also feature in the new series, which is narrated by Sir David Attenborough.\n\n​\"Everything about these species has been shaped by millions of years of competition alongside each other,\" said series producer Felicity Lanchester. \"Now…humans are changing that,\" she added.\n\nFilmmakers and scientific researchers in the region have collaborated behind the scenes as the footage is a valuable source of data, informing conservation strategies.\n\n​​\"We got a lot of information that we wouldn't have been able to get otherwise... on topography, diet, movement, births, and deaths,” said Dr Matthew Becker, scientific consultant for the series and CEO of the Zambia Carnivore Programme.\n\nThe greatest threat these large carnivores face is habitat loss, while snaring and a declining prey base also play a role. Wire traps, or snares, are often set for antelope - both for food and illegal trade - but many large mammals become victims as by-catch.\n\nThese pressures are changing pack sizes, diets and survival strategies, according to Dr Becker. A single incident can have knock-on effects, impacting dozens or even hundreds of animals.\n\n​​In one scene, a wild dog reappears after losing a leg in a snare trap. Despite his injury, his natal pack welcomes him back, ensuring he eats his share and keeps up on hunts.\n\n​​For those not as fortunate, the Zambia Carnivore Programme exists to protect them. The organisation, along with other local groups, removes snares, safeguards dens and provides information for law enforcement on illegal trade in ivory and bushmeat.\n\nReflecting on the conservation focus of the series, Dr Becker said: \"Ultimately, it's a message of optimism in the face of some very concerning trends.\"\n\n​​Its incorporation in wildlife programmes is now an inevitability, according to the producers.\n\nThe external forces acting on these creatures are clear and series like Kingdom can shed light on the need to protect them.\n\nSpeaking about conservation, ​​series editor, Simon Blakeney, said: ​​\"It’s a challenge, but it's not hopeless.\"\n\nKingdom begins on BBC One at 18:20 GMT on Sunday and will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyv8g28zd7mo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"18:57:57.395+00:00","title":"Uganda and Kenya landslides leave more than 40 people dead","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Multiple landslides have struck the mountainous border region between Uganda and Kenya, resulting in over 40 deaths, including 14 schoolchildren in Kenya's Great Rift Valley and at least 18 in Uganda.

Dagolo?\n\nMohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as \"Hemedti\", has emerged as a dominant figure on Sudan's political stage, with his paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) now controlling half of the country.\n\nThe RSF scored a notable victory recently when it overran the city of el-Fasher, the last garrison held by the Sudanese army and its local allies in the western region of Darfur.\n\nFeared and loathed by his adversaries, Hemedti is admired by his followers for his tenacity, ruthlessness, and his promise to tear down a discredited state.\n\nHemedti has humble origins. His family is from the Mahariya section of the camel-herding, Arabic-speaking Rizeigat community that spans Chad and Darfur.\n\nHe was born in 1974 or 1975 - like many from a rural background, his date and place of birth were not registered.\n\nLed by his uncle Juma Dagolo, his clan moved into Darfur in the 1970s and 80s, fleeing war and seeking greener pastures and were allowed to settle.\n\nAfter dropping out of school in his early teens, Hemedti earned money trading camels across the desert to Libya and Egypt.\n\nAt the time, Darfur was Sudan's wild west - poor, lawless and neglected by the government of then-President Omar al-Bashir.\n\nArab militiamen known as the Janjaweed - including a force commanded by Juma Dagolo - were attacking the villages of the indigenous Fur ethnic group.\n\nThis cycle of violence led to a full-scale rebellion in 2003, in which Fur fighters were joined by Masalit, Zaghawa and other groups, saying they had been ignored by the country's Arab elite.\n\nIn response, Bashir massively expanded the Janjaweed to spearhead his counter-insurgency efforts. They quickly won notoriety for burning, looting, raping and killing.\n\nHemedti's unit was among them, with a report by African Union peacekeepers saying it attacked and destroyed the village of Adwa in November 2004, killing 126 people, including 36 children.\n\nA US investigation determined that the Janjaweed were responsible for genocide.\n\nThe Darfur conflict was referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC), which brought charges against four men, including Bashir, who has denied carrying out genocide.\n\nHemedti was one of the many Janjaweed commanders deemed too junior to be in the prosecutor's sights at that time.\n\nJust one, the Janjaweed \"colonel of colonels\", Ali Abdel Rahman Kushayb, was brought to court.\n\nLast month he was found guilty on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity and he will be sentenced on 19 November.\n\nIn the years following the height of the violence in 2004, Hemedti played his cards skilfully, rising to become head of a powerful paramilitary force, a corporate empire, and a political machine.\n\nIt is a story of opportunism and entrepreneurship. He briefly mutinied, demanding back-pay for his soldiers, promotions and a political position for his brother. Bashir gave him most of what he wanted and Hemedti rejoined the fold.\n\nLater, when other Janjaweed units mutinied, Hemedti led the government forces that defeated them, in the process taking control of Darfur's biggest artisanal gold mine at a place called Jebel Amir.\n\nRapidly, Hemedti's family company Al-Gunaid became Sudan's largest gold exporter.\n\nIn 2013, Hemedti asked - and got - formal status as head of a new paramilitary group, the RSF, reporting directly to Bashir.\n\nThe Janjaweed were folded into the RSF, getting new uniforms, vehicles and weapons - and also officers from the regular army who were brought in to help with the upgrade.\n\nThe RSF scored an important victory against the Darfur rebels, did less well in fighting an insurgency in the Nuba Mountains adjacent to South Sudan, and took a subcontract to police the border with Libya.\n\nOstensibly curbing illicit migration from Africa over the desert to the Mediterranean, Hemedti's commanders also excelled in extortion and, reportedly, people-trafficking.\n\nIn 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called on the Sudanese army to send troops to fight against the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nThe contingent was commanded by a general who had fought in Darfur, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, now the head of the army at war with the RSF.\n\nHemedti saw a chance and negotiated a separate, private deal with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE to provide RSF mercenaries.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi connection proved most consequential. It was the beginning of a close relationship with the Emirati president, Mohamed bin Zayed\n\nYoung Sudanese men - and increasingly from neighbouring countries too - trekked to the RSF recruiting centres for cash payments of up to $6,000 (£4,500) on signing up.\n\nHemedti struck a partnership with Russia's Wagner Group, receiving training in return for commercial dealings, including in gold.\n\nHe visited Moscow to formalise the deal, and was there on the day that Russia invaded Ukraine. After the war in Sudan broke out, he denied the RSF was getting help from Wagner.\n\nAlthough the RSF's main combat units were increasingly professionalised, it also encompassed a coalition of irregular old-style ethnic militia.\n\nAs the regime faced mounting popular protests, Bashir ordered Hemedti's units to the capital Khartoum.\n\nPunning on his name, the president dubbed him himayti, \"my protector\", seeing the RSF as a counterweight to potential coup makers in the regular army and national security.\n\nIt was a miscalculation. In April 2019, a vibrant camp of civic protesters surrounded the military headquarters demanding democracy.\n\nBashir ordered the army to open fire on them. The top generals - Hemedti among them - met and decided to depose Bashir instead. The democracy movement celebrated.\n\nFor a time, Hemedti was lionised as the fresh face of Sudan's future. Youthful, personable, actively meeting diverse social groups, and positioning himself as the challenger to the country's historic establishment, he tried to change his political colours. That lasted just a few weeks.\n\nAs he and the joint head of the ruling military council, Burhan, stalled on handing power to civilians, the protesters stepped up their rallies, and Hemedti unleashed the RSF, which killed hundreds of people, raped women, and  threw men into the River Nile with bricks tied to their ankles, according to a report by campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) .\n\nHemedti has denied the RSF committed atrocities.\n\nPressed by the quartet of countries formed to promote peace and democracy in Sudan - the US, UK, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - the generals and the civilians agreed to a compromise drafted by African mediators.\n\nFor two years, there was an unstable coexistence of a military-dominated sovereign council and a civilian cabinet.\n\nAs a cabinet-appointed committee investigating the companies owned by the army, security and RSF closed in on its final report - which was set to expose how Hemedti was fast expanding his corporate empire - Burhan and Hemedti dismissed the civilians and took power.\n\nBut the coup-masters fell out. Burhan demanded that the RSF come under army command.\n\nHemedti resisted. Days before a deadline in April 2023  to resolve this issue, RSF units moved to surround the army headquarters and seize key bases and the national palace in the capital, Khartoum.\n\nThe putsch failed. Instead, Khartoum became a war zone as the rival forces fought street by street.\n\nViolence exploded in Darfur, with RSF units mounting a vicious campaign against the Masalit people.\n\nThe UN estimates as many as 15,000 civilians died, and the US described it as genocide. The RSF denied the allegation.\n\nRSF commanders circulated videos of their fighters torturing and killing, advertising the atrocities and their sense of impunity.\n\nThe RSF and its allied militia rampaged across Sudan, pillaging cities, markets, universities, and hospitals.\n\nAn avalanche of looted goods are for sale in what are popularly known as \"Dagolo markets\" reaching beyond Sudan into Chad and other neighbouring countries. The RSF has denied its fighters are involved in looting.\n\nTrapped in the national palace under attack from artillery and airstrikes, Hemedti was badly injured in the early weeks of the conflict and disappeared from public view.\n\nWhen he reappeared months later he showed no remorse for atrocities and was no less determined to win the war on the battlefield.\n\nThe RSF has acquired modern weapons including sophisticated drones, that it has used to strike Burhan's de facto capital, Port Sudan, and which played a crucial role in the assault on el-Fasher.\n\nInvestigative reporting by, among others, the New York Times, has documented that these are transported through an airstrip and supply base built by the UAE just inside Chad. The UAE denies that it is arming the RSF.\n\nWith this weaponry, the RSF is locked in a strategic stalemate with its former partner, the Sudanese army.\n\nHemedti is trying to build a political coalition, including some civilian groups and armed movements, most notably his former adversaries in the Nuba Mountains.\n\nHe has formed a parallel \"Government of Peace and Unity\", taking the chairmanship for himself.\n\nWith the capture of al-Fasher, the RSF now controls almost all the inhabited territory west of the Nile.\n\nFollowing escalating reports of mass killings and widespread condemnation,  Hemedti declared an investigation into what he called violations committed by his soldiers  during the capture of el-Fasher.\n\nSudanese speculate that Hemedti sees himself either as president of a breakaway state, or still harbours ambitions to rule all of Sudan.\n\nIt's also possible that he sees a future as an all-powerful political puppet master, head of a conglomerate that controls businesses, a mercenary army and a political party. By these means, even if he isn't acceptable as Sudan's public face, he can still pull the strings.\n\nAnd as Hemedti's troops massacre civilians in al-Fasher, he is confident that he enjoys impunity in a world that does not care much.\n\nAlex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in the US.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv1ddevk9go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:08:25.501+00:00","title":"Tanzania elections: Samia Suluhu Hassan sworn in as president after unrest","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been sworn in for a second term following a presidential election that was widely criticized by international observers and opposition parties as a sham, marred by violent protests and a nationwide internet shutdown.

after unrest\n\nTanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been sworn in for a second term amid tight security, following an election marred by violent protests and rejected by the opposition as a sham.\n\nThe inauguration ceremony was held at a military parade ground in the capital, Dodoma, instead of a stadium as in previous years. It was closed to the public but was shown live on state TV.\n\nSamia was declared the winner on Saturday with 98% of the vote. She faced little opposition with key rival candidates either imprisoned or barred from running.\n\nInternational observers have raised concerns about the transparency of the election and its violent aftermath, with hundreds of people reportedly killed.\n\nOn Monday, election observers from southern African regional body Sadc, of which Tanzania is a member, issued a strong statement, saying that in most areas, \"voters could not express their democratic will\". The observers highlighted restrictions on the oppostion and suspected ballot stuffing.\n\nThe authorities have sought to downplay the scale of the violence. It has been difficult to obtain information from the country or verify the death toll, as a nationwide internet shutdown was in place from election day, last Wednesday, until Monday afternoon. Access remains severely restricted, especially to social media sites and messages platforms, reports internet monitor NetBlocks.\n\nAfter being sworn in, President Samia thanked the electoral commission for running the elections with \"unquestionable efficiency\".\n\nShe expressed sadness over the violence that had resulted in \"loss of lives and destruction of public property\", describing it as a blot on Tanzania's image.\n\nSome Tanzanians have told the BBC they have not seen their relatives since polling day.\n\nA woman who asked to only be identified as Mama Kassim told the BBC that she has not seen her two sons since election day last Wednesday - and was unable to reach one of them.\n\n\"I don't know where he is, I don't know whether he has been arrested, I don't know if he is injured, I don't know if he is hospitalised, I don't know if he is dead.\"\n\n\"Oh God, protect my son. He's only 21 years old,\" she said.\n\nAnother Tanzanian told the BBC he had not yet returned home in Dar es Salaam from his workplace since Wednesday due to a lack of transport.\n\n\"I had only 10,000 shillings ($4) on my phone. I sent it to my family on Friday to buy food, but it wasn't enough and it ran out yesterday. I have no more money. My children are hungry,\" he said.\n\nOpposition leaders and activists have said hundreds were killed in clashes with security forces. The opposition Chadema party told the AFP news agency that it had recorded \"no less than 800\" deaths by Saturday, while a diplomatic source in Tanzania told the BBC there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died.\n\nThe UN human rights office earlier said there were credible reports of at least 10 deaths in three cities.\n\nFollowing the unrest, the prices of food, fuel and other essentials have doubled or tripled in many areas. Schools and colleges are closed and there is no public transport.\n\nDuring her inauguration ceremony, attended by the presidents of Somalia, Zambia, Mozambique and Burundi, Samia ordered authorities to immediately ensure that people's lives returned to normal.\n\nShe said \"it was not surprising\" that some of those arrested were not Tanzanians, adding that security agencies were investigating.\n\nChadema - which was barred from competing - rejects the results announced by the electoral commission, saying they had \"no basis in reality as the truth is that no genuine election took place in Tanzania\". It has called for a fresh election.\n\nOn election day, polling stations remained largely empty - but the electoral authorities later said turnout had been 87%.\n\nOn Sunday, police spokesman David Misime blamed motorbike operators and foreign nationals for the violent demonstrations and vandalism.\n\nHe said there were individuals who had \"entered the country illegally with the intention of causing chaos\".\n\nMr Misime urged Tanzanians to report \"any foreigner who is unknown or whose activities in Tanzania are unclear\" to the authorities.\n\nHis remarks come amid reports that several Kenyan nationals have gone missing in Tanzania. Kenyan activist Hussein Khalid said on X that he had received reports of a Kenyan teacher being killed and others still unaccounted for.\n\nThe situation in Tanzania has sparked global concern, with Pope Leo XIV on Sunday calling for prayers, saying post-election violence had erupted \"with numerous victims\".\n\nEU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas urged Tanzanian authorities to exercise restraint to preserve lives, while UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation \"including reports of deaths and injuries\".\n\nThe country's two main opposition leaders did not contest the election - Tundu Lissu is being held on treason charges, which he denies, while Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo party was excluded on legal technicalities.\n\nSixteen fringe parties, none of whom have historically had significant public support, were allowed to run.\n\nThe ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), and its predecessor Tanu, have dominated the country's politics and have never lost an election since independence.\n\nAhead of the election, rights groups condemned government repression, with Amnesty International citing a \"wave of terror\" involving enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of opposition figures.\n\nThe government rejected the claims, and officials said the election would be free and fair.\n\nSamia came into office in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyklpy88lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"07:32:37.639+00:00","title":"Five moments that defined India's women's World Cup glory","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India's women's cricket team achieved a historic victory by winning their first-ever Women's World Cup by defeating South Africa by 52 runs in a dramatic final at DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai.

From three straight defeats in the group stage to a flawless knockout run, India's turnaround was as dramatic as it was defining.\n\nFor a cricket-mad nation long waiting for its women to stand shoulder to shoulder with its men, this triumph felt epochal - the spark of a new era. Here are the five moments that shaped India's road to glory.\n\nIt was an unexpected move that stunned everyone.\n\nShafali Verma - playing only because regular opener Pratika Rawal was injured - is a part-time spinner in the  Virender Sehwag  mould.\n\nYet she struck gold, removing Sune Luus with her second ball and Marizanne Kapp with her seventh, halting South Africa's chase in its tracks.\n\nAfter the match, skipper Harmanpreet Kaur said she'd gone with her gut - \"it felt like her day.\" Having earlier smashed 87, Verma fittingly took home the Player of the Match award.\n\nSouth Africa's opener and captain Laura Wolvaardt had been the pre-eminent batter in the tournament, not only leading the run-scorer's list, but also slamming a century in the semi-final to knock out England.\n\nIn the final, she threatened to do the same against India with another magnificent century.\n\nWith 78 needed, Wolvaardt went for broke - but her lofted hit off Deepti Sharma was skied to long-on. Amanjot Kaur, the 25-year-old daughter of a carpenter from Punjab, sprinted in, juggled thrice, and finally clung on in a tumbling catch that sent the stadium - and India - roaring.\n\nWolvaardt stood between India and victory. Amanjot had held her nerve, and the catch for dear life. The path to victory had been cleared.\n\nOn a dewy night, Jemimah Rodrigues powered India to one of the greatest chases in women's cricket to reach the World Cup final.\n\nHer unbeaten 127 in the semi-final against Australia was the very definition of a tour de force.\n\nPromoted to No 3, Jemimah played the innings of a lifetime, steering India past a record target against their long-time nemesis - the Australians who had thwarted India's ICC dreams for over a decade.\n\nHer innings was a masterclass in building a match-winning knock under pressure.\n\nWalking in after two early wickets - including the prolific mainstay Smriti Mandhana - she steadied the innings with superb technique, sharp match awareness, and bursts of flair. Her 167-run stand with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur became the bedrock of India's record run chase.\n\nThe most compelling aspect of Jemimah's amazing innings was the  mental and emotional setbacks  she had to overcome before and during the tournament, including being dropped for a match. She finished the match in tears of redemption and everlasting glory.\n\nJemimah's innings helped India hunt down a record 338 in a pulsating edge-of-the-seat finish - winning by five wickets with five balls to spare.\n\nA touch below her best with the bat - though her crucial 89 against Australia powered India into the final - Harmanpreet's true impact lay in her leadership.\n\nComposed, tactical, and fearless, she was the steady hand that guided India through the pressure of knockout cricket.\n\nUnder intense scrutiny after three straight defeats mid-tournament, Harmanpreet rallied her team with calm authority - regrouping swiftly and brilliantly through a series of bold, inspired calls.\n\nBringing Jemimah back into the XI - a move widely criticised at the time -  was vindication enough.\n\nBut promoting her to No 3 was the masterstroke that transformed India's campaign.  A fluent half-century against New Zealand, a rousing century in the semi-final against Australia, and a vital knock in the final cemented Jemimah's role as the pivot around which India's batting thrived.\n\nBacking Shafali Verma to bowl in a tense final was an inspired call - a gamble, perhaps, but one that paid off handsomely.\n\nThrough the pressure of the semi-final and final, Harmanpreet's composure never wavered. Unflustered and astute, she held the team together with smart, timely decisions.\n\nDeepti Sharma ended the tournament as its leading wicket-taker -  a feat remarkable in itself, yet only half the story of her impact.\n\nHer crucial runs in the knockout matches were just as vital, making her one of the true architects of India's title triumph.\n\nAgainst Australia, Deepti turned the game twice over - first with a double strike in a tense closing spell that likely saved 15–20 runs, then with a spirited, attacking 24 that kept India's pulsating chase on track.\n\nIn the final against South Africa, Deepti went one better - a run-a-ball 58 that powered India past 250, followed by a stunning 5 for 39. It was one of the finest all-round performances in World Cup history - men's or women's."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0kpd97qqko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"15:09:25.660+00:00","title":"Israeli military's ex-top lawyer arrested over leak of video allegedly showing Palestinian detainee abuse","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A leaked video from Sde Teiman military base in August 2024 shows Israeli soldiers allegedly beating and stabbing a Palestinian detainee, sparking a national scandal.

been arrested, as a political showdown deepens over the leaking of a video that allegedly shows severe abuse of a Palestinian detainee by Israeli soldiers.\n\nMaj Gen Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned as the Military Advocate General of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) last week, saying that she took full responsibility for the leak.\n\nOn Sunday, the story took a darker turn when she was reported as missing, with police mounting an hours-long search for her on a beach north of Tel Aviv.\n\nShe was subsequently found alive and well, police said, but was then taken into custody.\n\nThe fallout from the leaked video is intensifying by the day.\n\nBroadcast in August 2024 on an Israeli news channel, the footage shows reserve soldiers at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel taking aside a detainee, then surrounding him with riot shields to block visibility while he was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object.\n\nThe detainee was treated for severe injuries.\n\nFive reservists were charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm to the detainee. They have denied the charges and have not been named.\n\nOn Sunday, four of the reservists wore black balaclavas to hide their faces as they appeared at a news conference outside the Supreme Court in Jerusalem along with their lawyers, who demanded the dismissal of their trial.\n\nAdi Keidar, a lawyer from the right-wing legal aid organisation Honenu, claimed his clients were subject to \"to a faulty, biased and completely cooked-up legal process\".\n\nOn Monday, it emerged the detainee at the centre of the case was released to Gaza in October as part of an exchange with Hamas of convicted prisoners and detainees held without charge by Israel for hostages held by Hamas since 7 October 2023.\n\nLast week, a criminal investigation was launched into the leaking of the video.\n\nGen Tomer-Yerushalmi was put on leave while the inquiry took place.\n\nOn Friday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said she would not be allowed to return to her post.\n\nShortly after that, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned.\n\nIn her resignation letter, she said she took full responsibility for any material that was released to the media from the unit.\n\n\"I approved the release of material to the media in an attempt to counter false propaganda against the army's law enforcement authorities,\" she said.\n\nThat is a reference to efforts by some right-wing political figures in Israel to claim that the allegations of severe abuse of the Palestinian detainee had been fabricated.\n\nShe added: \"It is our duty to investigate whenever there is reasonable suspicion of acts of violence against a detainee.\"\n\nAfter her resignation, Katz issued a fierce condemnation of her conduct.\n\n\"Anyone who spreads blood libels against IDF troops is unfit to wear the army's uniform,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed his defence minister's words on Sunday, saying that the incident at Sde Teiman was \"perhaps the most severe public relations attack that the State of Israel has experienced since its establishment\".\n\nHours later, the first reports began appearing in the Israeli media that Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was missing, sparking fears that a political scandal had taken a turn towards tragedy.\n\nA massive search effort was launched. Several hours later, she was found \"safe and in good health\" in the coastal area of Herzliya, Israeli police said.\n\nOvernight, a police spokesperson announced that two people had been arrested on suspicion of \"leaking and other serious criminal offences\" as part of an investigation.\n\nIsraeli media reported that the pair were Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi and the former chief military prosecutor, Col Matan Solomosh.\n\nThe Sde Teiman incident has been a lightning rod for the division between the left and right in Israel.\n\nOn the right, the leaking of the video is denounced as a defamation of the Israeli military, all but amounting to an act of treason.\n\nAfter Israeli military police went to Sde Teiman to question 11 reservists over the incident in July 2024, far-right protesters - including at least three lawmakers from Netanyahu's governing coalition - broke into the facility to show their support.\n\nOn the left, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi's decision to enable the footage to be released is seen as the one time she lived up to the responsibilities of her post.\n\nThe video is regarded by the left as concrete evidence backing up multiple reports of abuse of Palestinian detainees since the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.\n\nLast October, a report by a UN commission of inquiry alleged that thousands of child and adult detainees from Gaza had been \"subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence\".\n\nIsrael's government said it rejected the accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees, and insisted that it was \"fully committed to international legal standards\". It also said it had carried out thorough investigations into every complaint."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c986n2q6qy0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"18:57:14.824+00:00","title":"Train-attack accused 'maybe linked to other incidents' - police","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cambridgeshire Police are investigating whether a man, Anthony Williams, accused of stabbing 10 people on a London-bound train in Peterborough, is linked to a stabbing of a 14-year-old boy and two knife-related incidents at barbers' shops in the city.

The shop made a second report the next day.\n\nAnthony Williams, 32, of no fixed abode, was  charged with 10 counts of attempted murder  relating to the train stabbing and a count of attempted murder in connection with an attack in London on Saturday.\n\nA man was left with facial injuries following the attack at about 00:45 at a station in Silvertown.\n\nCambridgeshire Police said in all three incidents a \"crime was raised\" and investigations launched.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer has praised police, first responders and the \"heroic\" actions of the driver and the members of staff aboard the train when the \"vile and horrific attack\" took place.\n\nHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood also paid tribute to the \"breathtaking bravery\" and \"heroic acts of the passengers and train crew who intercepted the attacker\".\n\nAt about 19:10 on Friday, a 14-year-old was stabbed by a man with a knife in Peterborough city centre.\n\nPolice said the victim was treated at Peterborough City Hospital for minor injuries and later discharged.\n\nCambridgeshire Police said: \"The offender had left the scene when the call was made and despite a search of the area by officers and a police dog, the offender was not identified.\"\n\nAlso on Friday evening, a man was seen with a knife at a barbers' shop in the Fletton area of Peterborough.\n\nPolice said the incident took place at 19:25, but was reported to officers two hours later at 21:10, by which time the man had left the shop.\n\nOfficers were not sent, the force added.\n\nThe same barbers' shop called the police at 09:25 on Saturday to report that a man carrying a knife was at the shop.\n\nOfficers arrived at the site within 18 minutes and searched the area, but were unable to locate or identify the man.\n\nCambridgeshire Police said: \"We are currently reviewing all incidents in the timeframe to understand whether there were any further potential offences.\n\n\"British Transport Police retain primacy for the overall investigation, which will include these three incidents.\"\n\nCambridgeshire Police referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), as it typical in these cases.\n\nThe IOPC, however, said it would not be investigating the incident as \"it did not meet the criteria for a valid referral\".\n\nScunthorpe United footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, and Nottingham Forest fan Stephen Crean were travelling on the LNER train from Doncaster to London King's Cross when they were injured during the attack at about 20:00 GMT.\n\nMr Gjoshe was slashed across the bicep and had been operated on, his club said.\n\nMr Crean has been hailed a hero after he confronted the train attacker, going face to face with him in the carriage.\n\nHe described how he \"tussled\" with the man, who was shouting at him as he slashed him on the head and hand.\n\nHe said he was determined to confront the attacker to give another passenger time to close the door of the buffet car, where other passengers had gathered.\n\nIn the House of Commons earlier, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"There's no doubt that their collective action, their brave action, saved countless lives and I know the whole country is grateful for that.\"\n\nHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood said earlier that one member of the train crew \"ran towards danger\" and confronted the knife-wielding attacker.\n\nHis actions stopped the attacker from advancing through the train, she added.\n\nMPs also praised the quick reaction of train driver Andrew Johnson, a former Royal Navy officer.\n\nMr Johnson contacted the control room to get the train diverted from the fast track to the slow track when the alarm was raised.\n\nIt meant it could stop in Huntingdon, which allowed emergency services to quickly access the scene.\n\nMr Johnson said: \"As train drivers, we hold a lot of responsibility. We practise our emergency response and keep up to date with our knowledge of the route, so if needed, we know exactly where to stop and what to do.\n\n\"The action I took is the same as any other driver.\n\n\"I think my colleagues onboard were the real heroes and I'd like to pay tribute to their bravery.\"\n\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on  BBC Sounds ,  Facebook ,  Instagram  and  X ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg41x3w1zvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"22:11:35.592+00:00","title":"Oscar-nominated actress Dianne Ladd, mother of Laura Dern, dies at 89","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Diane Ladd, a three-time Oscar-nominated actress known for her roles in films like Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore and Rambling Rose, has died at the age of 89.

profound gift of a mother, Diane Ladd, passed with me beside her this morning,\" Dern said in a statement, adding that her final moments were spent at home in California.\n\nDern, who starred with her mother in 1991's Rambling Rose,  did not share Ladd's cause of death.\n\n\"She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,\" Dern said. \"We were blessed to have her.\"\n\nLadd's career on stage and screen spanned decades. Her big break in film came as a waitress in Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in 1974, which earned her an Oscar nomination.\n\nShe went on to appear in dozens of films after that, including as recently as 2022, when she played a grandmother in the coming-of-age film Gigi & Nate, and also acted frequently on television shows.\n\nShe was married to actor Bruce Dern from 1960 to 1969.

'whodunnit'\n\nWhen an Antarctic glacier was sparked into rapid retreat three years ago, it left scientists scratching their heads as to what might have caused it.\n\nHektoria Glacier retreated by more than 8km (5 miles) in just two months in late 2022 - and now a new study claims to have the answer.\n\nThe authors believe that Hektoria could be the first modern example of a process where the front of a glacier resting on the seabed rapidly destabilises.\n\nThat could lead to much faster sea-level rise if it happened elsewhere in Antarctica, they say.\n\nBut other scientists argue that this part of the glacier was actually floating in the ocean – so while the changes are impressive, they are not so unusual.\n\nFloating tongues of glaciers extending into the sea – called ice shelves – are much more prone to breaking up than glacier fronts resting on the seabed.\n\nThat's because they can be more easily eaten away by warm water underneath.\n\nThat Hektoria has undergone huge change is not contested. Its front retreated by about 25km (16 miles) between January 2022 and March 2023, satellite data shows.\n\nBut unravelling the causes is like a \"whodunnit\" mystery, according to study lead author Naomi Ochwat, research affiliate at the University of Colorado Boulder and post-doctoral researcher at the University of Innsbruck.\n\nThe case began way back in 2002 with the extraordinary collapse of an ice shelf called Larsen B in the eastern Antarctic Peninsula. About 3250 sq km (1250 sq miles) of ice shelf was lost, roughly the size of Cambridgeshire or Gloucestershire.\n\nLarsen B had been effectively holding Hektoria Glacier back. Without it, Hektoria's movement sped up and the glacier thinned.\n\nBut the bay vacated by the ice shelf was eventually filled with sea-ice \"fastened\" to the seabed, helping to partly stabilise Hektoria.\n\nThat was until early 2022, when the sea-ice broke up.\n\nWhat followed was further loss of floating ice from the front of Hektoria, as large, flat-topped icebergs broke off or \"calved\", and the ice behind sped up and thinned.\n\nThat is not unusual. Iceberg calving is a natural part of ice sheet behaviour, even though human-caused  climate change  makes the loss of ice shelves much more likely.\n\nWhat was unprecedented, the authors argue, was what happened in late 2022, when they suggest the front of the glacier was \"grounded\" - resting on the seabed - rather than floating.\n\nIn just two months, Hektoria retreated by 8.2km. That would be nearly ten times faster than any grounded glacier recorded before, according to the study, published in  Nature Geoscience .\n\nThis extraordinary change, the authors say, could be thanks to an ice plain - a relatively flat area of bedrock on which the glacier lightly rests.\n\nUpward forces from the ocean water could \"lift\" the thinning ice essentially all at once, they argue - causing icebergs to break off and the glacier to retreat in quick time.\n\n\"Glaciers don't usually retreat this fast,\" said co-author Adrian Luckman, professor of geography at Swansea University.\n\n\"The circumstances may be a little particular, but this rapid retreat shows us what may happen elsewhere in Antarctica where glaciers are lightly grounded, and sea-ice loses its grip,\" he added.\n\nWhat makes this idea even more tantalising is that this process has never been observed in the modern world, the authors say. But  markings on the seafloor  suggest it may have triggered rapid ice loss into the ocean in the Earth's past.\n\n\"What we see at Hektoria is a small glacier, but if something like that were to happen in other areas of Antarctica, it could play a much larger role in the rate of sea-level rise,\" said Dr Ochwat.\n\nThat could include Thwaites – the  so-called \"doomsday\" glacier  because it holds enough ice to raise global sea-levels by 65cm (26in) if it melted entirely.\n\n\"It's really important to understand whether or not there are other ice plain areas that would be susceptible to this kind of retreat and calving,\" Dr Ochwat added.\n\nBut other researchers have contested the study's findings.\n\nThe controversy surrounds the position of the \"grounding line\" or \"grounding zone\" - where the glacier loses contact with the seabed and starts to float in the ocean.\n\n\"This new study offers a tantalising glimpse into what could be the fastest rate of retreat ever observed in modern-day Antarctica,\" said Dr Frazer Christie, glaciologist and senior Earth observation specialist at Airbus Defence and Space.\n\n\"But there is significant disagreement within the glaciological community about the precise location of Hektoria Glacier's grounding line because it's so difficult to get accurate records from radar satellites in this fast-flowing region,\" he added.\n\nThe location of the grounding line may sound trivial, but it is crucial to determine whether the change was truly unprecedented.\n\n\"If this section of the ice sheet was in fact floating [rather than resting on the seabed], the punchline would instead be that icebergs calved from an ice shelf, which is much less unusual behaviour,\" said Dr Christine Batchelor, senior lecturer in physical geography at Newcastle University.\n\n\"I think the mechanism and rate of retreat proposed are plausible in Antarctic ice plain settings, but because of uncertainty about where the grounding zone was located at Hektoria, I am not fully convinced that this has been observed here,\" she added.\n\nBut where there is little debate is that the fragile white continent – once thought largely immune from the impacts of global warming – is now changing before our eyes.\n\n\"While we disagree about the process driving this change at Hektoria, we are in absolute agreement that the changes in the polar regions are scarily rapid, quicker than we expected even a decade ago,\" said Anna Hogg, professor of Earth observation at the University of Leeds.\n\n\"We must collect more data from satellites, so that we can better monitor and understand why these changes are occurring and what their implications are [for sea-level rise].\"\n\nAdditional reporting by the Visual Journalism team\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter  to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

Campaign\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T17:40:08-05:00\n\nOn a bright autumn afternoon, the air crisp with possibility, Major Mark Park in Queens was filled with hundreds of Zohran Mamdani supporters — men wearing kufi caps and labor union T-shirts, groups chanting in Bengali while unfurling political banners, women pushing baby carriages.\n\nSamuel Levitan, 23, and Ujji Bathla, 21, who have been volunteering for Mr. Mamdani’s mayoral campaign for nearly a year, were huddled in semicircles of young adults, dispensing address lists, pamphlets and door-knocking instructions. They wore bright orange ski caps emblazoned with “Zohran for New York City.” Mr. Bathla’s denim jacket was festooned with political buttons that laid out the candidate’s ideas: “Freeze the rent”; “Fast & free buses”; and “Child care for all.”\n\nBut it was not Mr. Mamdani’s economic policies that initially drew them to his campaign. It was his involvement in the protest movement advocating for Palestinian rights. After two years of demonstrating against the war in Gaza, they had an opportunity to put their activism into a project with the promise of tangible and more immediate success.\n\n“It’s not just protesting into the ether,” said Mr. Levitan, who is studying for a master’s degree in public health at Columbia University. The campaign “is almost like a funnel for all this dispersed energy and passion and drive to be an advocate for something, into a movement that had a clearly defined goal.”\n\nMr. Mamdani, 34, has drawn national and even international attention for galvanizing a come-from-nowhere political movement with his savvy use of social media and his unwavering message of affordability.\n\nBut for many New Yorkers involved in the antiwar movement, Mr. Mamdani’s longstanding activism on behalf of Palestinian rights was the draw — a remarkable development in the most Jewish city outside the Middle East. New York now is home to almost as many Muslims as Jews, according to estimates, and as the election has demonstrated, the city’s politics are changing dramatically.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Mumbai-based diabetologist Rahul Baxi - but not just from patients struggling to control blood sugar.\n\nIncreasingly, it is young professionals asking the same thing: \"Doctor, can you start me on weight-loss drugs?\"\n\nRecently, a 23-year-old man came in, worried about the 10kg he'd gained after starting a demanding corporate job. \"One of my gym friends is on [weight loss] jabs,\" he said.\n\nDr Baxi says he refused, asking him what he would do after losing 10kg on the drug.\n\n\"Stop, and the weight comes back. Keep going, and without exercise you'll start losing muscle instead. These medicines aren't a substitute for a proper diet or lifestyle change,\" he told him.\n\nSuch conversations are becoming increasingly common as demand for weight-loss drugs explodes in urban India - a country with the world's second-largest number of overweight adults and more than 77 million people with Type 2 diabetes.\n\nOriginally developed to treat diabetes, these drugs are now being hailed as game changers for weight loss, offering results that few previous treatments could match. Yet their growing popularity has also raised difficult questions - about the need for medical supervision, the risks of misuse and the blurred line between treatment and lifestyle enhancement.\n\n\"These are the most powerful weight-loss drugs we've ever seen. Many such drugs have come and gone, but nothing compares to these,\" says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi's Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology.\n\nTwo new drugs dominate India's fast-growing weight-loss market. One is semaglutide, sold by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk as Rybelsus (oral) and Wegovy (injectable) - while Ozempic (injectable) has been approved for diabetes in India but is not yet available for obesity. The other is tirzepatide, marketed by American drugmaker Eli Lilly as Mounjaro, primarily for diabetes but increasingly used for weight loss in India.\n\nBoth belong to a class known as GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a natural hormone that regulates hunger. By slowing digestion and acting on the brain's appetite centres, they make people feel full faster and stay full longer. Taken once a week, most of these drugs are self-injected in the arm, thigh or stomach. They curb cravings - and in Mounjaro's case, also boost metabolism and energy balance.\n\nTreatment starts with a low dose that's slowly raised to a maintenance level, and weight loss usually begins within weeks.\n\nDoctors warn that most users can regain weight within a year of stopping, as the body resists weight loss and old cravings return. Prolonged use without exercise or strength training can also strip away muscle along with fat.\n\nAlso, not everyone responds to GLP-1 drugs, and most plateau after losing about 15% of their body weight. Side effects range from nausea and diarrhoea to rarer risks such as gallstones, pancreatitis and muscle loss. India's high-carb, low-protein diet already fuels sarcopenic obesity - the loss of muscle alongside fat gain - and weight loss without adequate protein or exercise can make it worse.\n\n\"With all the media hype and social media buzz, these drugs have become something of a craze among affluent Indians eager to shed a few kilos,\" says Dr Baxi.\n\nThe frenzy, a Delhi-based physician recalls, was evident even at a recent medical conference.\n\n\"Three months after the launch of a new drug, I'd treated about a hundred patients. A colleague said he'd done over a thousand - most using imported jabs bought on the black market.\"\n\nIndia's anti-obesity drug market has surged from $16m in 2021 to nearly $100m today - a more than sixfold jump in five years, according to Pharmarack, a research firm.\n\nNovo Nordisk leads the market with its semaglutide brands, with Rybelsus alone accounting for nearly two-thirds of the market since its 2022 launch, according to the firm. Eli Lilly's tirzepatide (marketed as Mounjaro), launched earlier this year, had become India's second-bestselling branded drug by September, according to Pharmarack. Each monthly injectable pen - four weekly doses - of these drugs costs between 14,000-27,000 rupees ($157–300), steep for most Indians.\n\nWhat India has seen so far may just be the tip of the iceberg. Come March, the patent for semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy - expires here, potentially unleashing a flood of cheaper generics and making them more accessible. Jefferies, an investment bank, calls it a \"magic pill moment\" for India, predicting the semaglutide market could reach $1bn with the right pricing, uptake, and government incentives.\n\n\"What we have heard is that nearly a dozen companies are already ready with generic versions of Rybelsus, the oral drug,\" says Sheetal Sapale, vice-president at Pharmarack. \"But as affordability improves, the risk of misuse rises too.\"\n\nDoctors tell stories of patients being put on high dosage of weight-loss drugs by gym trainers, dieticians and beauty clinics with no authority to prescribe them. Some online pharmacies are delivering drugs after a cursory phone consultation in the absence of a prescription. Beauticians offer \"bridal packages\" promising rapid slimming before the big day. There are fears of spurious medicines flooding the market. Federal minister Jitendra Singh has  \"advised caution\"  on the new drugs.\n\n\"One patient asked me if these new medicines could help his daughter lose seven kilos before her wedding - in three months,\" recalls Dr Bhaumik Kamdar, a Mumbai-based chest physician. \"He wanted to know if they really work.\"\n\nOne challenge in India, doctors say, is the way people perceive obesity - and how that shapes attitudes toward weight loss.\n\n\"Most don't realise that obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease,\" says Dr Muffazal Lakhdawala, a Mumbai-based bariatric surgeon.  \"Many people with chronic obesity try crash diets, lose some weight, then regain even more.\"\n\n\"Here, if you're overweight, people assume you're well-fed and affluent. We've gone so far in avoiding the elephant in the room that we've normalised it.\"\n\nObesity, doctors warn, is a gateway to a host of diseases. \"It's linked to at least 20 cancers, infertility, osteoarthritis and fatty liver - now one of the leading causes of cirrhosis,\" says Dr Lakhdawala. Yet, despite it affecting nearly one in eight people globally, there's still no universal consensus on how to define or classify obesity.\n\n\"The arrival of these drugs has changed the conversation - obesity is now being treated as a disease, not just a lifestyle issue.\"\n\nDoctors across specialities are now turning to weight-loss drugs for more than just obesity or diabetes.\n\nEndocrinologists, diabetologists, cardiologists, and nephrologists are increasingly prescribing them to overweight patients to improve heart and kidney outcomes -  for instance, those preparing for angioplasty or stenting.\n\nOrthopaedic surgeons now prescribe them to help patients lose weight before knee surgery, while chest physicians use them for those with sleep apnea, a disorder that blocks the airway during sleep.  \"For patients with sleep apnoea who avoid using Continuous Positive Airway Pressure  (CPAP)  machines, these drugs can help by reducing weight, which in turn improves their sleep,\" says Dr Kamdar.\n\nEven bariatric surgery is evolving with India's obesity boom. From just 200 procedures in 2004, the number soared to 40,000 in 2022 - a 200-fold rise.\n\nSurgeons like Dr Lakdawala now run multidisciplinary programmes where patients on weight-loss drugs are first guided by endocrinologists, nutritionists, and psychologists for three to six months. \"We don't hand out drugs casually,\" he says. \"Those who don't respond to the drugs or have severe obesity are then considered for surgery.\"\n\nHis message to the growing number of urban Indians seeking quick fixes is blunt: \"Don't use the drugs for cosmetic weight loss - use it for life-threatening weight gain.\"\n\nAnd for those chasing quick fixes to shed just five or 10kg?\n\nHe has simpler advice: \"Cut out sugar - it's the biggest evil. Without that, no weight loss will last. Add four days of exercise a week, and you'll lose those 5-7kg - no injections needed.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/world/americas/hurricane-melissa-jamaica-black-river.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:15:37-05:00","title":"‘The Whole Place Is Blown Apart’: 90% of Jamaican Town’s Homes Destroyed","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Hurricane Melissa, the most powerful storm ever recorded in Jamaica, devastated Black River, destroying 90% of homes and key public infrastructure such as the courthouse, library, schools, and downtown district.

The investigation remains active, leaving it unclear whether law enforcement has since gathered additional evidence.\n\nThe dispute captures the fierce tensions over political activism that have become a defining feature of the second Trump presidency, pitting the Miller family’s concerns for their security against the First Amendment claims of a critic of the administration.\n\nIn an atmosphere in which political violence against Republicans and Democrats has become more common, administration officials have increasingly voiced worries about their security, citing in particular the assassination of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and two attempts in 2024 to kill Donald J. Trump.\n\nBut liberal groups and activists say the White House is seeking to demonize its political opponents and use the levers of government to stamp out opposing views in the name of public safety.\n\nAt the heart of the clash is whether the involvement of federal authorities in investigating a local act of protest, and the tactics used by state and federal investigators, amount to overkill, or whether Ms. Wien posed a true threat to Mr. Miller and his family.\n\nA lawyer for Ms. Wien and a county prosecutor have raised concerns over the conduct of the investigation, including the involvement of multiple federal and state agencies. They have also raised questions about the issuance of the search warrant for Ms. Wien’s phone by state authorities based on evidence that she might have committed a misdemeanor.\n\nMs. Wien’s lawyer, Bradley R. Haywood, said law enforcement agencies were misusing their authority to pursue a political critic.\n\nThe county prosecutor, a Democrat, has accused the state attorney general’s office, led by a Republican, of overstepping its authority in trying to intervene in the case.\n\nA White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, said that the law enforcement response was warranted, noting that Mr. Trump and others in his administration had been targets of members of the public. “Doxxing and any other actions that directly threaten the safety of officials and their families should be resoundingly denounced and thoroughly investigated to ensure attacks against members of the administration are not realized,” she said.\n\nCourt documents cite the Secret Service and F.B.I. as participants in the investigation. Asked for comment, an F.B.I. spokesman said that the bureau had acted appropriately and that the allegations against Ms. Wien that were under investigation went well beyond First Amendment-protected activity. A spokesman for the Secret Service said he was aware of the case and declined to comment further.\n\nOne federal statute makes it a crime to make public information like a home address of a government official, but only if the intent behind the disclosure is to “threaten, intimidate, or incite the commission or a crime of violence,” or with knowledge that the information will be used to do so.\n\nVirginia state law makes it a misdemeanor to publish a person’s name or photograph along with their home address “with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass another person.”\n\nThe investigation centers on Ms. Wien, 65, a retired academic who, along with others, has protested outside the home in northern Arlington where Mr. Miller lived with his family at the time. The police say she has circulated leaflets in the neighborhood denouncing Mr. Miller and his hard-line policies, including on immigration.\n\nOne of those leaflets featured Mr. Miller’s photograph and address. To a state investigator assigned to the case, such identifying information amounted to the kind of harassment that could violate state law.\n\nThe Millers recently moved into military housing in Fort McNair, in Washington, after the protest group in September scrawled messages critical of the Trump administration in chalk on the sidewalk outside their six-bedroom home. One of the messages read, “Stephen Miller is destroying democracy.”\n\nThe state police, accompanied by the F.B.I. and Secret Service, arrived at Ms. Wien’s door on Oct. 1 with a search warrant for her cellphone, according to court filings. A day later, a lawyer for Ms. Wien began fighting the warrant, arguing that it was overly broad and unjustified, violating her rights.\n\n“In 22 years, I have never seen a situation like this,” Mr. Haywood said in an interview. The investigation, he said, raises concerns about whether “our state police is carrying water for an administration that is suppressing free speech.”\n\nA spokesman for the Virginia State Police declined to comment because the investigation remained open.\n\nThe Virginia State Police became involved after a request from Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, according to Richard Cullen, who serves as a counselor to Mr. Youngkin.\n\nThe governor “asked his secretary of public safety to look into it and make sure the family was getting the level of protection they deserved,” Mr. Cullen said. “That’s being prudent in today’s world.”\n\nMr. Youngkin had issued similar instructions in the past about Supreme Court justices and Antony J. Blinken, then the secretary of state, after threats and protests erupted near their homes.\n\nMr. Miller, one of the most powerful figures in the federal government, is a driving force behind the Trump administration’s decision-making on immigration and law enforcement. Security concerns among Republicans and other public officials ramped up after Mr. Kirk’s killing at a public event in Utah, after which Mr. Miller vowed to punish liberal activists and networks that he has cast as terrorists.\n\n“The organized doxxing campaigns, the organized riots, the organized street violence, the organized campaigns of dehumanization, vilification, posting people’s addresses, combining that with messaging that’s designed to trigger, incite violence in the actual organized cells that carry out and facilitate the violence: It is a vast domestic terror movement,” Mr. Miller said on Mr. Kirk’s podcast shortly after his death.\n\n“With God as my witness,” he continued, “we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people.”\n\nMr. Haywood said that Ms. Wien and her fellow Arlington activists were only engaged in peaceful advocacy and not seeking to coerce, intimidate or harass Mr. Miller.\n\n“They were speaking truth to power, and that is really at the core of our Constitution,” he said. “It’s a principle and a right that our country was founded on.”\n\nWhile much of the legal battle played out in sealed court filings, originally at the request of Mr. Haywood, he reversed course in mid-October, noting that the dispute over leaflets and chalk messages had been the subject of local news coverage.\n\n“All that remains confidential is the fact that law enforcement may be conducting an unconstitutional investigation into those who participated in these advocacy efforts,” Mr. Haywood wrote.\n\nAccording to the affidavit used to obtain a search warrant for Ms. Wien’s cellphone, the case began in August, when Mr. Miller’s wife, Katie Miller, complained to the police about a leaflet that had been posted in her neighborhood.\n\n“She informed responding officers that similar fliers had been observed in multiple parks throughout the neighborhood,” the affidavit said.\n\nThe flier declared Mr. Miller was “wanted for crimes against humanity,” and included his home address, according to a photograph of the leaflet included in the affidavit. “No Nazis in NOVA,” it said, using an acronym for Northern Virginia. The flier also urged people to scan a QR code to “demand a congressional investigation.”\n\nMrs. Miller told the police, and Secret Service security camera footage appeared to confirm, that at one point she noticed Ms. Wien walking to the front door of a neighboring home, court papers said. According to the affidavit, Mrs. Miller saw Ms. Wien make a gesture “by pointing her index and middle fingers to her own eyes and then pointing directly at Mrs. Miller.”\n\n“Mrs. Miller interpreted this gesture to mean, ‘I’m watching you,’ and perceived it as a threatening act intended to intimidate or harass her,” the affidavit said. “Based on the timing, context and manner of the gesture, the action is being treated as a potential act of intimidation in furtherance of the conduct under investigation.”\n\nA state police agent, in seeking Ms. Wien’s cellphone, told her that she was being investigated for a possible violation of a Virginia state law that makes it a misdemeanor to publish a person’s name or photograph along with identifying information “with the intent to coerce, intimidate or harass another person,” according to court documents.\n\nMr. Haywood, in court papers, argued that Secret Service agents have gathered evidence showing Ms. Wien had not violated the law. “She made crystal clear that, to the extent that she had been active in protests against the Trump administration, she has never sought to intimidate, coerce, or harass anyone, but rather, to express her strong disapproval of those in leadership who have directed a campaign of oppression against immigrants and other vulnerable members of our community,” the filing said.\n\n“Through this investigation, it is impossible to reach any conclusion other than that Ms. Wien poses no risk of harm to Stephen or Katie Miller — even if harm is as minor as ‘coercion’ or ‘harassment,’” Mr. Haywood wrote in a filing.\n\nAccording to the affidavit for the search warrant, the police in neighboring Fairfax County had acquired a text message Ms. Wien sent to a WhatsApp group in April. It asserted that Mr. Miller, “the evil fascist behind family separations and deportation policies,” had moved into Arlington. It is unclear how or why the Fairfax police had access to communications in that group chat.\n\n“His wife sits their smugly swilling wine on their patio, while her husband orders the arrest of more and more of our Muslim, Arab American, and Hispanic brothers and sisters,” Ms. Wien wrote, according to the affidavit. “My Showing Up For Racial Justice (SURJ) chapter in N. Virginia intends to make his life hell. We have set up a carefully vetted Signal group.”\n\nThat language, the Virginia State Police officer wrote, “clearly demonstrates an intent to threaten, intimidate, coerce or harass Mr. Miller.”\n\nIn recent weeks, the legal fight broadened into a battle over jurisdiction, with the county prosecutor handling the case accusing the state’s attorney general of trying to usurp her authority.\n\nWhen the top prosecutor in Arlington, Parisa Dehghani-Tafti, learned that federal agents had accompanied the local police to execute the warrant, she took the rare step of filing her own motion arguing that additional limits should be placed on what parts of Ms. Wien’s phone could be searched.\n\nThe judge overseeing the matter then ordered the state police to pause its investigation of the phone while she considered the legal issues involved.\n\nAsked for comment, Ms. Dehghani-Tafti said the matter remained pending, “so I am limited in what I can say, but our office believes in the rule of law.”\n\nShe added, “I believe in the First Amendment, and in order to maintain the public trust we have to act with integrity no matter who is a potential target or potential victim, and the rule of law encompasses both prosecuting fairly and protecting constitutional rights.”\n\nAfter her office weighed in, the state attorney general tried to intervene, arguing that the judge’s pause was unfair to the state police. “The Virginia state police cannot comply with their statutory obligations and simultaneously comply with the court’s order,” wrote Theophani K. Stamos, a deputy to Virginia’s attorney general, Jason Miyares, a Republican.\n\nThe involvement of the state attorney general’s office also thrust local politics into the dispute. Ms. Stamos had served as the top prosecutor in Arlington until she lost a Democratic primary to Ms. Dehghani-Tafti in 2019.\n\nMs. Dehghani-Tafti fired back sharply, accusing the state attorney general’s office of misstating the facts of the case.\n\nShe urged the judge to disregard Mr. Miyares’s request, saying that “concerns about individual privacy and potential infringement on First Amendment rights” should be balanced against the importance of a criminal investigation.\n\nThe state attorney general, she argued, had no jurisdiction to weigh in on a misdemeanor investigation. Doing so now, she added, was part of what she described as a larger pattern by Mr. Miyares’s office of trying to push the bounds of the criminal justice system.\n\nMs. Dehghani-Tafti accused the attorney general’s office of trying to “willfully ignore the constitutional rights of the citizens of the commonwealth in hopes that they will receive some relief later.” She added, “That is not justice.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/nyregion/church-pantries-food-aid.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:30:45-05:00","title":"Houses of Worship Struggle to Feed New Yorkers During SNAP Stalemate","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a period of uncertainty over federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), nearly 100 people gathered at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Manhattan to access food from a weekly pantry. The article highlights how religious institutions—such as Catholic and Episcopal churches—have long served as critical lifelines for food-insecure residents, especially in low-income neighborhoods. As the Trump administration announces only partial SNAP payments, fear of benefit reductions spreads, with 42 million Americans—including nearly 1.8 million in New York City—facing food insecurity. The Church of the Good Shepherd, along with other pantries in neighborhoods like Inwood and the Bronx, sees rising demand, with some reporting 17% to 40% increases in visitors.

New Yorkers During SNAP Stalemate\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T14:30:45-05:00\n\nBefore daylight in the cold morning air, nearly 100 people stood bundled in hats and coats, their empty carts parked outside an Upper Manhattan church pantry.\n\nA line had begun forming on the sidewalk outside the Church of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic church in the Inwood neighborhood, at least an hour before the pantry was scheduled to open Saturday.\n\nThe group of people gathered, which included many older and middle-aged adults, came seeking canned goods and fresh produce like green onions, pears and cranberries, fearful that their refrigerators and cabinets could soon be empty as it remained unclear whether the food stamp program would continue to be funded.\n\nAs the government shutdown passed the one-month mark and the Trump administration said it would make only partial payments in November to sustain the program — known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — roughly 42 million people were at risk of receiving food aid late and in reduced amounts, including nearly 1.8 million New York City residents.\n\nStepping in to be a lifeline for families felt like second nature for some churches in New York City.\n\n“We’ve always done this,” said Father George Sears, pastor of the Church of Good Shepherd, who was bagging food in the hallway with volunteers at 7 a.m. on Saturday, preparing to feed over 450 people.\n\nMany religious institutions have continued to make it their mission to provide food and meals to those in need, even as membership and attendance at services have declined. In many cases, more people line up for their pantries than sit in their pews.\n\nPantries have long filled the gap for people who don’t qualify for food stamps or whose benefits don’t stretch far enough. The threat of reductions or funding delays has put the programs under new strain.\n\nMet Council, the largest Jewish nonprofit organization in the country, serves more than 200 locations across New York City, and last week, it saw a 17 percent increase in turnout and is preparing for a 40 percent boost this week, according to the organization’s chief executive, David G. Greenfield.\n\nIn New York City, there are about 600 food pantries scattered across the five boroughs. Gilford Monrose, executive director of Faith-Based and Community Partnerships in the mayor’s office, said at least 90 percent of those pantries are run by either a religious organization or a nonprofit connected to a place of worship.\n\n“As pie is to America, I would say food pantry would be to churches,” Mr. Monrose said. “Especially houses of worship in low-income neighborhoods.”\n\nIn Inwood, Ama Kofi, 51, stepped in line at 7:45 a.m. with her two neighbors from the Bronx. Ms. Kofi said the church pantry, which is open weekly, eases her anxiety about putting food on the table for her husband and three children.\n\n“It doesn’t stress me because I know if I come here, I’ll get something,” she said.\n\nIn the two years she has used the pantry, Ms. Kofi has seen a rise in the number of people who need food.\n\n“There are so many people that come here that don’t qualify for food stamps but they need it,” she said, holding her ticket, No. 219.\n\nPaul Kwon, the food pantry coordinator, said the pantry, which collaborates with Cabrini Immigrant Services, helps more than 400 people each week.\n\nHe said the government’s reluctance to sustain SNAP made him “furious.” The pantry he leads is trying to stay afloat after a $20,000 loss in funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, after the Trump administration took back $80 million that New York received for migrants. The reduction has led the pantry to cut back, he said, and clients are noticing that “the bags aren’t as full.”\n\nMr. Kwon said the pantry spent around $4,600 a week on food assistance, funded by donors and federal, state and local aid. With demand high, the pantry has relied more on community fund-raisers and food drives. As of this year around 35 percent of people who use their pantry are SNAP recipients.\n\nBecause of the growing need, his pantry will stay open for an extra hour from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. starting on Nov. 15.\n\nAccording to the Food Research and Action Center, 39 percent of children, 20 percent of seniors and 10 percent of disabled people across the country depend on SNAP to put food on their tables each month.\n\nGrocery prices have increased around 20 percent since 2020, leaving people who may not have religious affiliations dependent on their neighborhood church pantry.\n\nAlixa Cruz, 70, a retired office worker, walked with a cane from her public housing apartment to the pantry at St. Peter’s Chelsea, an Episcopal church. Ms. Cruz is not a member of St. Peter’s, but comes to find reasonable nutritious foods that would be outside her budget otherwise.\n\nIn a year, she went from seeing the funds on her SNAP card drop from $300 to a bit under $190 a month, but said every little bit still counts.\n\n“SNAP helps me because you cannot live in the city,” Ms. Cruz said. “Everything is expensive.”\n\nIn the Bronx, Lowell Murray, 48, a former contractor, sat on a black stool he brought from home while waiting for the Throggs Neck Community Alliance’s food giveaway to start at the Church of St. Benedict, a Catholic church on Otis Avenue.\n\nMr. Murray, who said he was not able to work for health reasons, said his neighborhood pantry was a resource for healthy food that could be “expensive” even with SNAP.\n\nAngela Torres, executive director of the Throggs Neck Community Alliance, said there was already an intense need for food aid in the Bronx, which has the highest percentage of food insecurity among city boroughs.\n\nThe pantry serves roughly 450 people weekly, she said, and recipients are on edge. “It already wasn’t enough,” Ms. Torres said. “Without SNAP, they are desperate.”\n\nIn Inwood, Ethlyn Colbourne, 81, who is retired and relies on her children, said all she could do was wait to check her SNAP card for funds.\n\n“Maybe they will change their mind or something will happen,” Ms. Colbourne said, pushing her cart slowly. “I’m just waiting.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/virginia-governor-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"18:56:13-05:00","title":"What the Virginia Governor Election Might Portend for Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes how the upcoming Virginia gubernatorial and legislative elections may reflect public reaction to President Donald Trump’s administration actions, particularly federal workforce cuts, the government shutdown, and attacks on higher education.

One of the earliest signs that Donald Trump was on track for a good night came not from a major swing state, but from the well-heeled and highly educated suburbs of Northern Virginia, where Kamala Harris was winning — but not by enough.\n\nIt’s been about a year since that night, and in that time, President Trump has stormed back to Washington and upended the federal government, just as he promised. He has cut hundreds of thousands of workers from the federal payroll, pushed the limits of executive power and, even though his party controls Congress, presided over what will, on Tuesday night, become the longest government shutdown in history.\n\nTomorrow’s off-year elections will give voters their first chance to weigh in on all that upheaval. I’ve got a guide to the big races in places like New York, New Jersey and California here — and The Morning’s Sam Sifton has a fresh primer, too — but tonight, I want to explain why Virginia is again worth keeping an eye on.\n\nNorthern Virginia is home to scores of federal employees, contractors and others who work with the federal government — the kind of people who are directly affected by Trump administration’s push to downsize the federal government. There, more than anywhere else, we’ll get an early sense of whether the cuts resonate at the ballot box.\n\n“Watch the turnout in Northern Virginia,” Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who is based in Alexandria, told me. “If it is relatively low compared to past elections, you can conclude that the actions of the administration aren’t having much of an impact. If it’s higher than past elections, you can conclude it’s a reaction against many of the actions of the administration.”\n\nDemocrats have struggled to coalesce around a message since their 2024 losses, and many have tried to stay laser-focused on the economic issues they believe lifted Trump to victory last year. In New Jersey, Representative Mikie Sherrill has zeroed in on energy costs as she runs for governor; in Virginia, former Representative Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic candidate for governor, has blamed Trump for the steep cost of living.\n\nBut as Spanberger tries to breeze past Winsome Earle-Sears, her underdog Republican opponent, she and her surrogates have also sought to highlight the way Trump’s cuts to the government have directly affected her state.\n\n“We need a governor who will support the thousands upon thousands of Virginia’s families whose livelihoods have been disrupted or destroyed because of DOGE and now this government shutdown,” Spanberger said on Saturday night at a rally in Norfolk.\n\nVirginia Democrats believe that message will work for them well beyond the northern suburbs. Earlier this year, they ran an ad featuring Elon Musk, then the grim reaper of federal cuts through the Department of Government Efficiency, which he has since departed. Now, they’re highlighting Trump’s impact across the state.\n\n“If you look at where our competitive districts are, they are places where the federal government shut down, and the DOGE cuts prior to it, and the attacks on higher ed are impacting people’s livelihoods and the cost of living,” Dan Helmer, a Democratic delegate who represents part of Fairfax County and who is leading his caucus’s effort to elect more Democrats. He is hoping that Trump’s cuts will help his party successfully defend a majority in the House of Delegates for the first time since the 1990s.\n\nSome candidates are taking their message to difficult territory. In the Blacksburg area, which is home to Virginia Tech and is where she narrowly lost a race two years ago, Lily Franklin, a Democrat, has made a point of organizing college students amid the administration’s attacks on higher education. Her race for delegate has become one of the most expensive in the state.\n\nIn a Stafford County House of Delegates district that Trump narrowly won last year, the Democratic nominee, Stacey Carroll, has brought up the government shutdown on the campaign trail in her effort to oust Paul Milde, a Republican.\n\n“We just need to remind people, everyday people that are dealing with a lot of things — because we have a lot of federal workers and contractors in this district that are home and have not been working — that there is still power in their vote,” Carroll said while campaigning over the weekend.\n\nIncumbents are seizing on it, too. In Virginia Beach, Michael Feggans, a Democrat in the House of Delegates, cut an ad directly blaming Trump for the government shutdown. “Donald Trump’s done it again,” Feggans says in the ad. “He’s shut down the government playing politics with Virginia’s economy and people’s livelihoods.”\n\nIf Democrats are successful in Virginia, it doesn’t necessarily mean that a message focused on Trump’s government upheaval will work in other states that aren’t tied so closely to the federal government.\n\nBut it could result in new pressure on lawmakers in Washington to end the shutdown — and offer a model to candidates who plan to seize on the backlash to Trump’s cuts in the midterms and beyond.\n\nthe score card\n\nTomorrow’s elections are the unofficial kickoff to the 2026 midterms, and President Trump has made it clear that midcycle redistricting is central to his strategy to win.\n\nThat has set off something of an arms race as lawmakers in nearly 20 states consider drawing up new maps to help their side. And it’s an arms race that Republicans could be poised to win.\n\nOverall, Republicans could net two to six seats, including the states where new maps have been signed into law, or where redistricting actions have either been taken or discussed.\n\nBut in the not-too-distant future, things could get even more extreme, my colleagues Nate Cohn and Jonah Smith write. If the Supreme Court strikes down Section 2 of the Voting Rights act, there would be no federal law preventing, say, California or Texas from drawing up maps to give one party control of every House seat. That would mean maps could look like this:\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\nThat’s Lanny Breuer, one of Jack Smith’s lawyers, in a statement this week, all but daring congressional Republicans to summon the former special counsel to testify in Washington. Smith, who twice indicted Trump, has been placed at the top of the president’s prosecutorial hit list for his investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have begun investigating Smith, who appears eager to publicly challenge the president and his allies in Congress. Some Republicans, though, have privately expressed worries that giving a credible anticorruption investigator an open mic on the biggest official stage could backfire against the president.\n\nMore on legal fights in Trump’s Washington\n\nThe trial of a man charged with throwing a sandwich at a federal agent’s chest began on Monday. Prosecutors failed to persuade a grand jury to approve a felony charge against him, but then secured a misdemeanor charge against the man, a former Justice Department paralegal.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday will consider the legality of Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose far-reaching tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.\n\nMy colleague Zach Montague tells the story of a lawsuit’s long, twisting journey as it tries to force Trump to honor Congress’s vision for foreign aid.\n\nONE LAST THING\n\nDrink wine? Own a boat? Dabble in woodworking?\n\nWith these factors in mind, and a few keystrokes, Mark Grebner, a statistician from Michigan, produces a single number to predict how you might vote. The rapper Eminem, for example, scored as 58 percent likely to vote Democratic.\n\nWith his database of voting and personal data, Grebner can call up the score of almost any adult in Michigan, my colleague Thomas Fuller reported, to tell friends how their love interests might vote, help politicians find voters to target and predict for inquiring reporters whether a suspect in a mass shooting is a Democrat or a Republican.\n\n“If you give me a name of someone you know in Michigan, I could appall you by how much information I have about them,” Grebner said.\n\nTaylor Robinson and Ama Sarpomaa contributed to this newsletter.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/style/celebrity-endorsements-nyc-mayor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:23:26-05:00","title":"Celebrities to New York City: Pick This Guy!","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Celebrities have played a significant role in the final days of the New York mayoral election, with strong endorsements and public displays of support for Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, including from Lupita Nyong’o, Mark Ruffalo, Spike Lee, and others.

Ms. Nyong’o cast her vote for him because Mr. Mamdani has “the personality, skills and temperament to be an excellent mayor of New York City,” she said.\n\nThe actor Mark Ruffalo volunteered, alongside the comedian Ilana Glazer, to work a phone bank for Mr. Mamdani in the final days of the campaign and the actor Wallace Shawn was canvassing for Mr. Mamdani in the East Village. The filmmaker Spike Lee showed support as well, saying in an August interview with the CNN anchor Victor Blackwell that he would be voting for Mr. Mamdani because “we have to move forward for equality for New Yorkers.”\n\nIn June, the comedian Ramy Youssef invited Mr. Mamdani to join him onstage at the Beacon Theater alongside Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia graduate and pro-Palestinian activist who had just been released from detention. Over the weekend, Mr. Youssef played Mr. Mamdani on “Saturday Night Live,” completing his costume with an array of rings on his fingers.\n\nThe comedian Bowen Yang posted a picture of himself on Instagram in which he was wearing a “Zohran for Mayor” T-shirt, and after voting early the actress Cynthia Nixon, who ran for governor of New York in 2018, posted a video of herself in which she urged others to vote for, as she put it, the “brilliant, young” Mr. Mamdani.\n\nMr. Mamdani had received early support from the model Emily Ratajkowski, who has been outspoken on many liberal issues. She wore a “Hot Girls for Zohran” T-shirt in a video she posted with the candidate in which she urged New Yorkers to vote during the primary race.\n\nThe actress Amy Schumer recently posted a picture of her “Voted by Mail” sticker on Instagram. Though she did not explicitly state her support for Mr. Cuomo, she included a message in which she wrote “rhymes with duomo.”\n\nThe singer Marc Anthony, in a video posted on Instagram, endorsed Mr. Cuomo during the primary, noting that the former governor had supported Puerto Rico whenever it needed him.\n\nIn September, the filmmaker Woody Allen told Bari Weiss, editor in chief of CBS News and founder of The Free Press, that he would vote for Mr. Cuomo because “he will be better for New York.”\n\nAnd Elon Musk, the billionaire head of Tesla, who spent more than $250 million to support President Trump in the 2024 election, endorsed Mr. Cuomo on Monday with a post on X in which he intentionally flubbed Mr. Mamdani’s last name.\n\nWhile Mr. Sliwa has not been backed by prominent celebrities, he has received support from notable New York politicians including the former governor George Pataki and the former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/ford-foundation-heather-gerken-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:00:07-05:00","title":"Ford Foundation’s New Leader Vows to Protect Elections and the Rule of Law","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Ford Foundation, a major international philanthropy with a long history of supporting civil rights and democratic values, is facing political attacks from the Trump administration, particularly from Vice President JD Vance, who has criticized its support for liberal causes and suggested targeting its tax-exempt status.

Gerken, said Friday that the foundation, which has a long history of supporting social justice and civil rights initiatives, was undeterred.\n\nHer central priority, she said, was “defending the rule of law and protecting our election system.”\n\nThough she would not formally start until the next day, her spacious office, high above the soaring atrium garden in the foundation’s headquarters near the United Nations, was filled with markers of her priorities and mementos of her past.\n\nOn one wall was a series of black-and-white photographs documenting the civil rights and suffragist movements. Another wall featured an unlikely image of Justice David H. Souter atop a human pyramid of his law clerks, including a young Ms. Gerken. Nearby, there was a photo of Ms. Gerken, who was until recently dean of Yale Law School, flanked by two of its more prominent graduates, Hillary Clinton and Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nBefore her eight years as dean, Ms. Gerken specialized in election law, both as a litigator and a scholar. She is the author of an influential 2009 book, “The Democracy Index.”\n\nVice President JD Vance, himself a Yale Law alumnus, has long been a harsh critic of philanthropies that he said support liberal causes, and of the Ford Foundation in particular.\n\n“Why don’t we seize the assets of the Ford Foundation, tax their assets and give it to the people who’ve had their lives destroyed by their radical open-borders agenda?” he mused in 2021 as a Senate candidate.\n\nHe has not let up. In September, Mr. Vance denounced the foundation by name in the aftermath of the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk, suggesting the administration could go after its nonprofit tax status.\n\nAsked about Mr. Vance’s comments, Ms. Gerken responded with a history lesson.\n\n“When the Ford Foundation funded the civil rights movement, it was a source of controversy,” she said. “It was incredibly important that we were protected in doing that work. When the Ford Foundation stood up to protect free speech and dissent during the McCarthy era, it was incredibly important that we had the right to do that.”\n\nThe targets of the administration’s attacks on its perceived enemies have included universities, law firms and the news media. Officials have indicated that they now plan to go after the tax-exempt status of liberal philanthropies. The Ford Foundation, with its $16 billion endowment, is expected to be a prime target.\n\nJohn Palfrey, the president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, said Ms. Gerken was “an astonishingly good fit” at a fraught moment. “The challenges that face philanthropy and the rule of law that are unprecedented,” he said.\n\nMs. Gerken, for her part, insisted that protecting democracy is a nonpartisan goal.\n\n“No one believes that an election system should not be free and fair,” she said. “No one believes that people should not have the right to speak. These are the bedrock commitments of any democracy, and it’s really important to hold fast to them.”\n\nAsked for practical examples of what the foundation’s emphasis on protecting democracy would entail, Ms. Gerken pointed to securing the infrastructure of elections.\n\n“We’re going to do everything we can,” she said, “to protect the ability of election administrators to carry out a free and fair elections, to make sure that every citizen has an opportunity to vote without fear or intimidation and that those votes are properly counted.”\n\nPast financial support for election administration from donors has drawn criticism from conservatives. After Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, and his wife, Priscilla Chan, donated more than $400 million for such efforts in 2020, they were accused by Mr. Vance and others of scheming to elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. as president.\n\nIn 2022, a spokesman for the couple said their efforts had been “a one-time donation.”\n\nNathaniel Persily, a law professor at Stanford, said Ms. Gerken was the ideal choice for the job. But he was less sanguine about how her efforts would be received by a divided nation.\n\n“Defining a public interest seems almost impossible in these polarized times,” he said. “This is all the more true for a foundation committed to supporting democracy and the rule of law — two values that now seem to mean very different things depending on the side of the political aisle in which one is sitting.”\n\nMs. Gerken’s admirers praised her fair-mindedness, resolve and talent for reaching across the aisle.\n\n“I don’t really discuss partisan politics these days, but my guess is we have pretty different orientations,” Thomas B. Griffith, a retired federal appeals court judge appointed by President George W. Bush. But he added that he was “a huge fan” of hers for increasing intellectual diversity at Yale Law School.\n\n“I found Heather to be very supportive of the Federalist Society,” Judge Griffith said, referring to the conservative legal group.\n\n“Whether she succeeded in making conservatives feel comfortable at Yale, I don’t know,” he added. “But she certainly made an effort to do so.”\n\nMs. Gerken’s fellow election-law specialists said she faces a daunting task.\n\n“The institutions of American democracy are being torched right now,” Professor Persily said. “The question for all of us working in the democracy space is to consider new institutions that might be built from the ashes.”\n\nPamela Karlan, another voting rights specialist at Stanford, said Ms. Gerken might set an example.\n\n“The Ford Foundation could be a real leader in getting other parts of civil society to start speaking up and pushing back,” she said. “That’s already starting, but there isn’t a clear focal point and she might provide that.”\n\nMs. Gerken said she also took a long view.\n\n“There isn’t just the work of now, of this moment, which is incredibly important,” she said. “We are also going to need to dream a new democracy into existence.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/trump-mamdani-tariffs-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:36:06-05:00","title":"Trump’s Power Faces Pressure Test in Court and at Ballot Box","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is facing a critical convergence of political and legal challenges this week, including a Supreme Court case on the legality of his tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a threat to withhold federal funds from New York City if Zohran Mamdani wins the mayoral election, and an ongoing government shutdown increasingly blamed on him.

in Court and at Ballot Box\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T19:36:06-05:00\n\nPresident Trump is facing major tests of his power and influence this week, with elections that will offer a sense of voters’ moods, a battle over his tariffs at the Supreme Court and a government shutdown that keeps grinding on.\n\nFresh off a trip to Asia and a weekend in Florida, Mr. Trump lashed out on social media on Monday at Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, threatening to withhold federal funds from the city if he wins in Tuesday’s election. The president was also set to appear at virtual rallies for Republicans in New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nHe has said the Supreme Court will be making “one of the most important and consequential decisions ever made” by the nation’s highest court when it considers the legality of his tariffs on Wednesday.\n\nAnd if Mr. Trump continues his standoff with congressional Democrats, by week’s end he will oversee the longest, and potentially most painful, government shutdown in history, one that recent polling shows Americans are increasingly blaming him for.\n\nThe series of events, experts say, has presented Mr. Trump with a pressure test of his go-to governance style — unilateralism — that has marked his second term.\n\n“It’s an odd confluence to have these three potential checks on presidential power — legislative, judicial and electoral — all come in one week,” said Tevi Troy, a presidential historian and senior fellow at theRonald Reagan Institute.\n\n“All these things are systemic challenges to unilateral power,” he added. “What does the Supreme Court do? You can do a lot of things with just the majority in Congress, but there are some things you can’t do — keeping the government open is one of them. And then obviously you need political popularity to carry out a lot of executive actions or unilateralist actions, and an election is a check on presidential popularity.”\n\nIn a statement, the White House sought to downplay the stakes of the week ahead.\n\n“Every week is pivotal when Americans have a president who is all gas, no brakes on his push to Make America Great Again,” said Kush Desai, a White House spokesman.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has indicated that he recognizes the stakes.\n\nBy far the most important day on Mr. Trump’s mind is Wednesday, when the Supreme Court will hear a case challenging whether his use of a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose steep taxes on major U.S. trading partners, was unlawful.\n\nMr. Trump has maintained that the case is one of the most consequential not just of his presidency, but also in the country’s history.

They could potentially breathe new life into lawsuits filed by hundreds of plaintiffs in state and federal courts by families who claim their children developed neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and A.D.H.D., after acetaminophen use during pregnancy.\n\nThe furor has created a public-relations and financial nightmare for Kenvue, a two-year-old spinoff that absorbed Johnson & Johnson’s consumer heath brands. In addition to Tylenol, Kenvue sells other well-known products including Band-Aid, Listerine, Neutrogena and Johnson’s Baby Shampoo.\n\nIn July, Kenvue said it was reviewing its strategy to improve its financial performance. Talks with Kimberly-Clark and other prospective suitors began after that, three people familiar with the negotiations said. Kimberly-Clark had long been interested in Kenvue’s business, given the prestige of brands like Band-Aid, the overlap in target customers and the potential to streamline costs, two of the people said.\n\nThe deal, for $40 billion, was also a bet that the market had overreacted to the risk of more scrutiny from Washington, one of the people said. Amid the uproar about Tylenol and autism, Kenvue’s stock fell 30 percent over the past eight weeks, perhaps making the acquisition more attractive for Kimberly-Clark. The turmoil helped Kimberly-Clark push for a deal that valued Kenvue at a discount to its peers.\n\nKenvue’s stock rebounded slightly on Monday after news of the acquisition.\n\nIt was not immediately clear exactly how the liability in the Tylenol lawsuits will be addressed under the Kimberly-Clark acquisition agreement. Not all of the details were made public, although a typical scenario would be for Kimberly-Clark to inherit responsibility for the litigation.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ lawsuits would certainly carry more weight with the Food and Drug Administration’s decision to seek a warning on the Tylenol label about the connection to neurodevelopmental disorders. An official government warning could depress sales, and Kenvue said it would oppose the labeling changes.\n\nKenvue has repeatedly rejected Mr. Trump’s claims and defended Tylenol’s safety. The company has emphasized the consensus of mainstream medical groups. They have concluded that acetaminophen is the only pain reliever safe for use during pregnancy to treat high fevers, which can pose a danger to the health of the baby and the mother.\n\nThe Kimberly-Clark acquisition stands to give the company more resources to combat litigation and the Trump administration’s actions.\n\nIn a joint statement with Kenvue on Monday, Kimberly-Clark said that in evaluating the acquisition, it “carefully considered all risks and opportunities, working with some of the world’s foremost scientific, regulatory, legal and other experts.”\n\nKimberly-Clark’s stock was down nearly 15 percent at the close on Monday, dropping to its lowest level since 2018. Kenvue’s stock was up 12 percent.\n\nScientists have long studied a potential connection between acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, but research has so far been inconclusive.\n\nSome members of the autism community and supporters of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the nation’s health secretary, have claimed for years that acetaminophen use during pregnancy can cause neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nThe Tylenol-autism lawsuits picked up steam in 2022, but they generated little attention at the time. In August, researchers at Harvard, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and other universities published a scientific review that examined 46 existing studies. They found there was evidence, albeit inconclusive in showing a causal link, of a connection between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nThe issue gained wider attention in early September, when the right-wing provocateur Laura Loomer posted on social media about the issue and the The Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration’s plans to link Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism.\n\nLater that month, Mr. Trump’s startling warning during a news briefing thrust the issue into the public consciousness.\n\nTylenol is the best known among some 600 products containing the active ingredient acetaminophen, an analgesic.\n\nKenvue’s revenue from Tylenol is not publicly disclosed. But even with generic competition, the product generated roughly $1 billion in annual sales for the company, according to an estimate from Morningstar, a financial services firm. That is only a small percentage of Kenvue’s $15.5 billion in revenue last year. Tens of millions of Americans take Tylenol every year, and use by pregnant women represents a mere fraction.\n\n“I don’t think Kimberly is buying Kenvue because of Tylenol,” said Keonhee Kim, a Morningstar analyst. “It’s the appeal of the overall portfolio, rather than a specific brand.”\n\nStill, he said, “the depressed stock price definitely makes the deal a lot more attractive.”\n\nOther major companies have faced a legal firestorm after acquiring a troubled product. In 2018, Bayer, the giant German chemical and pharmaceutical company, bought Monsanto, the maker of the well-known weedkiller Roundup. Bayer became financially responsible for claims that the herbicide caused cancer, paying billions of dollars to settle thousands of claims.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/durango-colorado-ice-protester.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"18:00:15-05:00","title":"An Altercation With ICE Prompts a Police Chief to Push Back","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Durango, Colorado, a protest erupted after ICE arrested a Colombian family on their way to school, with residents uniting in civic resistance.

the video of an immigration agent putting a protester into what the chief saw as a chokehold and throwing her down an embankment.\n\nImmigration agents had arrested a Colombian man and his two children on their way to school last week, provoking a furious response from this liberal college town of 20,000 in the mountains of southwest Colorado. Dozens of residents — many with their arms linked — descended on the small Immigration and Customs Enforcement building where the family was being held, set up camp outside the razor-wire gates and tried to block authorities from removing the family from Durango.\n\nWhat set the protest apart from similar clashes between residents and immigration agents in Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities was Chief Current’s determination that the masked federal agent involved in the scuffle had crossed a line and his request for an investigation. He said he even considered filing criminal charges himself against the agent.\n\n“It appeared to be an out-of-policy and possibly illegal use of force,” he said in an interview at police headquarters.\n\nThe scene from Durango, captured by fellow protesters and put on social media, was violent and jarring, but no more so than many others across the country. Several protesters, including elected officials and a Democratic congressional candidate, have been arrested or charged with federal crimes at immigration detention centers. American citizens have been whisked into unmarked vehicles and charged with resisting arrest or attacking officers, though the people arrested have maintained they did no such thing.\n\nProtesters, journalists and clergy have sued over federal agents’ use of tear gas and crowd-control munitions against protesters.

An afternoon rally at Dodger Stadium was sold out.\n\nThe event was a catharsis in a year that began with wildfires that devastated much of the region, including the Los Angeles enclave of Pacific Palisades and the community of Altadena, and erupted again this summer with an onslaught of raids by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. By the time baseball season ended, protests had left downtown Los Angeles half-covered in anti-ICE graffiti and thousands of National Guard troops had come and gone from Southern California.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the Dodgers’s victory over the Toronto Blue Jays in a grueling 7-game World Series was a kind of metaphor for Southern California’s own perseverance. Like the city of Los Angeles itself, the team is a multicultural juggernaut with people from all over the world.\n\n“When people in Los Angeles look at the Dodgers, they’re looking in the mirror,” said Zev Yaroslavsky, a former longtime Los Angeles County supervisor and city councilman. “It’s more than just wins and losses and strikes and balls.”\n\nDuring the immigration raids, as the team’s owners struggled to balance the fury of its heavily Latino fan base against the perils of angering the White House, some Latino fans briefly pushed for a boycott. On Monday, that Latino fan base turned out in force.\n\n“ICE knows if they try to come in here, they’ll never get out,” Nick Plasencia, 64, a Lyft driver from Eagle Rock joked as the crowd jostled.\n\nBrian Vega, 31, a construction worker from the Los Angeles suburb of Maywood, said he woke up early to bring his wife and four children downtown to see the Dodgers. His mind was on his father, who had been deported to Mexico in April. Aunts and uncles, Dodger fans all, missed the parade, too, out of fear of ICE agents, he said.\n\n“If they could be here,” Mr. Vega said, “they would.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/world/europe/halloween-party-canceled-russia.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"15:03:37-05:00","title":"Halloween Becomes Another Target of the Kremlin’s Culture Wars","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Russian government has canceled and suppressed a Halloween event in St. Petersburg called Nekro Comic Con, branding it as 'Satanist' and arresting its organizer.

Instead, it became the latest casualty of Russia’s culture wars.

He spoke on condition that only his first name be used given the scrutiny of the event and Russia’s criminalization of what it deems to be satanism.\n\nAs Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on, the Kremlin is increasingly trying to define itself in contrast to the West. The Russian authorities have sought to crack down on social events in conflict with the Kremlin’s conservative worldview, said Alexander Verkhovsky, the director of the Moscow-based SOVA Center, which researches the relationship between religion and society.

Its Economy From the West Years Ago\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T11:21:06-05:00\n\nPresident Trump has used tariffs to try to reduce American reliance on Chinese exports and prevent China’s factory overcapacity from swamping the United States economy. But his effort has hit an obstacle: Beijing was already well on its way to weaning its economy from the United States.\n\nFor two decades, China has systematically pursued economic self-reliance. China has been able to establish choke points to pressure the U.S. economy, while making it harder for Washington to block China.\n\nSelf-reliance has been a cornerstone of Chinese policymaking not just under Xi Jinping, the country’s top leader since 2012, but also under his predecessor, Hu Jintao.\n\nTheir program of replacing imported manufactured goods with domestic production has been costly and often inefficient. But it has left the West with dwindling leverage it can deploy during disputes.\n\nChina’s leaders have become increasingly public about emphasizing the self-reliance drive. It took a prominent place at an annual gathering of the Communist Party’s Central Committee last month, when the country’s top officials laid out a sketch of China’s next five-year plan.\n\n“We must first and foremost intensify efforts toward achieving greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology,” Mr. Xi said in a speech.\n\nThis year, China has wielded one of its most powerful choke points — its almost complete control over the world’s supply of rare earth metals and rare earth magnets.\n\nFaced with restrictions on China’s supply of rare earths, Mr. Trump last week accepted a compromise with Mr. Xi.\n\nTheir agreement left this year’s new U.S. tariffs for China similar to those for countries in Southeast Asia and lower than the tariffs for countries like India and Brazil, with which the United States has traditionally maintained closer relations.\n\nChina’s threat to put extremely tight controls on its rare earth exports also helped persuade the Trump administration to suspend a policy it adopted in September to expand the number of military-related Chinese companies that Americans are not allowed to do business with.\n\nChina has gained other choke points through its policies of manufacturing self-reliance. It is the world’s dominant producer of the ingredients needed to make antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals. It is also the main producer of a lot of electrical equipment, low-end computer chips and much more.\n\nThe United States has been left with fewer options when it needs to fight back. When Washington wanted to pressure Beijing to back down on rare earth export controls, the Trump administration threatened to restrict some of the last categories of crucial American exports that China still needs, like aircraft parts.\n\nChinese officials are now calling for their country to become even more self-reliant.\n\n“A comprehensive industrial system benefits the enhanced resilience of supply chains,” Tian Peiyan, one of Xi Jinping’s senior policy advisers, wrote in a journal over the weekend. He added that a very broad industrial base could create “a bulwark of economic security.”\n\nWhen China joined the World Trade Organization at the end of 2001, it depended on imports for a wide range of goods. The cars, telecommunications gear, power generation equipment and other manufactured goods that China made then were inferior to imports, prompting many Chinese companies and consumers to prefer imports.\n\nSince then, China has made enormous strides in the quality and quantity of these and many other goods.\n\n“Among 500 major industrial products, my country ranks first globally in the production of over 220,” Jin Zhuanglong, a prominent Chinese engineer, said last year when was minister of industry and information technology.\n\nLast month’s Central Committee gathering, or plenum, ordered that China would, starting next year, double down on its emphasis on advanced manufacturing. The plenum document ordered government and business to “work faster to boost China’s strength in manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, and cyberspace.”\n\nBeijing has combined the vast scale of its manufacturing operations with considerable state direction. Only a handful of business sectors are left in which American and European industries still lead the world, notably commercial aircraft and a few of the most advanced semiconductors.\n\n“President Xi has been quite good at finding ways to engineer American imports out of China’s supply chains over time, apart from the most advanced semiconductors designed but not made by U.S. firms,” said Brad Setser, a China specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nDespite more than a decade of heavy public investment, China lags in making the fastest semiconductors, needed for artificial intelligence and the latest military technologies. But Chinese companies have proved adept at buying and smuggling Nvidia microchips.\n\nChina’s policies to replace imports with domestic products have included the Indigenous Innovation campaign adopted soon after China joined the W.T.O., Made in China 2025 starting in 2015, and the effort called “high quality productive forces” in the past two years.\n\nThe state-controlled banking system has lent heavily at low interest rates to manufacturers of electric cars and solar panels, and China has become the largest exporter of these goods.\n\nFor some products, China has achieved self-reliance with protectionist trade policies. Since 2008, China has used tariffs and fees that more than double the sticker prices of imported cars and sport utility vehicles with large gasoline engines.\n\nThat has not only discouraged imports but has meant that Chinese consumers never became accustomed to powerful and bulky vehicles. This is one reason they have been quick to switch over to electric cars and hybrid gasoline-electric cars, which together now comprise more than half the Chinese market.\n\nSince early in Mr. Trump’s first term, American officials tended to dismiss concerns that China might use the choke points it was developing. To do so would damage China’s credibility as a destination for foreign investment, they argued, and would prompt multinationals to shift their purchases elsewhere.\n\nThat could yet happen. But China’s leaders, as shown last month, seemed determined to pursue even greater self-reliance.\n\nThe plenum’s closing statement said, “We must consolidate and expand our advantages, break through bottlenecks and constraints, and strengthen our shortcomings and weaknesses.”\n\nChris Buckley contributed reporting and Li You contributed research.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/opinion/trump-china-trade-tariffs.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:00:05-05:00","title":"Trump’s China Trade Policy Is a Hot Mess","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article critiques Donald Trump’s approach to U.S.-China trade policy, arguing that his chaotic and short-sighted tariff policies have failed to produce meaningful results.

2025-11-03T17:00:05-05:00\n\nAs a real estate developer, Donald Trump is deeply familiar with the three keys to success in that industry: location, location and location. Geopolitics, it turns out, also has three keys to success: leverage, leverage and leverage. But it’s not the kind of leverage (i.e., debt) that Trump loved to use in real estate. It’s geopolitical leverage — the power to impose your will on your adversary.\n\nSeen from that point of view, Trump succeeded in bringing about a cease-fire in Gaza because he gained leverage over both Israel and Hamas — and he used it adroitly. He has failed to bring about a cease-fire in Ukraine, because he has refused to use all the leverage he has on Russia’s Vladimir Putin, who started the war. And Trump’s attempts to employ the leverage of tariffs to reduce China’s manufacturing exports to America — more necessary today than ever — has shown only limited gains largely because of the chaotic way Trump has gone about putting those tariffs into place.\n\nOf course, Trump, with his usual bluster, scored his recent meeting with President Xi Jinping of China as a grand slam — “a 12” on a scale of 0-10, as he put it. In fact, at this summit, all Trump did was dig himself out of a hole with China that he himself dug a few months ago. As The Wall Street Journal noted, markets “yawned” at the deal because it “mostly restores the status quo that prevailed in May.”\n\nSo, if you’re keeping score at home, Trump is batting one for three — or .333. In baseball, that can get you into the All-Star Game. In the game of nations, it gets you sent down to the minor leagues.\n\nWhy .333? Let’s focus on China, which is the most important geostrategic, geoeconomic issue for America today.\n\nAny analysis of China has to start with the fact that as a result of the devastating bursting of China’s housing bubble over the last few years, millions of Chinese have lost significant amounts of money and become burdened with debt. Not surprisingly, they are scrimping on spending. I am told that many of the half-empty restaurants I saw in Beijing and Shanghai when I was there last March are even worse off today.\n\nIn short, the world’s second largest economy is having a crash in domestic consumption, so Chinese are also importing even less from abroad. Beijing’s response is not to stimulate domestic consumption — by giving its people something more than the bare minimums in social security and health care — but instead to fund the building of more factories to export goods to the rest of the world.\n\nAs one of my Times colleagues covering China, Chris Buckley, reported last week: “Days before meeting President Trump in South Korea, the Chinese leader Xi Jinping laid out the next stage in a strategy of long-term competition with the United States and the West.” The plan “makes clear that Beijing wants to double down” on industrial manufacturing “even as its trading partners worry that China’s expanding exports are undercutting their own industries.”\n\nThis is utterly reckless on China’s part. As another of my Times colleagues, Keith Bradsher, reported from Beijing last January, China already “produces about a third of the world’s manufactured goods.” That “is more than the United States, Japan, Germany, South Korea and Britain combined.”\n\nSo Trump is responding to a real problem. But as he so often does, he is pushing the wrong answer to the right question. To have real leverage, his tariffs must be part of a quiet grand strategy, but Trump’s fire-ready-aim strategy has been anything but that.\n\nFor starters, if you want to move China, you don’t do it in a loud, haphazard way that is only going to embarrass its leaders and get their backs up. You have long secret negotiations.\n\nSecond, if you are going to threaten Beijing with economic sanctions, you had better know what it can threaten you with. I can’t confirm this, but I suspect that Trump started announcing his new tariffs on China without ever asking any expert whether China could retaliate in any meaningful way — aside from stopping purchases of American soybeans.\n\nI assume Trump did not ask this, because if he actually knew beforehand that President Xi had an economic weapon that could trump Trump’s tariffs tenfold, it would have been the height of foolishness to impose the huge 145 percent tariff rate on all imports from China that Trump did at one point.\n\nThat weapon was China’s control of 69 percent of the market share for the mining of the 17 chemical elements known as rare earths, 92 percent of the share for the refining of those elements and 98 percent of rare-earth-based magnet manufacturing, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs. Rare earths are used in all sorts of technologies, but rare-earth-based magnets are essential for most electric vehicle motors, semiconductors, smartphones, M.R.I. machines, drones, radars, fighter jets, missiles and offshore wind turbines.\n\nHad China gone ahead with its order to curtail rare earth exports in response to Trump’s tariffs, it could have significantly slowed down or shut down manufacturing all across America — and the world.\n\nWhen Xi laid that card on the table, Trump’s leverage was sharply diminished. He quickly scrambled to have his Treasury secretary persuade China to postpone its curbs on rare earth exports for a year by offering to sharply lower U.S. tariffs and postpone some new bans on high-tech exports to Beijing.\n\nThis was the geoeconomic version of Mike Tyson’s famous dictum that everyone has a plan until he gets punched in the mouth.\n\nFinally, I repeat, Trump was right to impose tariffs across the board on Chinese imports in his first term — and also now — because China has not been playing fair on trade. It is forcing U.S. companies to compete with Chinese factories heavily subsidized by the government, and that are greatly overproducing manufactured goods for export. Tariffs that are limited in time can be useful in buying the economic running room for American manufacturers to develop their own homegrown replacement industries. But for that you need to have a comprehensive strategy — and Trump has none.\n\nAt a time when American companies are trying to compete with China’s advanced manufacturing exports, Trump is actually making it harder for U.S. firms to hire high-skilled workers from abroad. He has imposed tariffs that make the materials that go into steel more expensive for our manufacturers; he has slashed the very government-funded research essential for us to compete with China, let alone stay ahead of it; and he has imposed tariffs on virtually all of America’s key allies, whose backing we need to create leverage on China through collective action. It’s a completely incoherent strategy.\n\nAll this said, Xi may have leverage today, but he, too, is playing a risky game. By going nuclear on trade — that is, threatening to curtail rare earth exports — Xi has freaked out the rest of the world and stimulated the U.S. and other key economies to begin a crash program to replace these critical Chinese exports. It will take a long time, but the process has begun.\n\nMore broadly, the rest of the world is simply not going to let China take all the manufacturing jobs, especially as A.I. starts to cut increasingly into blue-collar and white-collar work. China is courting a real global backlash.\n\nGiven how important the U.S.-China relationship has been for sustaining the relative Great Power peace and prosperity of the world since the late 1970s, Washington and Beijing need a quiet long-term dialogue — not a noisy long-term trade war in which both sides lose.\n\nIf we really are heading for a divorce in this relationship, oh my goodness, we will miss it when it’s gone.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

They are more marathon than sprint. It is a euphemism to describe him as deliberate. If you have an interview with Mr. Irving, 83, set aside several hours, if not days.\n\n“Make sure you have time,” said Dr. Marty Schwartz, a physician with a family practice in Toronto and a longtime friend of Mr. Irving’s. “When he starts to tell you something, you can see it being written as if it were a book in his head.”\n\nThe words do not spill forth like tidal waves. Rather, Mr. Irving produces them in a slow but continuous drip. In the process, he takes possession of conversations. He has the road map, and there are detours — heavily layered anecdotes and memories that do not lend themselves to newspaper profiles, an inconvenience that is not lost on Mr. Irving, whose 16th novel, “Queen Esther,” a sprawling work of historical fiction, comes out this week.\n\n“I feel like I’m leaving you with a mess to sort out later,” he said during a recent interview at his home office in Toronto.\n\nConsider: A question about whether Mr. Irving had already started working on another novel merely cleared the runway for a 45-minute monologue that touched on his research methods, his interactions with tattoo artists and retired gynecologists, his proficiency in German, and his 1981 trip to Israel at the invitation of the Jerusalem International Book Fair. It was in Israel, he said, that he met with a botanist and Holocaust survivor who had figured out how to grow asparagus in the desert.\n\nLater, over dinner at a nearby pub that he frequents, he elucidated on the purpose of thin-soled wrestling shoes — “You’re supposed to be able to feel the mat,” said Mr. Irving, whose lifelong connection to wrestling, in his personal life and his novels, led to his induction into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame — before segueing into a story about how, many years ago, he invited Twyla Tharp, the dancer and choreographer, to Harvard, where he was moonlighting with the men’s wrestling team as a volunteer assistant. Ms. Tharp visited practice and even participated in some drills with the team’s lightweights.\n\n“They were, of course, sort of thrilled to have a woman to throw around,” Mr. Irving said. “The third day, she went out there and said to one of them: ‘OK, I picked up a few things. My turn.’ And sure enough, she hit a perfect double-leg on this guy, picked him up by both cheeks and threw him onto his back. The old coach — he was a great guy — said: ‘Jesus Christ! She’d be a hell of a 123-pounder!’”\n\nA human nesting doll, Mr. Irving is a lot like many of his novels. There are stories within stories, and he is as uncompromising as his work.\n\nFor over 60 years, he has championed in his pages the experiences of so-called outsiders — orphans and dwarfs, lesbians and prostitutes, addicts and artists — and he remains fiercely protective of them and all the nuanced expressions of humanity they represent. So protective, in fact, that he will not visit the United States to promote “Queen Esther,” a decision he described as a protest of President Trump and his administration’s policies.\n\n“I could not, would not, in good conscience go to my birth country,” Mr. Irving said, “when there is such an authoritarian bully in the White House, and when the craven Republicans in the House and the U.S. Senate are complicit in their silence.”\n\nSince 2015, Mr. Irving has been a full-time resident of Toronto, where he lives with his wife, Janet Turnbull Irving. (He became a dual citizen in 2019.) His work space in their condominium has panoramic views — on a clear day, he can catch a glimpse of Lake Ontario — and enough real estate on the walls for dozens of framed pictures, many of them of his three adult children.\n\nAmong the countless books in his office are several copies of “The World According to Garp,” the 1978 novel that vaulted Mr. Irving to stardom — he landed on the cover of Time magazine in 1981 — and established him as a prescient voice for the marginalized. One of the novel’s central figures, a former professional football player named Roberta Muldoon, is a transgender woman, which was a fairly radical concept at the time.\n\n“People would say to him, in a critical way, that his characters are so outlandish and outrageous that it’s kind of hard to swallow,” Dr. Schwartz said. “And he would say: ‘You think my characters are hard to swallow? Read the newspapers, you idiot.’”\n\nMr. Irving, who has the stocky build of a former athlete, is partial to flannel shirts and running sneakers, as if he were always ready for a workout. He subscribes to exactly one magazine, Amateur Wrestling News. It was his experience as a high school and college wrestler, he said, that instilled in him the sort of work ethic he needed to succeed as a novelist.\n\n“Writing is rewriting and rethinking,” he said. “And you can’t learn to wrestle without doing it again and again and again, until it’s an instinct, until it’s a reflex.”\n\nMr. Irving sticks to the same routine, seven days a week. When he is not traveling or being interviewed, he gets up between 7:30 and 8:15 a.m., then watches the television news and looks over the newspaper while he eats breakfast. At around 9:30 a.m., he stations himself at a long desk where he spends the next eight hours writing. He used to write by hand, but arthritis in his fingers — a consequence of old wrestling injuries — has relegated him to typing on a computer. He is not happy about this development.\n\n“Technology is not my friend,” he said.\n\nAfter that, he takes a walk or hops on the treadmill, then does some weight lifting and stretching before dinner.\n\nThe novelist Ron Hansen, a friend and former student of Mr. Irving’s at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, described Mr. Irving’s “industry” as one of his defining traits, an unyielding sense of discipline that has enabled him to write prolifically, and well into his 80s.\n\nThere is a story about this, because there are always stories about Mr. Irving — even when he is not telling them himself. Several years ago, Mr. Irving invited Mr. Hansen to watch the Super Bowl at his apartment in New York, where they were joined by Mr. Irving’s Swedish publisher. Mr. Irving spent most of the evening answering correspondence. Mr. Hansen watched the game with the Swedish publisher.\n\n“He has this Dickensian way of being able to write in company,” Mr. Hansen said. “He once told me that he taught himself to write with his sons around, because otherwise he wouldn’t get the writing done.”\n\nAnother story: Back when Mr. Hansen was studying at Iowa and living in Mr. Irving’s basement, something happened in the kitchen that knocked out the power. Mr. Irving rumbled down the stairs to the basement and, unaware of Mr. Hansen’s presence, glared at the fuse box as if it had caused great personal offense.\n\n“I JUST WANT TO WRITE!” he shouted.\n\nAll these years later, Mr. Irving acknowledged that the slow creep of mortality had affected how he approached his work. It was within the last decade that he began to prioritize the projects he felt were the most difficult — those outside his personal experience that would require more research and time — and save his easier, more straightforward ideas for later.\n\nHe sometimes dwells on the many hours he has spent writing screenplays and adapting his books for television and film, often frustrating endeavors that have drawn him away from his novels. Even the most rewarding of them — “The Cider House Rules,” for which Mr. Irving won an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay — went through four directors before it was released in 1999.\n\nMr. Irving still gets annoyed when he sees the movie poster, which happens frequently since one is up in his home office. It shows Tobey Maguire, the film’s star, giving Charlize Theron, his love interest, a piggyback ride, their smiles as wide as the Hollywood sign.\n\n“Oh, I was so mad,” Mr. Irving said. “It’s an abortion story, not a love story. I didn’t want to see Charlize Theron riding around on Tobey Maguire’s back. I wanted to see a curette and an enamel basin — a bloody one.”\n\nEven now, he said, he has six properties in development for film and TV. It’s good to be in demand, right?\n\n“Or,” he said, “you could look at that, at the age of 83, and say, ‘Boy, have you been wasting your time.’”\n\nSome reviewers have been less than charitable with Mr. Irving’s more recent work.\n\nThe New York Times, for example, critiqued “The Last Chairlift,” which was published in 2022, as “an unrelenting avalanche of words from which one emerges blinking and dazed — a book to be not so much read as survived.” Similarly, The Guardian assessed “Avenue of Mysteries,” his 2015 novel, as “meandering.” (The Times called it “exhausting.”)\n\n“Sometimes, members of my family try to hide them from me,” Mr. Irving said of negative reviews. “Or Jonathan Karp, my wonderful editor, he’ll say, ‘If you were thinking of reading The New York Review of Books next week, don’t.’”\n\nMr. Irving went on to explain, in his own way, why he did not heed their advice, first by drawing on his experience as a wrestling coach. In the same way that he liked to know other wrestlers’ tendencies, he read reviews to learn “who doesn’t like you and why,” he said.\n\nHe then cited Camus, or at least he thought it was Camus. It might have been someone else. “One of those French guys whose writing wasn’t terribly impressive to me,” he said. Anyway, the point was that one of them once said something about how negative feedback was important because it meant you had done something original.\n\n“If it gets under their skin, keep doing it,” Mr. Irving said.\n\nCriticism is inherently subjective, of course, and many have continued to praise Mr. Irving’s knack for invention and his willingness — sense of obligation, even — to tackle, with the full force of his literary weight, volatile subject matter.\n\nThat trend continues with “Queen Esther,” which, among other things, takes on Jewish identity, antisemitism and sexuality. Also, as if to reinforce that he is still fearless, Mr. Irving devotes several pages to the histories of both abortion and male circumcision.\n\nYet, because Mr. Irving’s newer books exist in the shadow cast by his megahits of yore, comparisons are unavoidable, and the power of his productivity may work against him, too.\n\n“I was remembering that quote about E.M. Forster, that his reputation improved with every book that he didn’t write,” Mr. Hansen said. “John is just the opposite. He keeps writing books, and it’s almost like the wrestling model: You don’t know if you’re going to win every match, but you go out there and try and see what happens.”\n\nUnlike Mr. Forster, who stopped writing novels in his 40s and lived to 91, Mr. Irving continues to write — and, in fact, cannot stop.\n\n“He sits down at the same time every day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, and writes,” Dr. Schwartz said. “It’s what he does.”\n\nMr. Hansen sees that as a virtue. “It’s like a scientist who continues to do experiments,” he said. “John is still experimenting, still growing, still trying to figure out the craft.”\n\nIn some ways, Mr. Irving’s work space has a museum quality, with so many old books and old photos, some friends now gone, and even a few portraits of himself as a younger man. He pointed to one. “Back when I actually had an aquiline nose — how strange,” he said, wistful for the days before wrestling forever altered it.\n\nHe is still pugnacious, but slightly more open to compromise. He recently told Mr. Hansen that his next novel — which, yes, he has already started — would be shorter than most of his others.\n\n“Maybe only 400 pages,” Mr. Hansen said.\n\nRead by Scott Cacciola\n\nAudio produced by Tally Abecassis.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/business/starbucks-china-boyu-capital.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:18:33-05:00","title":"Starbucks to Sell 60% of Its China Business to a Private Equity Firm","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Starbucks has agreed to sell up to 60% of its China retail operations to private equity firm Boyu Capital in a $4 billion deal, forming a joint venture to operate nearly 8,000 stores.

2025-11-03T19:18:33-05:00\n\nStarbucks said on Monday that it had agreed to sell up to 60 percent of its retail operations in China to Boyu Capital, a private equity firm, in a deal valued at $4 billion.\n\nThe agreement states that Boyu and Starbucks would operate its nearly 8,000 stores there under a joint venture. Starbucks will own and license its brand and intellectual property to the new entity, according to a statement.\n\nStarbucks said it expected the value of its retail business in China to exceed $13 billion, which includes the proceeds from the sale, the company’s remaining 40 percent stake and the expected value of licensing fees over the next decade.\n\n“This approach allows us to combine the strength of the Starbucks brand, our coffee expertise, the third place and our unique partner culture with Boyu’s deep knowledge of the China market and local expertise,” Brian Niccol, Starbucks’s chief executive, said in a statement.\n\nMr. Niccol added that the joint venture agreement would be completed in early 2026. Boyu has offices in Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing.\n\nChina has been a big bet for Starbucks going back decades.\n\nStarbucks opened its first shop in China in 1999, at a time when tea dominated and a coffee culture was practically nonexistent. But as China’s middle class grew and aspired for iPhones, Louis Vuitton handbags and other international brands to signal its newfound wealth, Starbucks flourished.\n\nToday, China is Starbucks’s second-largest market, accounting for about 8 percent of revenue. At the end of June, there were 7,828 stores in China, compared with 17,230 in the United States.\n\nBut in recent years, consumers in China have increasingly turned away from foreign brands as they have become more cost conscious and curious about local rivals.\n\nA number of Chinese chains like Luckin Coffee, ChaGee and HeyTea flooded the region, offering coconut milk lattes, boba milk teas with cheese cream and sugary jasmine tea frappés, often with significant promotions.\n\nFor Starbucks, which has resisted entering a price war on lattes and cold brew coffees, same-store sales over the last couple of years have weakened, as has its share of the Chinese market.\n\nMr. Niccol has spent much of his first year as chief executive of Starbucks trying to bolster the chain’s business in the United States. While he has said the turnaround is happening, the company’s stock has fallen 17 percent in the past year. In late September, the company abruptly said it was laying off 900 members of its corporate staff and shuttering more than 600 stores that it said were underperforming.\n\nLast month, Starbucks reported its quarterly global revenue rose 5.5 percent from a year earlier, to $9.6 billion. But its net income dropped 85 percent to $133 million.\n\nBut Starbucks’s struggles in China are another significant test for Mr. Niccol. Last year, he told Wall Street analysts that the company needed to “figure out how we grow in the market now and into the future” in China. That growth could come with the help of a strategic partner, he added.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/opinion/nick-fuentes-kirk-successor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:36:00-05:00","title":"Nick Fuentes Was Charlie Kirk’s Bitter Enemy.

Now He’s Becoming His Successor.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T19:36:40-05:00\n\nCharlie Kirk, the conservative influencer who was assassinated in September, and Nick Fuentes, the young Hitler-loving white nationalist at the center of a growing schism on the right, were bitter enemies.\n\nFuentes despised Kirk for his support of Israel, and, more broadly, for his efforts to marginalize Fuentes’s gleefully racist and fascist brand of politics. In 2019, seeking to expose Kirk as “anti-white” and a “fake patriot,” Fuentes organized his army of young fans — known as Groypers, after a variant on the alt-right Pepe the Frog meme — to flood events held by Kirk’s organization, Turning Point, and ask hostile questions. At one, they drove Donald Trump Jr. off the stage.\n\nAfter Kirk was murdered, Fuentes, perhaps fearing he’d be blamed, disavowed violence. But he continued his attacks on Turning Point and accused Kirk’s widow, Erika, of being happy her husband was dead. “I am getting this vibe from her that she’s very fake,” he said.\n\nEven as Fuentes defamed Kirk’s widow, powerful conservatives were engaged in a nationwide campaign to canonize Kirk and destroy progressives who maligned him. Guest-hosting Kirk’s podcast, JD Vance urged listeners to report anyone celebrating Kirk’s death to their employers. In such an atmosphere, one might think that Fuentes’s stock on the right would have fallen. Instead, it’s risen higher than ever, revealing a seemingly unstoppable ratchet of radicalization on the right.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Fuentes’s ideology, he helpfully distilled it on his streaming show, “America First,” in March. “Jews are running society, women need to shut up,” he said, using an obscenity. “Blacks need to be imprisoned for the most part.” His sneering, proudly transgressive attitude has made him a hero to legions of mostly young men who resent all forms of political gatekeeping. The conservative writer Rod Dreher, a close friend of Vance, warned, “I am told by someone in a position to know that something like 30 to 40 percent of D.C. G.O.P. staffers under the age of 30 are Groypers.” The figure is impossible to check, but it captures a widespread sense that Fuentes’s politics are ascendant.\n\nPlenty of conservatives, especially Jewish ones, abhor Fuentes’s growing clout. But by cheering on Donald Trump as he promoted conspiracy theories and systematically destroyed bulwarks against nativism and bigotry in the Republican Party, they helped make Fuentes’s rise possible.\n\nFuentes reached a career high last week when he was invited onto Tucker Carlson’s podcast, one of the most popular shows in the country. Carlson gently took issue with a few things Fuentes has said, especially the idea that Jews as a whole are responsible for the sins of Israel and neoconservatism. “I feel like going on about ‘the Jews’ helps the neocons,” Carlson said at one point. But their two-hour conversation was overwhelmingly friendly. Carlson seemed to presume that they were on the same side; his disagreements with Fuentes were mostly about means, not ends.\n\nConservatives who detest antisemitism were shaken by the interview. They were even more alarmed when Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation — long a bastion of the conservative establishment — defended Carlson. “The Heritage Foundation didn’t become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians,” he said in a video, describing Carlson’s critics as a “venomous coalition” who are “sowing division.”\n\nThese comments led to an uproar among some of Heritage’s donors, staff members and supporters, and Roberts attempted to quell it by denouncing Fuentes. But he still seems to think that Carlson was right to give him a hearing. In a message to the Heritage staff obtained by National Review, Roberts rejected “censorship and purity tests,” writing, “Canceling one person today guarantees the purge of many tomorrow.”\n\nRoberts is not against cancel culture in principle; he cheered Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension from ABC for his comments about Kirk’s murder. But he’s very much opposed to the cancellation of conservatives, no matter how extreme, and he’s not alone. On much of the MAGA right, attempts to impose taboos have themselves become the ultimate taboo. This stance is summed up by the phrase “no enemies to the right,” which has become common enough in MAGA world that it’s sometimes written as an acronym, NETTR.\n\nFor decades, mainstream conservatives spoke proudly of how William F. Buckley Jr., the founding editor of National Review, excommunicated the paranoiac and reactionary John Birch Society from the conservative movement. The story of Buckley’s cordon sanitaire was always a bit of a myth; the border between respectable conservatism and the far-right demimonde remained quite permeable. But it was a helpful myth, since it valorized a willingness to draw lines.\n\nTrump all but annihilated that willingness, and many MAGA intellectuals now see Buckley’s quarantine as a mistake. Laura Field, in her excellent new book “Furious Minds: The Making of the MAGA New Right,” quotes the writer and activist Charles Haywood calling Buckley a “Judas” who “led the American Right into a box canyon, swiftly spiking any gun that seemed as if it might be effective in the war waged by the Left on decent America for over a hundred years.”\n\nNot all conservatives embrace the idea of “no enemies to the right” — Dreher has written powerfully against it — but it’s become a significant current in our politics. When Politico reported that several Young Republican leaders took part in a racist group chat that included praise for Hitler, some in the party were appalled, and a few of the participants lost their jobs. But Vance defended them as “kids” whose lives shouldn’t ruined for telling jokes. (Some were in their 30s). Within certain MAGA circles, to criticize someone for being too racist or reactionary is a betrayal, signaling an acceptance of the very liberal morality that the movement’s vanguard seeks to destroy.\n\nKirk, who came of age in the pre-Trump conservative movement, was still sometimes willing to police boundaries. But in the wake of his killing, there’s surprisingly little sense on the right that that part of his legacy should be upheld. Rather, prominent voices insist that Kirk’s murder necessitates the final loosening of all remaining restraints. “I cannot ‘unite’ with the left because they want me dead,” the influential podcaster Matt Walsh posted after Kirk’s death. “But I will unite with anyone on the right.”\n\nAdrian Vermeule, the Harvard law professor who has helped create the intellectual foundation for the post-liberal right, put it more elegantly this weekend, as the fight over Carlson, Fuentes and Roberts roiled conservatives. “History records many cases in which cities fell to siege because, even with the enemy at the very gates, factions within the city could not put aside their mutual struggle for domination,” he wrote on social media. Lest there be any doubt about which factions he was scolding, he made it clear in a subsequent post: “I’ll be resolutely ignoring the views of those who profess a certain ‘conservatism’ but who have never actually challenged the liberal consensus on anything that might endanger their careers.”\n\nVermeule is a cultivated man who, as Field writes, is part of a movement that “thinks it has a monopoly on things like ‘the true, the good and the beautiful.’” Yet however lofty his rhetoric, its moral logic leads inexorably to Groyperism, and the elevation of Fuentes, Kirk’s foe, into his successor.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

I have goose bumps,” said Ms. Khadu, whose son, Stephan Khadu, 24, had died four years ago after being held on the barge, a floating jail docked in the water across the East River from the Rikers Island jail complex.\n\nThe 625-foot blue-and-white barge, known officially as the Vernon C. Bain Center, and more unofficially as The Boat, has been sold by New York City to a Louisiana scrap company. On Monday the buyer came to pick it up from this industrial edge of the South Bronx and begin towing it south for recycling.\n\n“It’s been a dagger in my heart since he died, but I know he is dancing in joy today,” Ms. Khadu said of her son, shortly before workers began casting the lines off the five-story vessel, thought to be the country’s only floating jail when it was decommissioned in 2023.\n\nShe and other former detainees and their loved ones had turned out to watch the barge be taken away.\n\n“It represents the end to so much pain and trauma,” said Edith Mayfield, whose husband, Marvin Mayfield, had been locked up on the boat for 11 months under “unbearable conditions” in 2008, then lobbied for years to have it closed, before dying in 2023.\n\nThe Bain Center, which opened in 1992 and was decommissioned in 2023, stretched the length of two football fields and was roughly five stories in height. Today it looks something like a container ship stacked with cargo.\n\nIt had an 800-inmate capacity and was the last of a handful of floating jails used by New York City in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a temporary remedy to address a soaring prison population fueled by the crack cocaine epidemic. It opened just as the city’s jail population, which was then above 20,000, was beginning to decline.\n\nThe barge was problematic from the start, having arrived as New York City’s most expensive jail of the day, at a cost of more than $160 million.

Some developed seasickness from the rocking waves and would ask to be taken to the infirmary for Dramamine.\n\nPlus, he said, “It was cold every month of the year.”\n\n“It was like a slave ship,” said Mr. Santana. “Basically everyone in there was Black and brown,” he said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/briefing/food-stamps-tylenol-maker-margaret-atwood.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:56:15-05:00","title":"The Trump Administration Plans to Offer Only Partial Food Stamp Benefits","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration announced that it would provide only partial food stamp (SNAP) benefits to the approximately 42 million Americans who receive the program during a government shutdown, following federal court rulings that deemed the prior refusal to pay unlawful.

Only Partial Food Stamp Benefits\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T17:56:15-05:00\n\nThe Trump administration said today that it would send partial payments this month to the roughly 42 million Americans who receive food stamps. Officials announced the plan after a pair of federal judges said the government had acted unlawfully by initially refusing to pay for the food aid during the government shutdown.\n\nIt is unclear, however, when food stamp recipients will receive the funds or whether it will be enough for some families. The administration opted against using its full stable of available funds to sustain the program in full, and eligible households may receive only half as much in benefits compared with their usual amounts, officials said. Administration officials have said that partial payments could take weeks to arrive.\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, is the largest of a handful of federal safety-net programs that are running out of funds while Congress has seemed to make no real effort to end to the shutdown. A nutrition program for low-income women and children received an additional $450 million from the Trump administration.\n\nFor more: Houses of worship are trying to step in to feed hungry Americans.\n\nIn other administration news: President Trump pardoned the crypto billionaire Changpeng Zhao last month. In an interview with “60 Minutes” last night, Trump claimed that he didn’t know who Zhao was.\n\nMillions of Americans will head to the polls tomorrow. Two new governors will be elected: In Virginia, the Democrat, Abigail Spanberger, leads in polls by a healthy margin; in New Jersey, where the race appears highly competitive, Democrats are hoping to maintain their early-voting advantage.\n\nOn the other side of the country, California is voting on a ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional district lines. It’s Democrats’ response to Trump’s effort to tilt maps around the country.\n\nIn New York, mayoral candidates made their closing argument to voters.\n\nFor more on politics:\n\n“Political scores” are ratings that many Americans don’t even know they have.\n\nHere’s what a future of extreme gerrymandering could look like.\n\nKimberly-Clark, the consumer products giant that owns Kleenex and Huggies, said today that it agreed to spend about $40 billion to buy Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol. For the last couple of months, Kenvue has been fighting unproven claims by the Trump administration that link the common pain reliever to autism.\n\nAcquisition talks were underway before the president criticized Tylenol. But the turmoil helped pushed Kenvue’s stock price down, giving Kimberly-Clark an opportunity to bet that the market overreacted.\n\nSince the city of El Fasher in Sudan’s Darfur region fell to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces last week, images and witness accounts have showed a massacre taking place — with echoes of the genocidal violence that defined the region two decades ago. Tens of thousands of people have tried to escape, but relatively few have made it to the nearest aid zone.\n\nMany who escaped there arrived with bullet wounds and signs of torture. In accounts shared with The Times, survivors described scenes of horror: “There were bodies of men and women everywhere — some people were run over by vehicles,” said Saeeda, a 28-year-old woman who fled. “While we were on the road, they took girls from our group — choosing them and dragging them away.”\n\nJamaica: Hurricane Melissa destroyed 90 percent of the homes in Black River.

shot last week by an immigration agent in Southern California are disputing the account given by federal officials who charged him with assault.\n\nThe lawyers for Carlos Jimenez, 25, said on Monday that he was a bystander asking federal agents to move away from a bus stop where schoolchildren would soon be gathering. At the time, the immigration officers had stopped a vehicle near the bus stop in Ontario, Calif., about 40 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Jimenez, a U.S. citizen, said he was later shot in the shoulder as he drove away from federal agents, but said that he did not try to use his vehicle to harm anyone.\n\nFederal prosecutors, however, said last week in a criminal complaint that an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer shot Mr. Jimenez because he pulled forward, turned his wheels and “rapidly accelerated” toward an officer during the vehicle stop on Thursday.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said on Monday that at about 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning, Mr. Jimenez drove up to a team of immigration officers overseeing a vehicle stop. He then “engaged in a verbal altercation with the officers,” according to the criminal complaint filed against him, and officers ordered him to leave.\n\nMr. Jimenez reversed his car toward them and “an ICE officer, fearing for his life, fired defensive shots at the vehicle,” she said.\n\nHe was charged on Friday with assault of a federal officer following the incident. He was released on bond.\n\nThe altercation was the latest high-profile incident in which federal agents fired shots at drivers whom they accused of endangering them during immigration enforcement operations.\n\nLast month, a Mexican man targeted by immigration authorities was injured by gunfire during an operation in Los Angeles. In September, during a traffic stop in Chicago, an ICE agent shot and killed a man who authorities said had hit an officer with his car. A New York Times examination of video from the scene called into question elements of the official D.H.S. account of the encounter.\n\nMs. McLaughlin called the most recent incident an example of  increasing threats that ICE officers face “as they risk their lives to enforce the law and arrest criminals.” She said that anyone who gets in the way of federal officers’ duties or threatens them will be arrested and prosecuted.\n\nMr. Jimenez’s lawyers told a very different story.\n\nThey described him, in an interview on Monday, as a father of three young children who lives in a mobile home park near where the officers were conducting their stop. He was headed to his job at a food bank, where he prepares and delivers donation boxes, when he noticed the officers blocking traffic, said Cynthia Santiago, one of his lawyers.\n\nMr. Jimenez pulled over to ask the officers if they could clear the street and move away from a nearby bus stop where children would soon be showing up to go to school, his lawyers said.\n\nFederal officials and Mr. Jimenez’s lawyers agree that a federal officer approached Mr. Jimenez’s driver’s side window with a gun in hand, and then retrieved pepper spray. And they agree that Mr. Jimenez quickly reversed his vehicle.\n\nFederal officials said that it appeared Mr. Jimenez was trying to drive toward an officer behind him to potentially cause harm. But Mr. Jimenez’s lawyers said that he was trying to get around the law enforcement vehicles so he could leave, and that officers shot him as he was driving away from them.\n\n“He has to back up to get around the vehicles and around the police cars,” said Robert Simon, one of his lawyers. “They shoot him as he’s driving south, driving away.”\n\nMr. Simon shared photos of Mr. Jimenez’s car that show the bullet that struck Mr. Jimenez’s shoulder pierced the back passenger window of his car. That suggests Mr. Jimenez had already begun driving away and that the officers were behind him when one fired at him, the lawyers said.\n\n“None of these facts line up,” Ms. Santiago said. “The aggressiveness and the violence used against our communities for people with or without status is pretty evident, and it just seems that they’re using our communities as training grounds.”\n\nMr. Jimenez’s is scheduled to return to court on Nov. 25.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/arts/music/donna-jean-godchaux-grateful-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"15:56:55-05:00","title":"Donna Jean Godchaux-MacKay, Grateful Dead Singer, Dies at 78","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donna Jean Godchaux-MacKay, a renowned singer and former member of the Grateful Dead, died at 78 in Nashville.

Jean Godchaux-MacKay, Grateful Dead Singer, Dies at 78\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T15:56:35-05:00\n\nDonna Jean Godchaux-MacKay, a singer who performed on hits such as “When a Man Loves a Woman” by Percy Sledge and helped shape the sound of the Grateful Dead in the 1970s, died on Sunday in Nashville. She was 78.\n\nThe cause of her death, in hospice care, was cancer, her publicist, Dennis McNally, said in a statement.\n\nAfter more than a decade as a session musician, Ms. Godchaux-MacKay, an Alabama native, joined the Grateful Dead in the early 1970s, after the freewheeling, improvisational band from the Bay Area had firmly established itself as a group that reflected the idealism of the 1960s.\n\nBefore joining the group, Ms. Godchaux-MacKay had been an established session musician, mostly in Muscle Shoals, Ala., singing behind Elvis Presley on “In the Ghetto” and “Suspicious Minds.” In 1970, she moved to San Francisco, where many younger people were flocking to restart. As first, she was skeptical of her friends’ ravings about the Dead.\n\n“That ragged sound?” Ms. Godchaux-MacKay recalled in a 2007 interview with The Baltimore Sun. “I didn’t think they could play. I figured, ‘These guys must be good-looking.’ So I checked the back of one of their album covers and went, ‘Nope, that’s not it.’”\n\nBut soon after arriving, she caught a performance by the Dead at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco.\n\n“To them, music was an adventure, like something spiritual,” she told The Sun. “I’d never heard anything like that. I thought, ‘This is what I want to do.’”\n\nShe was married to a jazz pianist, Keith Godchaux, who found out that Jerry Garcia, the band’s frontman, was playing at a nightclub. The couple approached Mr. Garcia, who gave them his phone number.\n\n“I can’t believe the chutzpah we had,” Ms. Godchaux-MacKay told The Sun. “I didn’t know people did that to him all the time. But Jerry just always had his antennas up.”\n\nWithin days, they were in the band, forging a relationship that would last the rest of the decade. Ms. Godchaux-MacKay helped shape several of the Dead’s most famous songs, including “Eyes of the World” and “Playing in the Band,” one live performance of which exceeded 46 minutes.\n\nBut the collaboration wasn’t always smooth. At times, Ms. Godchaux-MacKay struggled to fit into the group’s eclectic sound, especially while sharing vocals with other members, including Mr. Garcia, Phil Lesh and Bob Weir. She and her husband left the band in 1979 — a parting that Ms. Godchaux-MacKay described as “very mutual” in a 2011 interview with The Poughkeepsie Journal. The next year, in 1980, Mr. Godchaux died in a car accident.\n\nMs. Godchaux-MacKay remained active musically after leaving the Dead. She married David MacKay, a bassist, in 1981, with whom she started the Donna Jean Godchaux Band. He survives her, as do her sons Kinsman MacKay and Zion Godchaux; a sister, Gogi Clark, and a brother, Ivan Thatcher.\n\nDonna Jean Thatcher was born on Aug. 22, 1947, in Florence, Ala., to Chet Thatcher, a flight instructor, and Jamie Jeffreys, a computer skills teacher.\n\nIn 1994, Ms. Godchaux-MacKay was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Dead. Later, she appeared periodically onstage with some of her former bandmates, including with Dead & Company, the offshoot of the band, in 2016.\n\n“I was flying to San Francisco to do a show with Phil and listening to ‘Ripple’ through my headset, when I just started sobbing. The music still touched me deeply,” Ms. Godchaux-MacKay told The Edmonton Journal in 2008, referring to Mr. Lesh.\n\nMs. Godchaux-MacKay also appeared with or started other groups, including Donna Jean and the Tricksters, which was a spinoff of the Zen Tricksters, a Long Island-based Grateful Dead tribute band.\n\nWhile many of her best-known contributions were to the discography of the Dead, Ms. Godchaux-MacKay’s work in the studio left an indelible mark on the music of a other hitmakers, including Dionne Warwick, Cher, Neil Diamond, Ben E. King and Boz Scaggs.\n\n“When I was 12, I started hanging out at the studios,” she told The Poughkeepsie Journal. “I just knew that’s what I was going to do. I was going to sing, come hell or high water.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/business/listeria-outbreak-trader-joes-kroger.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:58:48-05:00","title":"Six Dead in Listeria Outbreak Linked to Pasta","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A listeria outbreak linked to contaminated pasta meals sold at major grocery chains such as Albertsons, Kroger, Sprouts, and Trader Joe’s resulted in six deaths and 27 cases across 18 states.

died after eating prepared pasta meals that were contaminated with listeria and sold at major grocery chains across the country, federal health officials said.\n\nThe meals, sold at Albertsons, Kroger, Sprouts Farmers Market, Trader Joe’s and other major stores, were recalled in recent months in connection with the outbreak, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said grew last week. Federal health officials said the supplier, Nate’s Fine Foods Inc., had found Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that can cause illness and death, in a sample of its pasta.\n\nHealth officials said that a total of 27 people in 18 states had been affected by the outbreak, and that they were working to investigate the source.\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\nThe meals, which included fettuccine, linguine, farfalle and other types of pasta, were sold at major retailers nationwide and were recalled between June and October.\n\nOf the 27 people who became ill, 25 were hospitalized, health officials said. Many of them reported eating precooked meals. In one case, a pregnant woman lost her fetus after becoming ill, health officials said.\n\nThe cases were reported in California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington.\n\n“When it comes to listeria outbreaks, this one’s fairly significant and large,” said Benjamin Chapman, a food safety specialist who is the head of the agricultural and human sciences department at North Carolina State University. The number of deaths linked to the outbreak is “tragic,” he added.\n\nIn a statement on Sep. 29, Nate’s Fine Foods said that it was “committed to the highest standards of food safety,” and that it was working with the C.D.C., the Food and Drug Administration and state health officials to “fully investigate the source.”\n\nListeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that is found naturally in soil, water and animals and can end up in food during the harvesting, processing, preparing and packaging process. It thrives in unsanitary conditions, and it cannot be killed by the cold conditions in a fridge or a freezer.\n\nWhen people eat food contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes, they may develop a disease called listeriosis, though many do not become seriously ill. Pets can also spread it if they eat contaminated food.\n\nAccording to the C.D.C., about 1,250 people are infected with listeria each year in the United States, and about 172 die from the infection. The agency describes it as the third leading cause of death from food-borne illness in the country.\n\nIn February, about two million baked goods, including some doughnuts and coffee rolls sold at Dunkin’, were recalled over concerns of listeria contamination. The same month, frozen shakes sold to nursing homes, hospitals and other institutions were recalled after the drinks were tied to a yearslong deadly listeria outbreak.\n\nLast year, 10 people died and more than 60 people were sickened after a listeria outbreak that was linked to a Boar’s Head deli meat plant in Virginia. Boar’s Head permanently shut down the plant last September.\n\nMany people infected with listeria have mild illness and will recover on their own after a few days of symptoms, which include diarrhea, vomiting and fever. Others may not get sick at all.\n\nBut listeria can be very dangerous for people who are pregnant or over 65 or have weakened immune systems. For people in these groups, listeria can more easily spread from the intestines to the blood and cause serious illness.\n\nPregnant women with listeria infections typically experience fever, muscle aches and fatigue. Even if these symptoms are mild, infections can lead to miscarriage, premature birth or life-threatening infections in newborn babies.\n\nOther people with serious infections may have flulike symptoms, as well as headaches, stiff necks, confusion, trouble with balance or convulsions.\n\nFor those who consume food contaminated with listeria, symptoms can appear the same day or take as many as 10 weeks to develop. But they usually begin within about two weeks, according to the C.D.C.\n\nHealth officials are warning people who may have purchased any of the recalled products to check their refrigerators and freezers for the meals — and not to eat them.\n\nIt’s also wise to clean refrigerators, containers and any other surfaces that the affected foods may have touched; listeria can survive in the fridge and easily spread to other foods and surfaces.\n\nAnyone with symptoms should contact a doctor and report them to the F.D.A.\n\n"}]}
