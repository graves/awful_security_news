As of 2021, more than a quarter of the Maldives’ adult population (aged 15 to 69) used tobacco, according to a  national survey . That rate was almost double for young teens aged 13 to 15.\n \n\n   \n  By comparison, close to 20% of adults in the  United States  used tobacco in 2022, and almost 12% of adults in the  United Kingdom  were smokers in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Though the Maldives is the first country to enact such a ban, similar proposals have been debated – and nearly imposed – in other parts of the world.\n \n\n   \n  New Zealand came close to imposing something similar in 2022, when the government passed a world-leading smoking ban that would have prohibited the sale of tobacco to anyone born after January 1, 2009.\n \n\n   \n  But the ban, which was supposed to go into effect in 2024, never came to fruition. Just a year after the bill was passed,  it was rolled back  to help pay for tax cuts – infuriating public health officials and anti-tobacco groups.\n \n\n   \n  Similar bills were proposed in Britain in recent years but failed to pass;  a new version  is now making its way through parliament. The bill would ban tobacco for anyone born after January 1, 2009, and strengthen regulations on the sale of tobacco and vaping products.\n \n\n   \n  A number of British health leaders signed  an open letter  last week calling for the bill’s passage, and decrying delays in the process so far. In the six months since the bill’s last debate in parliament, more than 120,000 young adults have started smoking, claimed the letter, signed by the leaders of major hospitals, cancer charities, and branches of the National Health Service (NHS).\n \n\n   \n  The Maldives ban is just the latest in the country’s years-long effort to crack down on tobacco and smoking – including electronic cigarettes.\n \n\n   \n  The government  banned  the import, possession, use, manufacturing and distribution of all vapes in the Maldives in late 2024, regardless of age.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities are now hoping to cut down on smoking everywhere across the archipelago, with plans to set up  anti-smoking clinics t hat will offer medication to help people quit tobacco products.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this summer, the president even  proposed a cash reward  for residents on any island that completely eliminates smoking.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/sport/nascar-cup-series-championship-larson-hamlin","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:28:00+00:00","title":"Kyle Larson outlasts Denny Hamlin to win second career NASCAR Cup Series championship","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kyle Larson wins his second NASCAR Cup Series championship in 2025 by edging out Denny Hamlin in a dramatic final race at Phoenix Raceway.

By Jacob Lev, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:28 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The final race of the 2025 NASCAR Cup Series season came down to the wire with  Kyle Larson  beating out Denny Hamlin to secure his second career Cup Series championship at Phoenix Raceway in Avondale, Arizona on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Larson was one of the four drivers including Hamlin, Chase Briscoe and William Byron in contention for the title, but Larson managed to finish in third position, ahead of the other three contenders to claim the championship.\n \n\n   \n  The race came with some drama as a late caution sent the finale into overtime.\n \n\n   \n  The 44-year-old Hamlin, who was looking to finally achieve glory after making his NASCAR debut in 2004, found himself three laps away from the win when Byron got a flat tire and hit the wall alongside the track to bring out the caution.\n \n\n   \n  The Joe Gibbs Racing driver, Hamlin, then went to pit for four new tires while Hendrick Motorsports’ Larson only got two which placed him in fifth position ahead of Hamlin, who was in 10th.\n \n\n   \n  With not enough time in the race, Hamlin finished in sixth as Ryan Blaney, who was eliminated from title contention last week, took the checkered flag.\n \n\n   \n  It is the second championship for the 33-year-old in 11 seasons. Larson won his  first title in 2021  when he joined Hendrick Motorsports.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, I can’t believe it. We didn’t lead a lap today and somehow won the championship,” Larson told the NBC broadcast after the race. “Really, I’m just speechless. I can’t believe it. We had an average car at best.”\n \n\n   \n  An emotionless Hamlin sat in his car, wiping his face with a towel as Larson celebrated with his team. After some time, Hamlin emerged from his car and was greeted by his Joe Gibbs Racing teammates, relishing the fact his sixth attempt at a title wasted away despite leading 208 of the 319 laps after starting on the pole.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing I could do different. I mean, prepared as good as I could coming into the weekend and my team gave me a fantastic car,” Hamlin said. “Just didn’t work out. I was just praying ‘no caution’ and we had one there. What can you do? It’s just not meant to be.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamlin said his crew chief made the right call with the tires and reiterated that the team did a “fantastic job” while sounding defeated on his future chances.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll try. I got a couple more shots at it but man, if you can’t win that one, I don’t know which one you can win,” Hamlin added.\n \n\n   \n  Larson, the only Asian American to race full-time in NASCAR, has not won a race since May, totaling 24 consecutive races but thanked his crew chief Cliff Daniels for keeping the team together.\n \n\n   \n  “Unbelievable! What a year by Hendrick Motorsports team. Cliff Daniels, everybody,” Larson said. “His leadership – his complete leadership just showed that whole race. Keep us all motivated. Always having a plan and all that. So, thats the story of our season.”\n \n\n   \n  Briscoe finished in 18th with Byron coming in 33rd after the late issue.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/mississippi-woman-kills-escaped-monkey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-05:00","title":"Mississippi woman kills escaped research monkey fearing for her children’s safety","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, a rhesus monkey escaped from a truck that overturned on Interstate 59 near Heidelberg, Mississippi.

research monkey fearing for her children’s safety \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:05 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   Heidelberg, Mississippi (AP) —  One of the monkeys that  escaped last week  after a truck overturned on a Mississippi roadway was shot and killed early Sunday by a homeowner who says she feared for the safety of her children.\n \n\n   \n  Jessica Bond Ferguson said she was alerted early Sunday by her 16-year-old son, who said he thought he had seen a monkey running in the yard outside their home near Heidelberg, Mississippi. She got out bed, grabbed her firearm and her cellphone and stepped outside where she saw the monkey about 60 feet away.\n \n\n   \n  Bond Ferguson said she and other residents had been warned that the escaped monkeys carried diseases so she fired her gun.\n \n\n   \n  “I did what any other mother would do to protect her children,” Bond Ferguson, who has five children ranging in age from 4 to 16, told The Associated Press. “I shot at it and it just stood there, and I shot again, and he backed up and that’s when he fell.”\n \n\n   \n  The Jasper County Sheriff’s Office confirmed in a social media post that a homeowner had found one of the monkeys on their property Sunday morning but said the office didn’t have any details. The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks took possession of the monkey, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Before Bond Ferguson had gone out the door, she had called the police and was told to keep an eye on the monkey. But she said worried that if the monkey got away it would threaten children at another house.\n \n\n   \n  “If it attacked somebody’s kid, and I could have stopped it, that would be a lot on me,” said Bond Ferguson, a 35-year-old professional chef. “It’s kind of scary and dangerous that they are running around, and people have kids playing in their yards.”\n \n\n   \n  The Rhesus monkeys had been housed at the Tulane University National Biomedical Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, which routinely provides primates to scientific research organizations, according to the university. In a statement last week, Tulane said the monkeys do not belong to the university, and they were not being transported by the university.\n \n\n   \n  A truck carrying the monkeys overturned Tuesday on Interstate 59 north of Heidelberg. Of 21 the monkeys in the truck, 13 were found at the scene of the accident and arrived at their original destination last week, according to Tulane. Another five were killed in the hunt for them and three remained on the loose before Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The Mississippi Highway Patrol has said it was investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred about 100 miles from the state capital, Jackson.\n \n\n   \n  Rhesus monkeys typically weigh about 16 pounds and are among the most medically studied animals on the planet. Video recorded after the crash showed monkeys crawling through tall grass beside the interstate, where wooden crates labeled “live animals” were crumpled and strewn about.\n \n\n   \n  Jasper County Sheriff Randy Johnson had said Tulane officials reported the monkeys were not infectious, despite initial reports by the truck’s occupants warning that the monkeys were dangerous and harboring various diseases. Nonetheless, Johnson said the monkeys still needed to be “neutralized” because of their aggressive nature.\n \n\n   \n  The monkeys had recently received checkups confirming they were pathogen-free, Tulane said in a statement Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Rhesus macaques “are known to be aggressive,” according to the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. It said the agency’s conservation workers were working with sheriff’s officials in the search for the animals.\n \n\n   \n  The search comes about one year after  43 Rhesus macaques escaped  from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research because an employee didn’t fully lock an enclosure. Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, had set up traps to capture them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/dearborn-fbi-raid-terror-attack-skepticism","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"FBI Thwarts Alleged Terror Plot in Dearborn, Michigan — Community Skeptical of Claims","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI claimed to have thwarted a potential terrorist attack in Dearborn, Michigan, during Halloween, citing arrests and a raid on a home.

But the community’s residents are skeptical \n       \n  By Alaa Elassar, Leigh Waldman, Jeff Winter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Before dawn the morning of Halloween, residents of a quaint, tree-lined Michigan neighborhood were jolted awake by the blasts of detonated smoke bombs and a voice shouting in Arabic.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the FBI. We have a warrant. All residents inside … come out with nothing in your hands,” a man yelled before armed federal agents stormed the home in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, FBI Director Kash Patel  boasted on X  the agency had “thwarted a potential terrorist attack” and arrested “multiple” people in Dearborn “allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  Considered to be the heart of Arab America, Dearborn is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States and has frequently faced Islamophobic and hateful remarks.  Abdullah Hammoud , the son of Lebanese immigrants, became the first Arab American mayor of Dearborn when he was elected in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the community, including neighbors and attorneys for the people taken into custody, say they are skeptical of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  One of these neighbors is Laraib Irfan, who says his Dearborn community is a close-knit, peaceful place where everyone looks out for each other like family.\n \n\n   \n  Irfan was woken up Friday morning by his sister, telling him the FBI agents were outside. He heard two bangs he described as so loud they sounded like bombs and gunfire.\n \n\n   \n  He watched in shock as FBI agents surrounded the house two doors away from his. To his knowledge, the house was home to a family of seven — a mother, father and five sons.\n \n\n   \n  At the sound of the FBI’s command, the residents stepped out of their home with their hands behind their backs, Irfan said. For hours afterward, agents filed in and out, carrying materials to gather evidence, as Michigan State Police cordoned off the surrounding streets, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others questioned, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case told CNN on Friday; their ages range from 16 to no more than 29. Amir Makled, who represents one of the people arrested in the alleged plot, told CNN on Sunday three people were arrested and two were questioned. CNN has reached out to the FBI for clarification.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI has not released the names of those arrested. CNN has not been able to confirm whether all those suspected of being connected to the raid have legal representation.\n \n\n   \n  But as of Sunday evening, the people taken into custody still have not been charged with any crime, Makled said, a detail attorneys say speaks volumes.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The two law enforcement sources told CNN about a reference to “pumpkin day,” an online chat about an ISIS-inspired attack and a shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s, but actual details of the alleged plot are scarce.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Hussein Bazzi, who says he is representing another one of the people arrested following the raid, told CNN the “pumpkin day” reference may have been “online gamer chat that was misinterpreted.”\n \n\n   \n  “I have no information that’s been provided to me by the government or anybody else that there was a plot that was planned, discussed or intended to be carried out,” Bazzi said.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI told CNN it was conducting law enforcement activities in the cities of Dearborn and nearby Inkster, Michigan, but has not responded to CNN’s request for additional comment.    \n \n\n   \n    Lack of charges and hesitancy to release information is ‘concerning’\n \n\n   \n  Patel’s initial X post applauded the FBI for “crushing our mission to defend the homeland,” yet he gave no explanation or evidence to support claims of a foiled terrorist plot.\n \n\n   \n  “More details to come,” he wrote — but so far, none has been alleged.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI has not released any additional information, offering no clarity on when, where or how the alleged plot was meant to unfold.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s curious to me,” Colin Clarke, a domestic terrorism and international security expert, told CNN. “What it makes me think is that the plot wasn’t maybe as mature as they led people to believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke, executive director of the security research nonprofit The Soufan Center, says authorities may be holding back details to protect a potential prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re waiting to comment on it so they don’t go out and say anything that ends up hurting them in a court case,” said Clarke, who has no direct knowledge of the investigation. “Or there’s not much to this, the plot, there wasn’t much there.”\n \n\n   \n  Only time will reveal the full story, he said. The delay in charges often depends on how long the FBI has been tracking an alleged plot. His central concern, he added, is whether the claim the plot was inspired by ISIS has any basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Was there an actual ISIS operative communicating with these individuals, or were they just communicating with one another?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But for Dearborn’s community, the prolonged silence from authorities is raising serious concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “An allegation like this is dangerous to this community,” Makled said. “So when you have the national director of the FBI putting out a statement that there was a thwarted terrorist attack and then the news covers the raids of homes in the city of Dearborn, immediately the backlash on the internet is homegrown terrorist cell.”\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the raid posted on  Facebook  sparked bigoted comments: “A real shocker that they reside in Dearborn,” one person wrote. “Well, Dearborn does have a major Islamic population who aren’t exactly friendly to anyone else,” said another. Some accused the people in the home of being “sleeper cells.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Dearborn’s large Arab population, which makes up nearly half the city, makes it an easy target for Islamophobic, racist comments, the city has been ranked the second-safest large city in Michigan, according to the FBI’s  2024 annual crime report .\n \n\n   \n  “This community has been part of the state of Michigan for generations,” Makled, a Lebanese American and lifelong Dearborn resident, said. “They’re deeply ingrained in the American fabric here and this community, they’re sick and tired of being held to a different standard.”\n \n\n   \n  A neighbor, who asked to only be identified as “Ahmed,” said the people who lived in the home were kind, and he was not convinced the raid was based on credible suspicion.\n \n\n   \n  “You never hear anything from them, they are perfect, smiling, and I do not believe anything happened (from them), they are very good people,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the FBI’s claim they stopped a terrorist plot, Ahmed interrupts and rejects the possibility completely: “No, no, no, no,” he says. “I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   \n  Another neighbor, Kathy Sisson, also speaks highly of her community; she says she’s disabled and her neighbors, who are from Brazil, Pakistan and Iraq, are constantly checking on her to make sure she’s OK.\n \n\n   \n  A person in the home where the FBI activity took place who did not want to share their name told CNN the people taken into custody “were just kids” and the situation was “being blown out of proportion and shouldn’t have happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke warned against hasty conclusions but expressed skepticism that officials could credibly claim a foiled terrorist plot without clear, compelling evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “For the administration to come out and say they thwarted a plot, I feel like they (would need) stronger evidence than just a bunch of teenagers talking sh*t in a chat room,” Clarke said.\n \n\n   \n  Makled said his client’s mother has not stopped crying.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that my client has stopped thinking or slept for one second since the moment he’s been taken into custody because of how deeply concerned he is about what the future is bringing,” he said. “He has no control in terms of what the federal government is going to say about him.”\n \n\n   \n    Muslim American communities are exhausted\n \n\n   \n  For many, the incident harks back to the post-9/11 era, when Arab Americans were routinely subjected to false stereotypes, covert surveillance, unequal restrictions and, all too often, threats from people who were violent and driven by hate.\n \n\n   \n  “I know what went on after 9/11 and how our Arab and Muslim communities felt after that,” Clarke said. “Of course they’re under the microscope, even with the New York City  mayor’s race , you see a lot of Islamophobia kind of rearing its head again. We just don’t know.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the attack on the Twin Towers in New York, the FBI has prevented  numerous  suspected terrorist attacks by running undercover operations, where agents say they have infiltrated extremist networks to catch people who would have committed crimes.\n \n\n   \n  However, Muslims have often borne the brunt of racialized state surveillance. Many were suspected of domestic terrorism, through everyday actions that were disproportionately scrutinized and subjected to FBI attention solely because of their faith, according to a  2018 study published in Critical Sociology  examining patterns of surveillance targeting Muslim communities.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to be targeted and always looked at with a sense of suspicion. Dearborn’s used to this,” Makled said. “This community doesn’t want to be held in that light of suspicion anymore, and it doesn’t deserve to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Michigan chapter of the Council on American–Islamic Relations criticized the FBI’s lack of transparency and the fact that no charges have been filed. Executive Director Dawud Walid stressed that, no matter what the investigation uncovers, Muslims in Dearborn and across the US do not owe anyone an apology for the actions of others.\n \n\n   \n  “People in the community are getting tired of this idea of collective guilt, or somehow we have to answer for the alleged actions of a couple of people,” Walid told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Makled urged the public to withhold judgment and wait for the results of the investigation before making assumptions about the community as additional details from the FBI are still pending.\n \n\n   \n  If Patel put out a statement prematurely, “I would demand an apology from the national director,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how you create unity,” he added. “And that’s how you cure any error or harm that was caused by a mistake. This community is very forgiving, and we would accept that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/portland-oregon-national-guard-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"11:56:00-05:00","title":"Federal Judge Extends Order Blocking Trump from Deploying National Guard Troops to Portland","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Karin Immergut, has extended her order blocking President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, citing a lack of legal justification and violations of state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment.

A federal court last month  blocked the deployment  of National Guard troops in Chicago. And last week the  Supreme Court  took the rare step of asking for additional briefing in that high-profile case.\n \n\n   \n  National Guard troops have been staging at Portland training bases for weeks while the legal case plays out, having been activated to protect federal officials and an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has been the focal point of daily protests since June.\n \n\n   \n  Federal attorneys have argued it’s within Trump’s presidential authority to respond to the daily protests outside the facility that have subjected the building and its agents to what it described as coordinated violence.\n \n\n   \n  But state and city attorneys called the move “one of the most significant infringements” on Oregon’s sovereignty in the state’s history and argued the Trump administration is dramatically misrepresenting the situation and risking inflaming tensions.\n \n\n   \n  Immergut’s order says the federal government was unable to show that the situation in Portland was out of control or that federal officers were unable to do their jobs\n \n\n   \n  “Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President’s federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,” her order reads.\n \n\n   \n  Immergut preliminarily   ruled that the federal government’s deployment of the National Guard in Oregon exceeded its legal authority, violated the Tenth Amendment by infringing on state sovereignty, did not meet the legal definition of a “rebellion,” and caused ongoing constitutional harm that justified immediate judicial intervention.\n \n\n   \n  She noted the trial testimony “included evidence of sporadic isolated instances of violent behavior toward federal officers and property damage to a single building,” but those incidents do not appear to be backed by an “organized group engaged in armed hostilities for the purpose of overtaking an instrumentality of government by unlawful or antidemocratic means.”\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of violence that did occur during this time period involved violence between protesters and counter-protesters and isolated sporadic incidents of low-level unlawful conduct,” the order read.\n \n\n   \n  The order from Immergut – whom Trump appointed during his first term – is expected to draw a quick appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a separate  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  decision allowing Trump to deploy the Oregon National Guard troops to Portland is being reconsidered “en banc” by a broader 11-judge panel.  That case revolves around a now-frozen second order from Immergut that blocked the deployment of troops from Oregon. A date for the hearing was not set.\n \n\n   \n  While  400 soldiers  from Oregon and California together were federalized and sent to the greater Portland area, a Trump administration lawyer  said  in a previous hearing before the Ninth Circuit that the administration didn’t plan to deploy more than 200.\n \n\n   \n  Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued on September 28 after Trump declared he was sending National Guard troops to the city, and Immergut’s  two temporary orders  blocking those efforts closely followed.\n \n\n   \n  Then, the three-judge Ninth Circuit panel on October 20 issued a stay on Immergut’s first restraining order — a ruling that could have paved the way for a deployment as the legal battle played out. But the decision to have a new set of appeals judges rehear the case meant that the Trump administration was still barred from deploying troops.\n \n\n   \n    Insights and surprises from the trial\n \n\n   \n  The October trial Immergut presided over featured a surprising revelation: National Guard troops were on the ground at Portland’s ICE facility earlier last month even after the judge ordered them not to show up.\n \n\n   \n  Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton argued it took time to implement the order. “My clients were working to end the mission,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The trial also provided insight on what federal and National Guard officials knew – and didn’t know – when Trump called for hundreds of troops to protect the ICE facility.\n \n\n   \n  Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, a deputy regional director for the Federal Protective Service, identified in court by the initials R.C., said.\n \n\n   \n  Testifying in court, R.C. stated he and his boss, the FPS regional director, were “surprised” by the order, which they had learned about on the news.   \n \n\n   \n  A fundamental disagreement from the trial was over how extreme the demonstrations were – and whether local law enforcement can handle them.\n \n\n   \n  State and city attorneys argued a simmering protest scene only ramped up after Trump ordered Guard troops to enter Portland in late September, and while there had been “sporadic and inexcusable crimes” along with peaceful protests, they were nothing existing law enforcement couldn’t handle.\n \n\n   \n  For months, the Trump administration has argued that federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters which justifies a more forceful response.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court. Protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence, he said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/worst-weekend-air-traffic-control-staff-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"03:20:00-05:00","title":"Worst Weekend for Air Traffic Controller Staffing Since Start of Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the ongoing federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, air traffic control operations in the United States faced their worst staffing shortages since the shutdown started, with 98 FAA facilities reporting 'staffing triggers' over the weekend of November 1–3.

November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Flight delays linked to the  ongoing federal government shutdown  continue, with this past weekend marking the worst for air traffic control staffing shortages since the shutdown began, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Aviation Administration operations plans.\n \n\n   \n  Between Friday morning and Sunday night, 98 FAA facilities reported a “staffing trigger,” meaning air traffic controllers had to alter operations to keep the airspace safe with fewer people working.\n \n\n   \n  The alterations can include rerouting planes or delaying flights when there are not enough controllers to handle the normal workload.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers are considered  essential staff  and must work during the government shutdown, despite not getting paid. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said some controllers have called in sick in protest while others are taking time off to work other jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Not every staffing shortage results in a delay, as controllers can reroute flights, but sometimes there is no choice but to slow planes down to maintain safety.\n \n\n   \n  Friday, which was Halloween, saw 46 facilities impacted by staffing shortages. On Saturday, 34 facilities were short staffed and on Sunday, the number was 18.\n \n\n   \n  Control towers in Austin, Texas; Newark, New Jersey; Boston, Dallas, Denver, Nashville and Phoenix were all short staffed at some point over the weekend. Shifts of controllers who deal with flights enroute at high altitude, and other controllers who handle approaching and departing airports were also short staffed.\n \n\n   \n  The team that manages flights headed to Newark Liberty International Airport reported more staffing triggers than any other single operation.\n \n\n   \n  A “surge” in controllers calling out on Halloween “strained” staffing at half of the  30 largest airports  in the country,  according to the FAA . Nearly 80% of air traffic controllers were out Friday at facilities in the New York City area.\n \n\n   \n  “Air traffic controllers are under immense stress and fatigue. The shutdown must end so that these controllers receive the pay they’ve earned, and travelers can avoid further disruptions and delays,” the  FAA said  Friday.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown, which began October 1, enters its second month, “it’s only going to get worse,” Duffy said Sunday on  CBS’ “Face the Nation.”  “Does it become a flight emergency, a safety issue? No, we will stop traffic. So, we’re not going to let that happen. I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of the shutdown, 393 facilities have reported a staffing trigger – roughly four times as many as were reported on the same dates last year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/japan-takaichi-north-korea-kim-jong-un-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:08:00-04:00","title":"Japan’s New Prime Minister Takaichi Wants to Meet Kim Jong Un to Resolve Abduction Crisis","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has announced a desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a move that marks the first such initiative by a Japanese leader in over 20 years.

North Korea’s Kim Jong Un \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, Junko Ogura, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:08 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Japan’s  new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said she wants to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un – something no Japanese leader has done in more than 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  “We have already conveyed to North Korea our desire to hold a summit meeting,” Takaichi said Monday at a rally demanding the return of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea decades ago.\n \n\n   \n  The issue is one of the unresolved pain points between the two neighbors divided by sea, whose long history of colonization and conflict has doomed previous attempts at bilateral talks.\n \n\n   \n  “I want the leaders to face each other directly and achieve concrete results,” Takaichi said. “I am determined to break through and resolve the abduction issue during my tenure.”\n \n\n   \n  Japan says  at least 17 of its citizens were snatched  by North Korean agents in the late 1970s and 1980s. Five citizens were returned in 2002. The abductions appear to have been part of North Korea’s espionage program, according to a  2014 UN report. \n \n\n   \n  Pyongyang disputes the total number taken and says some died in traffic and drowning accidents, as well as suicide, and it considers the matter over.\n \n\n   \n  But for the families of Japanese abductees who remain missing, some of whom were just teenagers when they were taken, there has been no closure or relief. They, along with Japan’s revolving door of leaders over the years, have continued pressing the issue with little success.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi has met with the abductees’ families twice since taking office, including once with US President Donald Trump during his visit to Japan. She has previously said she’s committed to completing the mission of her mentor, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who introduced the abductees’ families to Trump during the US president’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  The two countries held an unprecedented summit in 2002, with Japan’s then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visiting the North Korean capital Pyongyang to meet Kim Jong Il – the father of now-leader Kim Jong Un.\n \n\n   \n  That visit was  the first time  a Japanese prime minister visited North Korea since the end of WWII.\n \n\n   \n  It was also the first time North Korea acknowledged its role in the abductions, after many years of denial. Kim Jong Il offered an apology at the time, saying the agents responsible had been punished, and promised to prevent it happening again, according to Japanese  government statements  at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The five detainees were returned to Japan the following month and reunited with their families – 20 to 30 years after their abduction.\n \n\n   \n  Koizumi returned to North Korea to meet Kim Jong Il a second time in 2004, during which the family members of several abductees were also allowed to return to Japan.\n \n\n   \n  No further repatriations have happened since then – and no progress has been made in talks between the two countries, despite repeated efforts by successive governments.\n \n\n   \n  Abe, who was assassinated in 2022, had  signaled a willingness  to meet Kim Jong Un without conditions to improve ties between their countries; several years later, then-leader Fumio Kishida also  conveyed his intention  to meet the North Korean leader.\n \n\n   \n  Each time, a meeting failed to materialize. Now Takaichi, who took office after winning an election in October, is inheriting a decades-old problem that stumped her predecessors – and hoping to be the one to solve it.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/uk/uk-train-attack-wwk-intl-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:12:00.000Z","title":"British man arrested over mass stabbing attack on a train in England","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A mass stabbing attack occurred on a London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train traveling from Doncaster to London, with the incident taking place near Peterborough in Cambridgeshire.

Within eight minutes of the first call, the two initial   suspects were arrested after the train made an unplanned stop at Huntingdon station.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, British news agency PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  One eyewitness, who gave his name as Gavin, described   seeing one of the men who was initially suspected of being an attacker getting struck down by a police Taser. “Essentially, as they got closer to him, started shouting, like, ‘get down get down’… I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he told Sky News.\n \n\n   \n  The train remained at Huntingdon station Sunday morning, with medical equipment and other debris seen strewn on the platform.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the victims?\n \n\n   \n  A total of 11 victims received treatment in hospital. Ten people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, nine of whom were in life-threatening condition, while another person later self-presented that evening.\n \n\n   \n  As of Sunday evening, one person remains in hospital in life-threatening condition, BTP said. The man, an LNER staff member who was on the train, had “tried to stop the attacker,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  “Detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about the victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n  Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding.\n \n\n   \n    Who is behind the attack?\n \n\n   \n  Though two people were arrested on Saturday evening on suspicion of attempted murder, police said Sunday evening that one of the men was released from custody after they confirmed that he was not involved.\n \n\n   \n  The man still held by authorities is a 32-year-old, Black British national from Peterborough, where he boarded the train shortly before the attack. He is now being treated as the only suspect in the stabbing.\n \n\n   \n  “Our investigation is moving at pace and we are confident we are not looking for anyone else in connection to the incident,” BTP’s Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Cundy said in Sunday evening’s statement.\n \n\n   \n  “As would be expected, specialist detectives are looking into the background of the suspect we have in custody and the events that led up to the attack,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Sunday, police said that there is no indication the attack was terror-related.\n \n\n   \n  “At this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,” British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless told reporters. “At this stage, it would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause of this incident.”\n \n\n   \n  British defense secretary John Healey described the incident as an “isolated attack” in a Sky News interview.\n \n\n   \n  BTP had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before rescinding it later.\n \n\n   \n    How common are such attacks in the UK?\n \n\n   \n  The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, knife crime has risen overall since 2011. Some 51,527 knife crime offenses were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Of those, 15,689 were recorded in London.\n \n\n   \n  British politicians and other key figures expressed their shock at Saturday’s attack and offered their condolences to victims.\n \n\n   \n  “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” Starmer wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line – on which the train was traveling – is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes.

to break record \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A defining week has dawned in American politics with huge implications for Donald Trump’s second presidency, for his fellow Republicans and for a Democratic Party seeking to build a new future from the ashes of its 2024 election humiliation.\n \n\n   \n  The government shutdown is now in its 34th day and less than 48 hours from becoming the longest ever. But none of the political stakes compare to the misery of millions of Americans now struggling to get by on $0 paychecks, or who risk losing health care or vital food assistance.\n \n\n   \n  “It feels as if the government doesn’t care. The holidays are coming — people are going to be hungry. We are the land of opportunity, and it doesn’t look like it,” Janis, a federal worker, who is the daughter and granddaughter of military veterans, told CNN’s Camila DeChalus at  a food bank in suburban Maryland .\n \n\n   \n  Trump seems oblivious to political appearances or the risk that the shutdown could further damage him among most Americans who have soured on his second term. Creating an impression of gilded indifference, he hosted a “Great Gatsby”-themed  Halloween party  at his luxury Florida club and  boasted about  the swish renovation of a bathroom at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  In a combative interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Trump showed no sign of looking for a way out that did not involve a total defeat for Democrats, whom he described as “crazed lunatics.” He said the opposition party would eventually “have to” capitulate and vote to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  The president has complicated GOP calculations by  renewing demands  for reluctant Senate Republicans to shatter  the chamber’s filibuster rule  to reopen the government with a simple majority vote. GOP leaders fear this would embolden a future Democratic majority.\n \n\n   \n  “The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We’re not going to lose power,” Trump said on “60 Minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s embittered politics, which set the stage for the Washington shutdown disaster, will take a fresh twist with a handful of  key elections Tuesday , which could help resolve the impasse. Or perhaps they’ll just deepen the morass.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will deliver the first major verdict on Trump’s second term in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats lead in the polls. The New York mayor’s race could enshrine democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as an electric new talent in a party split between wariness of his politics and enthusiasm over his youth. A victory for Mamdani over the old guard of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo would also hand a new foil to Trump, who paints the 34-year-old as the far-left face of his rival party.\n \n\n   \n  In California, meanwhile, voters will decide whether to redraw the congressional map to  favor Democrats in a clutch of seats , in response to Trump’s similar moves  in Texas and elsewhere  ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Their endorsement would be a huge boost for  California Gov. Gavin Newsom , who is claiming a national leadership role ahead of a likely run for president in 2028.\n \n\n   \n  The elections and the deepening pain over the shutdown, set off on October 1 by Senate Democrats in a bid to force Republicans to  extend Obamacare subsidies , will play out against the daily backdrop of chaos and extremes of the second Trump era. The Supreme Court on Wednesday will  hear arguments  over Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs that started a global trade war. The justices’ eventual decision could set up a showdown with the executive branch or confirm Trump’s claim of emergency powers in yet another vast expansion of presidential authority.\n \n\n   \n  The same underlying question — of whether Trump is illegally acting on powers he’s not granted by the Constitution — underpins an escalating crisis over the administration’s strikes against what it claims are drug traffickers’ boats in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Critics accuse the administration of carrying out extrajudicial killings and breaking the law by acting without congressional consent. The White House has offered no proof or justification to the American people for its actions, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has banned subordinates from  discussing the strikes with Congress  without prior approval.\n \n\n   \n    Shutdown misery deepens as record approaches\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, pressure on both parties to end the shutdown is becoming visceral.\n \n\n   \n  The reality of rising health care premiums for those with Affordable Care Act policies struck home with  the start of open enrollment Saturday . Premiums were already set to rise significantly because of the costs of care and drugs. But the expiration of subsidies means prices are shooting out of the reach of many policyholders. This is why Democrats sought to use the only leverage they had in Washington — the ability to block most legislation in the Senate — to force a showdown to coerce Republicans into action.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to make sure that we can decisively address the Republican health care crisis, which is crushing people all across the country,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  If the dispute was only about health care, Democrats might have  claimed victory  by now.\n \n\n   \n  But by closing the government, they precipitated the furloughing of millions of federal employees as others were forced to work without pay. This has led to  the potential cutoff of food stamps  to more than 40 million people and is disrupting air travel  as Thanksgiving looms .\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accuse Trump of withholding emergency funding they say could partially finance food stamps for this month, claims that have been validated by several federal judges.\n \n\n   \n  But the extreme disruption and costs of the shutdown are scrambling normal political calculations and may mean no party earns a clear-cut win. “It’s very unfortunate that Donald Trump and Republicans have decided to weaponize hunger and withhold SNAP benefits,” Jeffries told Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Yet House Speaker Mike Johnson pointed out that the broader deprivation caused by the shutdown would not have occurred had Democrats agreed to GOP demands to reopen the government ahead of talks on Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how they can believe they’re winning, if it were indeed a game to them,” Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday.” The Louisiana Republican said Trump was “desperate” to reopen the government and had offered negotiations. The sticking point, however, is the Republican demand for the government to reopen so talks can happen — and the Democrat belief that such offers cannot be trusted.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said on “60 Minutes” that he was ready to fix the Obamacare subsidies problem. “We should fix that. Fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats,” he said. “All they have to do is let the country open and we’ll fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  But the president, as has been the case across his two terms, did not lay out any detailed plan for making health care more affordable.\n \n\n   \n    Senators still seeking off-ramp\n \n\n   \n  Some Democratic and Republican senators have been speaking informally about a device to fund the government in the short term. But Trump’s demands to eradicate the filibuster suggest he’s got no plans to back down. This hints at what is different in this shutdown. The president has proved that he’s ready to impose pain on anyone to fulfill his political goals and that the normal logic of shutdown politics may not apply. While Democratic voters are demanding their party shows backbone against Trump, their leaders must work out a way to create an off-ramp that would allow them to claim victory.\n \n\n   \n  Warning signs are also mounting for Trump and Republicans. New polls show that the Democrats’ top demand — extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies — is popular. And in a Washington Post-ABC News poll Thursday, voters blamed Trump and the GOP more than Democrats for the shutdown by 45%-33%. The president’s approval rating is only 41% in the  CNN Poll of Polls  average.\n \n\n   \n  But public disdain for Democrats is complicating the party’s effort to exploit Trump’s troubles. Some 68% of people in the Post poll thought the party was out of touch with most Americans. And a CBS News poll found 56% disapproved of Trump’s handling of the shutdown, while 55% said the same of how congressional Democrats and Republicans are responding to the situation.\n \n\n   \n  One warning sign for Democrats is that they are being effectively forced by Trump’s hardline tactics to balance the pain of citizens who risk losing health care against the suffering of those who could lose nutrition benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman wants to reopen the government so health care and food assistance crises can be addressed. “I fully, fully support these things, but this is the wrong tactic,” Fetterman said on “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  “And right now, by doing this, our government shut down, we’re getting neither of those things, and they guarantee neither you’re going to get your SNAP benefits, and you’re not going to get those kind of tax credits that we all need,” Fetterman continued. “Reopen this thing, and we can find a way forward.”\n \n\n   \n    How will Tuesday’s election shift shutdown drama?\n \n\n   \n  One intriguing question this week would be whether a Democratic sweep in New Jersey, Virginia, New York and the California redistricting initiative would reshape Republican shutdown tactics. Republicans might panic only a year ahead of the midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson, who will lose his job as speaker if Democrats win back the House next year, insisted on Sunday that the impasse could end because the opposition party would no longer need to use it as an issue as voters make their decisions. “We do have a sense that something may change next week,” he told the Republican Jewish Coalition leadership summit during a virtual appearance Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  But a rank-and-file Republican warned Sunday his party must make health care more affordable once the government is reopened. “The midterms are going to be a whole lot harder if Republicans just sit there and say, ‘We’re just going to let it (the enhanced subsidies) lapse. We’re not going to do anything,’” Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey told CNN’s Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.”\n \n\n   \n  The cost of living has shaped campaigning ahead of Tuesday’s elections, along with Trump’s perceived excesses. “Virginia voters can and will send a message amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington,” Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in New Jersey branded GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli as a tool of Trump. But outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is also unpopular, and  Ciattarelli called for change  in a state that has sometimes chosen GOP governors.\n \n\n   \n   Former President Barack Obama  on Saturday campaigned in both states, confirming his status as one of the few A-list national Democrats — but also the party’s desperate need to find new voices.\n \n\n   \n  He told voters in Norfolk, Virginia, that the stakes were clear. “We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don’t need to wonder about whether vulnerable people are going to be hurt, or ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. We’ve witnessed it. Elections do matter,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/what-to-know-elections-virginia-new-jersey-new-york","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"13:44:00-05:00","title":"Tuesday’s Key Races: What to Know About the NYC Election and Other Contests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elections across multiple states on Tuesday reflect key political dynamics in the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Elections in multiple states on Tuesday are set to gauge how voters feel in the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency — and whether Democrats have improved their standing with the midterm elections just one year away.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will choose new governors in Virginia, where the ongoing shutdown and Trump’s efforts to remake the government have affected hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and New Jersey, where increasing taxes and utility costs have placed affordability at the center of a competitive race.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City, the Democratic primary winner,  Zohran Mamdani , faces former Gov.  Andrew Cuomo , who is attempting a political comeback as an independent, and Republican Curtis Silwa in a mayoral race with significant implications for the future of the city and the Democratic Party.\n \n\n   \n  And in California, the race to redraw  congressional district boundaries  ahead of next year’s battle for majority control of the US House of Representatives faces a critical moment.\n \n\n   \n  A special election in Texas caps an important set of odd-year elections. Here are the races and issues to watch Tuesday:\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Cuomo are facing off a second time in the New York City mayoral election, after Mamdani — a  democratic socialist  who has energized young voters and progressives with his go-anywhere, do-anything campaign tactics and a message centered on affordability — handily defeated the former governor in the Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor’s race is a signal moment for a Democratic Party looking for its way out of the political wilderness. Similar dynamics — progressives against moderates and insiders against outsiders — could play out in primary elections next spring. Democrats can also draw lessons from how questions of  support for Israel  have played in the race, and from Mamdani’s approach to social media and publicity, including appearing on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  Some national Democrats — most notably the party’s top two figures in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York — have been slow to embrace Mamdani. Jeffries  endorsed him  only in late October, and Schumer has not said who he is supporting in the mayor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  Before  heading out to rallies  in Virginia and New Jersey on Saturday, former President Barack Obama called Mamdani. He has not endorsed the nominee — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections — and that did not change in the call. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Across the Hudson River, voters in the traditionally blue state of New Jersey will choose their replacement for term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\n \n\n   \n  Amid tax hikes and soaring utility costs, affordability has taken center stage in the election. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican who is endorsed by Trump and has praised the president’s performance in his second term, has sought to localize the race —  pitching himself  as the consummate “Jersey guy” and casting Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who moved to the state after a Navy career, as an outsider.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill and Democrats, meanwhile, have emphasized Ciattarelli’s links to Trump — a potentially decisive factor in a state with 800,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. One point of emphasis: Trump’s cancellation of funding for the Gateway Tunnel, a rail project linking New Jersey and New York City.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey has typically leaned blue, but Ciattarelli came close to winning in 2021, and the state shifted hard in Trump’s direction in 2024: He lost by just 6 percentage points, after a 16-point drubbing there in 2020.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Four years after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won a major upset, tapping into parents’ anger over local school boards, his lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, is seeking to replace him with a campaign centered on transgender policies, particularly in schools.\n \n\n   \n  But polls suggest her Democratic opponent, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, has a clear advantage headed into Election Day in a state that three times voted against Trump. Democrats have relentlessly tied Earle-Sears to Trump, and she has not sought to distance herself from the president.\n \n\n   \n  At a rally with Obama in Norfolk on Saturday, Spanberger described the election as a chance for Democrats to send a signal to the nation. “Amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington, Virginia can and will flip statewide seats from red to blue,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  None of the states holding elections on Tuesday are typically considered swing states in presidential elections. But Republicans were able to sweep statewide races four years ago. And with the Virginia’s proximity to Washington, it is home to hundreds of thousands of federal government workers who are affected by the Trump administration’s downsizing of the federal workforce and the government shutdown. Its gubernatorial election might be the closest to a true test of Trump’s performance this year.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown closer races down ballot in Virginia, where Republican John Reid and Democrat Ghazala Hashmi are facing off for lieutenant governor. In the contest for attorney general, Republicans have what could be their best chance to win Tuesday as GOP incumbent Jason Miyares faces Democrat Jay Jones, who has been  dogged by controversy  surrounding violent text messages he sent in 2022.\n \n\n   \n    Issue to watch: Utility costs\n \n\n   \n  The economy is a perennial campaign issue, with voters often expressing concerns about prices at the grocery store or at gas pumps. This year’s pocketbook metric is one less often discussed:  utility costs .\n \n\n   \n  Electricity prices across the country, which have  sharply increased  since 2020, have jumped over the last year, introducing a new financial strain for voters in places like New Jersey and Virginia. Candidates in both states have featured energy costs in their television ads and campaign speeches.\n \n\n   \n  Utility costs have become a particularly salient issue in New Jersey, where residential electricity prices have jumped nearly 21% over the past year compared with a 6% increase nationwide, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Ciattarelli has said Democrats’ push for clean energy is to blame, while Sherrill has said she will fix the issue by freezing utility rates, a proposal that has drawn skepticism from Murphy, the outgoing Democratic governor.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump appears to be aware of the political potency of the issue. In a tele-rally for Ciattarelli last month, the president repeatedly turned to talking about energy costs — an indication the issue could be front and center in next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n    California’s redistricting battle\n \n\n   \n  California’s vote on  a measure known as Proposition 50  will set the stage for next year’s midterm battle for control of the US House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will decide whether to green-light the Democratic plan spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom to set aside the congressional districts drawn by the state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission in favor of a gerrymandered map aimed at improving Democrats’ chances of winning five GOP-held seats.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a response to Texas, where the legislature approved and Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law new maps intended to help Republicans win five more seats — improving the party’s odds of retaining its House majority.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, widely viewed as a 2028 presidential contender, sought an answer that would neutralize those Texas gains. But unlike in Texas, California voters have to sign off on the plan to replace the nonpartisan commission’s maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections — before switching back to new, commission-drawn maps in the next decade, after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  A “yes” vote would be a big win for Democrats, who have fewer avenues to respond after Republicans also redrew Missouri’s maps to add one more seat, with Indiana convening a special legislative session on Monday to potentially add one or two more GOP seats and North Carolina moving to add one more Republican-leaning district. It would also be a milestone for Newsom, as he and a slew of other Democratic governors seek to position themselves as Trump’s strongest opponents ahead of potential presidential runs.\n \n\n   \n    Pennsylvania Supreme Court retention\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, voters must determine whether to keep three Democratic members of the state Supreme Court — a decision with potentially  significant ramifications  in the coming months and years in the crucial presidential battleground.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have a 5-2 majority on the state’s high court. The three incumbents on Tuesday’s ballot face yes-or-no questions of whether they’ll be retained for new 10-year terms. If they aren’t, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro would appoint interim replacements until elections for new justices were held in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  A change in party control of the state Supreme Court could have far-reaching implications for the 2028 presidential race, upcoming midterms and future redistricting. Ahead of the 2020 and 2024 elections, the Democratic majority sided with Democrats on key cases related to mail-in deadlines, provisional ballots and signature matching.\n \n\n   \n    Texas House special election\n \n\n   \n  The largely Democratic, Houston-area 18th Congressional District in Texas has been without representation in Washington for most of the last 16 months.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024,  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee  died. Her daughter, Erica Lee Carter, won the special election to fill the vacancy. But that special election was held the same day as the 2024 general election, which was won by former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner — who hadn’t been on the ballot in the special election.\n \n\n   \n  Turner  died in early March . Abbott, a Republican, scheduled the special election for eight months later — a move that gave the House GOP more breathing room as it moved toward passage of Trump’s landmark tax and domestic policy bill.\n \n\n   \n  This special election, a jungle primary that will go to a runoff featuring the top two finishers unless one tops 50% of the vote on Tuesday, has drawn several high-profile candidates. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, who has technically resigned to run for Congress but continues to serve, is among the Democrats, as are state Rep. Jolanda Jones and Amanda Edwards, a former Houston City Council member who lost in the 2024 primary to Jackson Lee. Republican Carmen Montiel, a Venezuelan American real estate agent and former TV journalist, is the highest-profile member of her party in the race.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/trump-dilbert-scott-adams-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:48:00-05:00","title":"Trump says he is ‘on it’ after ‘Dilbert’ creator Scott Adams pleads for lifesaving help","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scott Adams, the creator of the 'Dilbert' comic strip, publicly pleaded for help after being diagnosed with metastasized prostate cancer and unable to secure a scheduled IV treatment for the FDA-approved drug Pluvicto.

Cricket World Cup for first time \n       \n  Story by the Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:51 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  India won the Women’s Cricket World Cup for the first time with a 52-run victory over South Africa on Sunday, led by brilliant all-round performances from Deepti Sharma and Shafali Verma.\n \n\n   \n  Opening batter Verma, who was only called back into the squad as injury cover for the finals, scored a career-best 87 off 78 balls as the tournament co-host reached 298-7 in 50 overs after losing the toss and being sent in to bat.\n \n\n   \n  South Africa was out for 246 in 45.3 overs in reply with its chase effectively over after skipper Laura Wolvaardt was out for 101. Spinner Sharma took the final wicket of the match and returned bowling figures of 5-39 from 9.3 overs.\n \n\n   \n  “We were waiting for this moment, and now this moment has come,” India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said, reflecting on a triumph after two previous finals defeats. “Now we want to make this a habit.”\n \n\n   \n  India was the last of the four teams to qualify for the semifinals, but then beat defending champion and seven-time winner Australia by five wickets to reach the final. South Africa beat four-time champion England by 125 runs to reach the final for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  Winning at home gave India its first major women’s cricket title. Harmanpreet Kaur’s squad was the first, first-time champion since 2000, when New Zealand ended the long dominance of Australia and England.\n \n\n   \n    Player of the match\n \n\n   \n  Verma - who was drafted in last week for the injured Pratika Rawal - took 2-36 with the ball and was voted player of the match.\n \n\n   \n  “God sent me to do something good, and that was reflected today,” the 21-year-old Verma said. “I only focused on making runs today. My mind was clear.”\n \n\n   \n  Before her five-wicket haul, Sharma (58) posted her third half-century of the tournament to help India reached the second highest total in a World Cup final after Australia’s 356-5 against England in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  She finished the tournament with 22 wickets and 215 runs in nine matches to capture the player of the tournament honors.\n \n\n   \n  “I enjoyed myself with both bat and ball,” Sharma said of the final. “We were not relaxed at any time, but we were calm. I dedicate this trophy to my parents.”\n \n\n   \n  Wolvaardt a fine century on the back of her impressive semifinal performance. She was easily the tournament’s highest scorer with 571 runs at an average 71.37.\n \n\n   \n  Chasing a record 299, South Africa made a sedate start under immense pressure from medium pacer Renuka Singh.\n \n\n   \n    C.H.A.M.P.I.O.N.S.\n \n\n   \n  Wolvaardt shared a 51-run first-wicket stand before a direct throw from Amanjot Kaur ran out and Tazmin Brits for 23 in the 10th over.\n \n\n   \n  Anneke Bosche was bowled for a duck before Wolvaardt reached her half-century off 45 balls. She added 52 off 51 balls with Sune Luus, who scored 25.\n \n\n   \n  India lost its review in desperation to get Wolvaardt dismissed, and then gambled with Verma’s gentle off-breakers.\n \n\n   \n  The ploy worked with another double blow - Verma picked up two wickets in six deliveries to have South Africa in trouble at 123-4 in 22.1 overs. She sent back Luus with an easy return catch, and then had Marizanne Kapp (4) caught behind.\n \n\n   \n  Wolvaardt tried to keep the chase alive through partnerships with Sinalo Jafta (16) and Annerie Dercksen, who scored 35. In doing so, she reached a century off 96 balls.\n \n\n   \n  Sharma bowled Dercksen and then blunted South Africa’s chances when she Wolvaardt caught by Kaur in the 42nd over with the total at 220-7.\n \n\n   \n  Verma played a key role in setting the Proteas a challenging target after the final was delayed by two hours because of rain.\n \n\n   \n  She hit seven fours and two sixes and shared a 104-run opening stand with Smriti Mandhana (45).\n \n\n   \n  After Chloe Tryon dismissed Mandhana in the 18th over, Verma combined with Jemimah Rodrigues (24) to add a further 62 before both were out.\n \n\n   \n  From 171-3 in 29.4 overs, skipper Harmanpreet tried to restore the momentum but was bowled by Nonkululeko Mlaba in the 39th over. She scored only 20 runs, but combined with Sharma for 52 runs off 56 balls.\n \n\n   \n  Sharma steadied the innings with a run-a-ball 58, including three fours and a six and shared a pivotal 47-run, sixth-wicket partnership with Richa Ghosh that helped set up the winning total.\n \n\n   \n  The Board of Control for Cricket in India punctuated the tournament with a social media post to reflect the historic victory, topping the congratulatory message with the letters: C.H.A.M.P.I.O.N.S.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/harvard-university-goldenson-explosion","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:44:00-04:00","title":"Officials investigate ‘intentional’ explosion at Harvard University medical building that left no injuries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An apparently intentional explosion occurred at the Goldenson medical building of Harvard University on November 2, 2025, just before 3 a.m. ET.

Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:20 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Trump appeared on “60 Minutes” Sunday night, one year after suing the CBS show over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview — and he was well aware that his answers would similarly be trimmed for time.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to use that one,” Trump remarked after an awkward exchange with interviewer Norah O’Donnell about crime in Washington, D.C.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you,” Trump said at another point while praising the new owners of CBS.\n \n\n   \n  The newsmagazine’s producers evidently agreed that those moments weren’t the most newsworthy. CBS News aired about a third of O’Donnell’s sit-down with Trump on TV, and posted  most of the rest  on YouTube. The network also published the complete transcript of the 90-minute interview online.\n \n\n   \n  Both the TV broadcast and the transcript showed that O’Donnell sought to make the most of her time with Trump, pressing him on cost-of-living increases, foreign policy challenges, the government shutdown and other topics.\n \n\n   \n  O’Donnell asked pointed questions: “Are we going to war against Venezuela?” “When will you declare ‘mission accomplished’ on immigration?” “So you’re gonna send the military into American cities?”\n \n\n   \n  During a couple of key moments, O’Donnell pushed back on Trump’s talking points, for example, noting how “when the stock market is doing well, that doesn’t affect everybody.”\n \n\n   \n  Liberal commentators criticized O’Donnell for not interjecting and correcting Trump more often — reprising a decade-old debate within media industry circles about how to interview Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Norah let Trump lie and lie with barely any pushback or provision of corrective facts,” former MSNBC host Joy Reid commented on Bluesky.\n \n\n   \n  But it was not exactly a cushy interview. And O’Donnell’s questions generated lots of news. In one clip that ricocheted around social media, Trump said immigration raids in the US “haven’t gone far enough.” In another viral clip, Trump said, “I don’t know who he is” when asked about Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, whom  he pardoned last month .\n \n\n   \n  Trump seemingly had little to say when O’Donnell brought up “those that are suffering with cost-of-living increases and saying they’re living paycheck to paycheck.” He suggested people should blame his predecessor, Joe Biden, and made generic pledges about lowering the price of gas and fixing healthcare.\n \n\n   \n  “But Mr. President, with all due respect, you’ve been talking about fixing the healthcare insurance plan since 2015,” O’Donnell said at one point.\n \n\n   \n  “Sure. And you can’t do it because of the Democrats,” Trump responded.\n \n\n   \n    Praising David Ellison and Bari Weiss\n \n\n   \n  Sit-down interviews with Trump have been few and far between during his second term, so every question and every answer gets attention.\n \n\n   \n  And Sunday’s “60 Minutes” interview was even more noteworthy since Trump cares deeply about the newsmagazine but hadn’t said yes to an interview since 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Trump fielded O’Donnell’s questions on Friday, one year to the day after he filed a frivolous lawsuit against “60 Minutes” over its pre-election interview with Harris.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit — along with Trump’s public attacks and threats against CBS station licenses — shook the network and created a conundrum for parent company Paramount, which needed the Trump administration’s approval for its then-pending merger with Skydance Media.\n \n\n   \n  The Paramount board decided to strike a settlement deal, paying $16 million to Trump’s future presidential library to end the litigation.\n \n\n   \n  The settlement was widely criticized, including by journalists and entertainers at CBS. “The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert likened it to a “big fat bribe.” (Colbert’s show was cancelled soon thereafter, in  what the network cast  as a financial, not political, decision.)\n \n\n   \n  Within days of the settlement being finalized last July, the Trump administration approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance Media, clearing the way for Skydance boss David Ellison, son of the Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, to take control of CBS.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has kept tabs on the Paramount ownership change and has expressed hope that CBS will be “fairer” as a result.\n \n\n   \n  “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They’re friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine,” Trump said last month. “They will make the right decisions,” he added. “They’re going to revitalize CBS — hopefully, they’ll bring it back to its former glory.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also flattered the Ellisons during the “60 Minutes” taping, saying, “I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump specifically brought up David Ellison’s recent hiring of Bari Weiss as CBS News editor-in-chief, albeit not by name.\n \n\n   \n  “The young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great — from what I know. I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person,” Trump said after bringing up the Paramount settlement. (This is one of the parts of the interview that Trump suggested could be trimmed.)\n \n\n   \n  Trump falsely said “60 Minutes” was “forced to pay me a lot of money,” when in fact the settlement was a corporate calculation; CBS could have decided to fight the lawsuit in court, and many legal experts believed the network would have won.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also misstated the timeline, claiming the Harris interview “was election-changing, two nights before the election,” when in fact it aired one month before election day.\n \n\n   \n  CBS disclosed the settlement controversy in O’Donnell’s introduction to the interview broadcast on Sunday night. She noted that “the settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/europe/drones-spotted-belgian-airbase-spying-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"16:29:00Z","title":"Drones Spotted Above Belgian Airbase Were 'Spying' on Military Planes, Defense Minister Says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Several drones were spotted flying over Belgium’s Kleine-Brogel Air Base, where F-16 fighter jets and strategic military assets are stored.

spotted above a Belgian airbase over the weekend were there “to spy” on military fighter jets, the country’s defense minister said Sunday, at a time when European nations are on high alert for airspace intrusions.\n \n\n   \n  “They come to spy, to see where the F-16s are, where the munitions are, and other highly strategic things,” Theo Francken told CNN affiliate RTBF.\n \n\n   \n  The drones were clearly “spying,” the minister said, noting the “long time” one of them had spent over the airbase.\n \n\n   \n  Kleine-Brogel Air Base, in the municipality of Peer, hosts the largest unit of Belgian defense forces in the country and aims to “fundamentally contribute to NATO’s nuclear deterrence strategy,” according to its website. Local media reports have long rumoured the presence of US nuclear weapons at the site.\n \n\n   \n  When asked for comment, NATO referred CNN to the Belgian authorities. CNN has approached Belgium’s Ministry of Defense for further comment.\n \n\n   \n  The latest sightings come as Europe is on high alert after recent incursions by drones and aircraft into NATO airspace.\n \n\n   \n  The airbase is home to F-16 fighter jets, the airbase’s website said, adding that these are set to be replaced by “ultramodern” F-35s within “a few years.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking of the latest sightings, Francken said that Russia is “trying to do this in all European countries” but stopped short of directly pinning the blame on Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “Is it the Russians now?

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the agents were conducting an immigration enforcement operation at the time. It said agents had observed a “red vehicle” that was “aggressively” tailing their vehicle, and when the agents turned, the car crashed into Border Patrol. DHS said a “hostile crowd” gathered around their vehicle and began “verbally abusing them and spitting on them.”\n \n\n   \n  But Mayor Daniel Biss disputed the agency’s account of the incident in an interview with CNN, calling DHS “a bunch of liars.”\n \n\n   \n  He told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday he is opening two investigations into the incident: one into the “violence” federal agents used against people he described as “innocent bystanders,” and one into the vehicle collision. The Border Patrol agents “deliberately caused a car accident” by intentionally braking while being followed by the red vehicle, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t like being followed, because they don’t like being watched, because they don’t want the world to know what they’re doing,” said the mayor of the Chicago suburb. “They forced this car accident, and then they started literally beating up innocent bystanders.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has asked DHS about the mayor’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  The incident comes amid growing scrutiny of  the aggressive tactics  used by Border Patrol and ICE, including against US citizens. Multiple people have been  shot by federal agents  during immigration enforcement operations, and  multiple car crashes  and alleged “rammings” involving federal agents have occurred as DHS sets out to meet  high arrest targets  set by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said three US citizens were arrested “as a result of their violence against law enforcement” in Evanston on Friday, but the agency did not specify what the three had allegedly done, and did not identify them or list any charges against them.\n \n\n   \n  In response to CNN’s questions about the videos showing the man being punched in the head, a DHS spokesperson sent a statement saying a Border Patrol agent had “delivered several defensive strikes” to a person he was arresting. The statement said the man had kicked the agent and “grabbed the (agent’s) genitals and squeezed them” during the arrest, but that account was not readily supported by the video.\n \n\n   \n  Video shows one agent restraining the man, then dragging him around as another agent helps pin him to the ground. As one agent punches the man several times, the man screams, “Help me, help me.” Agents appear to fight off a screaming crowd trying to help the man by pushing them away and threatening them with pepper spray.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t breathe,” the man says as the agent continues to kneel on him. The agents then drag him into a vehicle, his left shoe lying on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  Biss said that after the man was arrested, federal agents “took him away and booked him and drove him around” but did not take him to receive medical care. The man was “not in good shape” after the arrest, he said. CNN has asked DHS whether it took the man to receive medical care.\n \n\n   \n  “This is lawlessness,” the mayor said. “This is an outrage, and everyone’s got to stand up against it.”\n \n\n   \n  By arresting three US citizens, he said, federal agents “weren’t even trying to enforce immigration. They were just trying to go after dissent.”\n \n\n   \n  Following a new Evanston policy, local police obtained the badge numbers of the federal agents involved in Friday’s arrests, Biss said. “Now we have the first step toward accountability, by being able to identify them,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  City officials are “thinking through options, including going to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, or potentially communicating with our state’s attorney to figure out the right way to demand justice for our residents who were assaulted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker  had asked  federal officials to pause immigration enforcement operation in and near homes, schools, parks and other areas where families would be celebrating Halloween over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Wymer, who took videos of the incident, described the agents’ actions as “absolutely deplorable.”\n \n\n   \n  “These agents chose to terrorize our neighborhood on Halloween, a day that is supposed to be special and fun for families,” Wymer said. “This is not normal. This is not OK, and our town will stand with our immigrant neighbors no matter what.”\n \n\n   \n  Five people from Mexico were arrested Friday in Evanston and the neighboring city of Skokie, DHS told CNN. The agency did not specify the reason for each arrest but listed trespassing and entering the United States without authorization, a civil immigration offense.\n \n\n   \n  Local and state officials criticized the immigration operation in the area Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m disgusted and outraged by reports of ICE terrorizing students, families, and community members today in Evanston, Skokie, and across the 9th District,” US Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat,  said on X.  “My team and I are monitoring the situation and coordinating with local partners to protect our neighbors. We won’t tolerate this inhumanity and will defend the dignity of every person in our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN on Friday, Biss had a clear message for federal officials: “To Gregory Bovino, Kristi Noem, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection: Get the hell out of our city.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/terror-attack-plot-michigan-arrests","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00Z","title":"Alleged Terror Plot Thwarted by FBI in Michigan Over Halloween Weekend","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI in Michigan thwarted a potential terrorist attack over Halloween weekend, according to a public statement by Director Kash Patel.

A shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s.\n \n\n   \n  A  potential terrorist attack over Halloween weekend  was thwarted by the FBI, according to a social media post by agency Director Kash Patel.\n \n\n   \n  Details of the alleged plot are scarce but two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case told CNN about the “pumpkin day” reference, the online chat and the shooting range activity.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know and don’t know about the potential terror attack:\n \n\n   \n    Two arrests, and others being questioned\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others were being questioned, according to two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case. Their ages range from 16 to 20s.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Amir Makled, who represents one of the adults in custody, told CNN Sunday that three people have been arrested, two were questioned and an additional two people were questioned and released. CNN has reached out to the FBI for clarification.\n \n\n   \n  Patel  wrote on X  the FBI “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  “The FBI swept out from the Detroit field office last night and through this morning, taking people into custody, executing search warrants and doing subpoenas for phones, computers and other material,” John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Makled urged people to wait for “verifiable facts” before jumping to conclusions. His client, a 20-year-old US citizen who has not been publicly identified, is cooperating with authorities and has not been formally charged, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney said he is concerned about “rhetoric that’s harmful to the large Arab and Muslim population in the state of Michigan, specifically in Dearborn” since reports of the alleged plot emerged.\n \n\n   \n  Laraib Irfan said he woke up to what he described as loud bangs from “smoke bombs” in the predawn and saw FBI agents outside his neighbor’s house two doors down on their quiet Dearborn street. He said he is “close” to the family that lives in the home and is “just trying to find answers” about what happened. Some occupants of the home were handcuffed outside.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re like family. They’re like friends. We’re always talking with each other,” he said of the neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t believe that something like that would even go down on my block,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    How the alleged plot was uncovered\n \n\n   \n  The ISIS-inspired plot unfolded in online chatrooms, according to the two law enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  An FBI undercover person was introduced into the chatroom in the early stages of discussion, the officials added.\n \n\n   \n  “This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” said Miller, citing conversations with law enforcement officials who had been briefed.\n \n\n   \n  The participants discussed whether to carry out an ISIS-inspired plot in the US – “though what that plot was, when that plot would be, what the target would be, was unclear as they discussed various options in terms of timing,” Miller said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what the two people arrested were charged with and whether charges have been filed.\n \n\n   \n  Miller said the FBI moved in this week when a group of people who were being monitored “went to a shooting range with AK-47s and other weapons, fired a large number of rounds of ammunition, practiced tactical high-speed reloads, and in the discussions it was picked up a reference to what we’re told is ‘pumpkin day’ – a possible reference to Halloween.”\n \n\n   \n  The individuals taken into custody had discussed in their communications whether they were ready to carry out an attack, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said. Some said they needed more time and training, but a younger member of the group had said that it was time to act, two officials added.\n \n\n   \n  There was also a discussion at one point about taking a one-day trip to New York City to see the sights, including visiting Rockefeller Center and looking at the Statue of Liberty, the officials said. There was no talk about the trip being a reconnaissance for an attack, but the conversation caught the attention of both the FBI and the NYPD as the investigation continued.\n \n\n   \n    ‘No current threat to public safety’\n \n\n   \n  The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed “the FBI in Michigan were present in the cities of Dearborn and Inkster … conducting law enforcement activities,” spokesperson Jordan Hall told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no current threat to public safety.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dearborn Police Department said it “has been made aware that the FBI conducted operations in the City of Dearborn.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to assure our residents that there is no threat to the community at this time,” the police department said.\n \n\n   \n  In the city of Inkster, the FBI carried out “law enforcement activities at a storage facility located on Michigan Avenue,” Police Chief Tamika L. Jenkins said.\n \n\n   \n  She said local FBI agents confirmed there is no threat to residents. But to assuage any concerns, Inkster police “will have additional personnel deployed throughout the evening to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, particularly those participating in Halloween festivities,” the police chief said.\n \n\n   \n  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the FBI and Michigan State Police.\n \n\n   \n  “I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” she posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/hegseth-bars-military-officials-from-discussing-drug-boat-strikes-with-congress-without-prior-approval","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"16:51:00Z","title":"Hegseth Bars Military Officials from Discussing Drug Boat Strikes with Congress Without Prior Approval","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has issued a directive requiring Defense Department personnel to obtain prior approval from his office before discussing sensitive military operations—including U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats in Latin America—with Congress.

critical minerals; Foreign Military Sales reform; AUKUS, a trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States; anomalous health incidents also known as “Havana Syndrome”; and Spectrum, which refers to the electromagnetic spectrum that underpins military operations and other key US government functions.\n \n\n   \n  A Pentagon spokesman told CNN in a statement that the memo is a “pragmatic step to internally review the Department’s processes for communicating with Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Department intends to improve accuracy and responsiveness in communicating with the Congress to facilitate increased transparency. This review is for processes internal to the Department and does not change how or from whom Congress receives information,” said Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesman.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Rep.

Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said. Democrats left a briefing on Thursday furious that Defense Department lawyers  hadn’t been present  to answer basic questions about the legal justification for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth,  whose tenure  has been beleaguered by leaks, has taken a number of steps to more tighly control information since earlier this year, including barring most engagements between DoD personnel and think tanks, reporters, or other outside events and conferences.

Elliot Gaiser, told select Senate and House lawmakers on Thursday that the US strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean did not trigger the law’s requirements because they don’t meet the definition of hostilities and did not require a declaration of war from Congress, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Gaiser was drawing on a classified legal opinion produced by his office that justifies the strikes by equating drug cartels with terrorists and focuses on the death caused by the drugs brought to American shores, the sources said. Gaiser emphasized the fact that the US military wasn’t being attacked in response to the strikes as part his argument that America was not at war, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has carried out at least 15 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels since early September, killing a total of 64 people, according to a CNN tally. The latest known strike  occurred  on Saturday in the Caribbean, killing three people.\n \n\n   \n  Some legal experts have said the military strikes could violate US and international law.  Democratic lawmakers , and at least  one Republican , have criticized the administration for not being more forthcoming with details on the legal justification for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration notified Congress in early September that it had struck an alleged drug vessel. Under the 1973 War Powers Resolution, that notification started a 60-day clock, after which the administration has to either cease the use of military force, get an extension on the clock or a war authorization from Congress,  according  to legal scholars.\n \n\n   \n  But Gaiser told lawmakers that the administration does not need to seek an extension of that 60-day clock, which expires on Monday, because the law doesn’t apply in this case, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN  first reported  on the existence of the OLC opinion, which legal experts said appears to justify an open-ended war against a secret list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers. The opinion appears designed to give the president power to designate drug traffickers as enemy combatants and have them summarily killed without legal review, those experts said. Historically, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has requested comment from the White House and the Justice Department on the congressional briefings and the administration’s legal rationale for striking the alleged drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Post first  reported  on Gaiser’s briefing of lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump issued an executive order on the first day of his second term designating certain drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, giving the US military greater leeway to attack them. The administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats have coincided with increased pressure on the regime of Venezuelan autocrat Nicolás Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is considering plans to target cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, though he has not yet made a decision on whether to move forward with them, CNN  reported  last month.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/europe/italian-alps-avalanche-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Five German climbers killed in Italian Alps avalanche","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five German climbers died in an avalanche on Cima Vertana, a mountain in the Ortler range of the Italian Alps, near the village of Solda.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A well-armed jihadist group affiliated with al Qaeda is closing in on Bamako, the capital of Mali. The country’s military junta and their Russian partners are struggling to counter the jihadis, who now hold sway in many parts of the huge Sahelian country.\n \n\n   \n    What’s happening now\n \n\n   \n  Fuel is running short in Bamako as militants belonging to a group called Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam al-Muslimin (JNIM) cut roads to the capital, attack military patrols and ambush tanker trucks.\n \n\n   \n  As the situation deteriorates, the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany among others have urged their nationals to leave Bamako. On Thursday, the UK warned its citizens to “leave immediately by commercial flight if you judge it safe to do so,” while the  US State Department  cited the “unpredictability of Bamako’s security situation” in encouraging Americans to leave.\n \n\n   \n  Video and images from the city in recent days show long lines of motorbikes and other vehicles queuing at gas stations. Some residents have accused the police of sequestering fuel supplies, according to local media. Schools and colleges closed because of the shortages.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two months, JNIM has stepped up attacks on fuel supplies, ambushing tankers on the roads from Ivory Coast and Senegal.\n \n\n   \n  In one attack in mid-September, the militants attacked a convoy of more than 100 fuel trucks, setting fire to half of them, according to Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which maps conflicts.\n \n\n   \n  The militants have seized large amounts of weaponry from government forces and demonstrated their ability to use drones, says the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), which analyzes terrorist groups.\n \n\n   \n  JNIM “has diversified its tactics” terrorism analyst Daniele Garofalo told CNN, stepping up its “economic warfare campaigns with roadblocks, extortion/taxation and fuel blockades.”\n \n\n   \n  In a video released last month, JNIM spokesman Abu Hudheifa al-Bambari demanded people cooperate in areas controlled by the group by stopping at its checkpoints and advised them to avoid traveling with military convoys.\n \n\n   \n  Government forces have increased patrols and carried out helicopter attacks, claiming to have killed dozens of militants. But the attacks continue, extending fuel shortages to large swathes of central and southern Mali and isolating garrisons of government forces.\n \n\n   \n    How did we get here?\n \n\n   \n  JNIM has long been active in Mali, a French colony until it gained independence in 1960, and other parts of the Sahel, especially in neighboring Burkina Faso. It was formed in 2017 as a coalition of jihadist factions and immediately declared its allegiance to al Qaeda. It has grown in strength in recent years, bringing instability to much of central and western Mali.\n \n\n   \n  This summer it embarked on a campaign of economic warfare in western Mali. It has “attacked factories, industrial facilities, infrastructure projects and artisanal gold mining sites,” according to Garofalo.\n \n\n   \n  “JNIM has demonstrated a new level of coordination, conducting operations hundreds of kilometers apart,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Russian mercenaries have deployed to Mali for counterterrorism missions since 2021, first as part of the Wagner Group and now as what Moscow calls the Africa Corps. But they have been unable to stem the militants’ advance and have suffered extensive casualties.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, JNIM claimed that a “complex ambush” had wiped out a convoy of Russian contractors and Malian soldiers in the north of the country, killing 50 Russians.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian presence appears to have alienated large sections of Mali’s population. A recent Human Rights Watch  report  said the junta and its Russian backers “have committed dozens of summary executions and enforced disappearances of ethnic Fulani men … whom they accuse of collaborating with the JNIM.”\n \n\n   \n    What are the implications for the wider region?\n \n\n   \n  Mali and its neighbors – especially Burkina Faso and Niger – have all seen chronic volatility in recent years. JNIM and other militant groups are active in all three countries. In July alone, JNIM claimed 54 attacks in Burkina Faso, 36 in Mali and seven in Niger.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, JNIM claimed its first attack in northern Nigeria, which is also wracked by militant violence.\n \n\n   \n  Many analysts believe that another coup in Mali, or the collapse of the current regime led by Assimi Goïta, would further destabilize the Sahel, allowing militant groups to expand operations.\n \n\n   \n  JNIM has “increasingly integrated into the region’s illicit economies by exploiting fuel and arms smuggling routes in the tri-border area between Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Ghana,” according to the CEP.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a conflict amid the fluid borders between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso and there is also a risk of contagion to other states – northwest Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire for example,” said Edmund Fitton-Brown, a former coordinator of the UN Sanctions Monitoring Team and now a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, based in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  But Burkina Faso is most at risk, with a fragile military regime that has no writ beyond the capital. “The contagion spreading to Burkina Faso is all but a certainty,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    What might happen next?\n \n\n   \n  There is no sign of the militants preparing for a frontal attack on Bamako. Their strategy seems to be to strangle the capital and provoke unrest against the military junta.\n \n\n   \n  While the Malian army moves slowly and predictably, JNIM militants blend into local communities and get to know their surroundings.\n \n\n   \n  “JNIM has become very adept at conveying the discontent and demands of the poorer sections of the population and ethnic minorities,” said Garofalo, who believes its objective seems to be more about presenting itself as a better government.\n \n\n   \n  It now has the capacity “to create prolonged crises, disrupt supplies, target secondary centrers and influence public opinion, thereby putting serious pressure on an already politically fragile junta,” Garofalo added.\n \n\n   \n  “However, turning this pressure into the fall or replacement of the regime would require seriously escalating operations that have so far been sporadic. JNIM is focusing on systemic weakening and the junta’s loss of local control.”\n \n\n   \n  So far it has been succeeding. While JNIM’s ultimate intentions remain unclear, “Mali could become the first country ruled by (al Qaeda) in its four-decade history,” according to the CEP.\n \n\n   \n  Fitton-Brown said the junta in Bamako won’t get any support from outside. They “essentially evicted the French and fell out with both the UN and the regional force ECOWAS. The Russians were never going to be an alternative.”\n \n\n   \n  “JNIM will eventually insist on a government more to their liking in Bamako, even if they don’t take control themselves and accept something softer than an al Qaeda affiliated regime,” Fitton Brown added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"13:24:00Z","title":"A timeline of US strikes on boats that have killed 64","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States military launched a sustained campaign of 15 strikes between September 2025 and November 2025, killing 64 people and destroying 16 boats, claiming to target vessels operated by designated terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and Colombian narco-terrorist groups.

boats that have killed 64 \n       \n  By Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, Matt Stiles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:24 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has killed 64 people in 15 strikes that have destroyed 16 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There have been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, 27th.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor. The Mexican Navy said Friday that the search is in a “suspended active” status and the person is considered missing.\n \n\n   \n     October 29 \n \n\n   \n  The United States Armed Forces carried out an attack on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean that left four dead, Hegseth reported.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary said in a  post on X . He added that US forces suffered no casualties.\n \n\n   \n    November 1\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out  a strike on a nother vessel in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/economy/scotus-trump-tariffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-05:00","title":"Trade deals and $90 billion in tariff revenue: What’s riding on the landmark Supreme Court case kicking off this week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is facing a pivotal Supreme Court case that challenges the legality of his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs on countries like India, Brazil, and China—some as high as 145% on China.

That’s more than half of the tariff revenue the country collected during the 2025 fiscal year, which ended on September 30.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Trump said in an interview with Fox Business that if the Supreme Court ruled against him, “we’d have to pay back money” and reimburse companies for the billions of dollars they have already paid.\n \n\n   \n  While the case plays out — and it could go on for several months — businesses will need to keep paying IEEPA tariffs, so the sum of potential refunds will keep growing.\n \n\n   \n  However, it would not be an easy or quick process for businesses to get refunds. It’s also unclear if all businesses that have paid these tariffs would qualify for a refund. The justices would likely make such determinations if they ultimately render Trump’s IEEPA tariffs illegal, trade attorneys  told CNN .\n \n\n   \n    Trade agreements\n \n\n   \n  The threat of instantly imposing higher tariffs is a  key tool  Trump has used to pressure countries into entering trade agreements and, in some cases, signing deals with the United States. In exchange, trading partners have committed to increasing purchases of American goods and increasing their investments in American businesses on top of lowering tariffs on American exports.\n \n\n   \n  But all that could be jeopardized if the Supreme Court sides against Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “The IEEPA tariffs have been the basis for countries to reach agreements with the United States, and it is unknown what happens if the IEEPA tariffs no longer can be imposed,” Dave Townsend, a partner in Dorsey & Whitney’s International Trade Group, said in a note last week.\n \n\n   \n  “Presumably, the Trump Administration will claim that nothing changes, and that the agreements remain valid,” he added. But it could certainly incentivize trading partners to try to go back to the drawing table with Trump, aiming to get better arrangements. It could even empower some countries to impose their own retaliatory tariffs on American exports until their own border taxes are lowered.\n \n\n   \n    What this means for Trump’s tariff agenda\n \n\n   \n  US presidents have always had an  extensive menu  of tariffs to impose. But Trump has mainly used two in his second term: the IEEPA tariffs and Section 232 tariffs, which give the president the authority to impose higher tariffs on national security grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Section 232 tariffs can only be used to target specific industry sectors, and require an investigation by the Commerce Department. Trump has used Section 232 this year to raise border taxes on autos, auto parts, steel, aluminum, copper and furniture, among others. He’s also initiated several ongoing investigations that could result in higher levies on a slew of other goods.\n \n\n   \n  Trump will retain the ability to impose those tariffs as well as several others no matter how the Supreme Court rules. But none of those will allow him to change import duties with the flick of a switch, as he has done with IEEPA.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/shutdown-native-communities","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"12:11:00-05:00","title":"Native American Leaders Warn of Increasing Pain from Government Shutdown and Layoffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Native American leaders are raising urgent concerns that the current government shutdown and mass federal layoffs—known as reductions in force (RIFs)—are severely undermining essential services like education, food security, and healthcare in Native communities.

\n  By Morgan Rimmer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:11 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Native American leaders warned senators last week that mass layoffs and potential benefit lapses are making this government shutdown more painful for their communities and insisted that the federal government fulfill its treaty obligations with tribal nations.\n \n\n   \n  “The shutdown reductions in force have crept into our classrooms, our early childhood programs and our homes. What began as a budget dispute in Washington has become a daily crisis in Indian country,” Kerry Bird, ﻿president of the board of directors of the National Indian Education Association, told senators during a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Bird and other witnesses were invited by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to testify about how layoffs, also called reductions in force or RIFs, and the shutdown have affected their communities. They emphasized that in reducing the number of the federal employees who interface often with tribes, especially on issues of education, economic development, health and food security, the administration has left Native communities isolated and unsupported at a time when many federal benefits like SNAP are delayed.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who has long been critical of the Trump administration’s mass layoffs, chaired the hearing, and was the only Republican in attendance.\n \n\n   \n  “The loss of employees with deep institutional knowledge and long standing relationships with Native communities, weakens the effectiveness of these crucial federal programs,” Murkowski said as the hearing opened.\n \n\n   \n  As the hearing began, Bird told senators that he had just been told that seven of nine employees at the Office of Indian Education under the Department of Education had been laid off.\n \n\n   \n  “That means no one to process grants, approved budgets or support in tribal education departments and Indian parent committees. If these terminations are allowed to go into full effect, Indian education programs as we know them would be functionally eliminated,” said Bird.\n \n\n   \n  “When our ancestors signed treaties with the United States, they did so in exchange for certain guarantees. One of these was that our children and our children’s children would be educated this obligation is not a discretionary choice, it is the payment on a debt owed,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, who has been one of the few Democrats to break with her party and vote for the GOP-backed stopgap funding resolution to reopen the government, told CNN last week that she believes this shutdown is potentially more harmful to Native communities than past shutdowns have been.\n \n\n   \n  “Yeah, I think, what I hear from the tribes are because of the RIFs, because of the lack of a federal workforce, they’re already getting hit, and now, if some of them are being impacted by the shutdown because they don’t have access to SNAP funding, like some of my tribes, yeah, it’s a double whammy,” said Cortez Masto. “There is a concern that we’ve got to live up to just our existing obligations to the tribes, that the federal government doesn’t and we’ve got to do more.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have a trust and treaty obligation to the tribes, whether there’s a government shutdown or not, and the federal government has a role to play, and we have to continue to support that obligation,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Sarah Harris, the vice chairwoman of the Mohegan Tribe and the secretary of the United South and Eastern Tribes, said that the uncertainty surrounding the shutdown has been particularly harmful.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that one of the things that has been incredibly challenging for tribes during shutdown and with the RIFs is just the complete lack of transparency,” said Harris.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no end in sight, and there’s no information. I mean, tribal governments are resilient and resourceful, and we are problem solvers, but it’s difficult to know what you’re even solving for – if its short term or if it’s long term – and so I think everyone right now is just, you know, dealing with what’s in front of them and trying to find stopgap measures to provide for our tribal citizens, until, you know, there’s more clarity,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Two federal judges ruled on Friday that the administration must use emergency funds to continue paying for some SNAP benefits, however that doesn’t cancel out the uncertainty for Native communities.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, the top Democrat on the panel, emphasized the government’s obligations to Native American communities in his opening remarks at the hearing, saying, “when the federal government shuts down, our trust and treaty and legal obligations do not vanish, but they are put at risk. Promises to provide health care, housing, education and public safety, among so many other critical services, are all on the chopping block.”\n \n\n   \n  Schatz added, “Native programs are not DEI spending, they are not charity, they are the law; attempting to cancel funds for Native programs, RIFing more than 4200 federal employees and eliminating tribal consultation policies, that’s not the United States government meeting its trust and legal obligations.”\n \n\n   \n  Murkowski, who represents a state with a large Native America population, emphasized that federal layoffs and potential benefit lapses are disproportionately affecting Native communities, even when they aren’t carried out in agencies specifically tasked with working with tribal nations.\n \n\n   \n  “I think they kind of like, block them off – It’s the Bureau of Indian Education, it’s the Bureau of Indian Affairs, it’s the Indian Health Service. And so, it’s like, okay, but what they’re failing to recognize, perhaps, is how many other programs are serving tribal citizens across this country. And so whether it’s SNAP or whether it’s LIHEAP or whether it’s Head Start, none of those programs have the word Indian in them, but the impact to American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians may be, may be disproportionate,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Murkowski also noted that her Native constituents are particularly concerned about having to choose between food and fuel as winter sets in. The damage from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, which hit Alaska around two weeks into the shutdown, has also complicated matters.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s something that for many, is really frightening,” she said, adding “There’s a lot of anxiety when it comes to food security right now. And again, in Alaska, this is the time of year where, okay, nothing is growing. You’ve either, you’ve either gotten your moose or your caribou or your fish, or you haven’t. And for those who were impacted by this, this devastating typhoon two weeks ago, almost all those in those villages have lost their food supply for the winter, the power out, and so food security is a is a big, big deal right now, as we enter wintertime.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/sport/new-york-city-marathon-obiri-kipruto","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00-05:00","title":"Obiri sets women’s NYC Marathon course record, Kipruto wins men’s race in photo finish","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hellen Obiri of Kenya set a new women’s course record at the 2025 New York City Marathon with a time of 2:19:51, breaking the previous record of 2:22:31 set by Margaret Okayo in 2003.

These agencies have made 68 arrests in connection with Broadview protests since October 3, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said on October 28.\n \n\n   \n  The arrests sometimes expose a tension between demonstrators’ desire to exercise their constitutional free speech rights and the intention of authorities – who say some protesters have resisted their attempts to keep paths to the building clear – to let ICE agents and others travel safely to and from the facility.\n \n\n   \n  CNN talked to some arrested demonstrators or, in one case, a protester’s representative, to ask about their experiences in getting arrested on accusations ranging from petty to felony offenses. Here are their stories.\n \n\n   \n    Chicago woman held for hours after a crowd scuffle with police\n \n\n   \n  A’Keisha Lee was standing and chanting with a crowd of protesters near the Broadview ICE facility on October 17 when she saw a swarm of police officers hop out of police vans wearing helmets and carrying batons, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I was sickened,” the 30-year-old Chicago resident recalled. “And I remember feeling really scared.”\n \n\n   \n  The officers walked toward her and the other demonstrators in a “militarized fashion” and began pushing them back, she said. Video of the encounter shows Lee at the front of the crowd when officers with Illinois State Police patches on their sleeves pushed in an apparent attempt to clear them from a paved area, and some demonstrators tried to hold their ground.\n \n\n   \n  Chaos ensued. There was yelling, people falling, and some who appeared to get hurt in the scuffle, Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  She was hit in the face with a baton, and wasn’t sure whether the strike was intentional, she recounted. She’d later discover a bruise on her face.\n \n\n   \n  Lee fell to the ground, and officers helped her up, according to Lee and the video, which was distributed by Reuters. An officer then detained her, putting zip ties around her wrists, she said; that moment is not shown in the Reuters video. Lee couldn’t understand why she was being arrested.\n \n\n   \n  “I was asking them to let me go,” Lee said, “and reinforcing that I hadn’t did anything I wasn’t allowed to do.”\n \n\n   \n  She was escorted to a curb to sit, and moments later placed in a police vehicle that took her to the Broadview Police Department. Lee’s mind raced as she rode in the police car. She worried about going to jail and whether the conditions would be clean and safe. She also worried about whether she’d be treated differently as a Black woman in the legal system.\n \n\n   \n  At the police station, she was booked, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a holding cell with other female protesters for about five hours before being released.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police had arrested her on two Class A misdemeanor counts of resisting a police officer – punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500 – Cook County court records show. She also was cited on suspicion of disobeying a police officer, a petty offense that carries a fine. Her court appearance is scheduled for November 25.\n \n\n   \n  The court documents do not offer details about what led to the arrest, but Lee denies resisting and says it was never made clear to her how she was disobeying police.\n \n\n   \n  “From my understanding, it was in my rights to be there,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police did not directly answer CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including Lee’s assertion that she did nothing wrong or why officers pushed back this crowd. However, they did issue a statement generally addressing the approach of the state, county and local officers who’ve been policing the protests since early October – a group they call the “Unified Command.”\n \n\n   \n  These officers in Broadview “give loud, clear, consistent, and repeated directions and commands to crowds and provide individuals numerous opportunities to comply with the law,” state police said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to note that since the establishment of the Unified Command, there have been no violent confrontations between ICE and protesters in Broadview involving the use of chemical agents, which is a significant departure from operations prior to their presence,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  Lee has protested at the Broadview ICE facility on several recent Fridays, taking issue with how ICE is picking up allegedly undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, and how federal agents are  deploying tear gas  during protests in neighborhoods.\n \n\n   \n  “I think how this country has treated immigrants is one of our original transgressions,” Lee said. “And this is the first tester for what we will allow as a people.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee, who works for a local nonprofit, worries about the fate of her court case; however, she stands by her decision to protest.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s always a fear of being treated like an example when these things happen,” Lee said. “But I do believe that I did not break the law.”\n \n\n   \n    He was arrested while trying to enter the ICE facility\n \n\n   \n  Sean Mills says he is not happy about how immigrants have been treated since the Trump administration started aggressively cracking down on illegal immigration earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  To voice his frustrations, Mills, 37, of Chicago, has become a weekly demonstrator at the Broadview ICE facility. He shows up every Friday and Saturday – sometimes wearing an American flag draped around his shoulders – and joins other protesters outside the facility.   \n \n\n   \n  But on October 17, Mills was arrested for the first time in his life, he said, after he tried to enter the building. Mills had become increasingly concerned with  claims by local activists  that the facility’s conditions were inhumane. So, Mills wanted to view the building’s interior himself.\n \n\n   \n  “I just had the urge to walk over and test my luck,” Mills said. “I walked over to see if I could investigate as a citizen and enter the facility to ask questions and document.”\n \n\n   \n  Officers surrounded Mills near the facility’s entrance, and one told him he was not allowed inside, Mills said. That same officer told Mills to “go back immediately” or be arrested, according to Mills.   \n \n\n   \n  “I tried to explain myself a little bit further,” Mills said, adding he told the officers he was a concerned citizen who wanted to go inside. “And I think about five or 10 seconds later, he (the officer) said ‘OK, you’re under arrest.’”\n \n\n   \n  Mills was shocked because he didn’t believe he had done anything wrong. He also felt the officers had not given him enough time to explain himself before restraining his hands with what he believes were zip ties.\n \n\n   \n  Three other protesters who also were trying to enter the building were arrested, he recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s just an over-policing example, because I walked up there with my hands out to my side, declared myself very openly, and said I’d like to enter the facility,” Mills said. “One hundred percent it was just to show an example of us.”\n \n\n   \n  Mills was escorted to a nearby curb, where he waited roughly 10 minutes for a police van that took him to the Broadview police station, where he was processed and given a citation, he recounted.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police cited him on suspicion of disobeying a police officer – a petty offense punishable by a fine – Cook County court records show, and is scheduled to appear in court November 25.\n \n\n   \n  The court documents do not offer a narrative of the arrest. State police did not directly respond to CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including about Mills’ claim that he did nothing wrong. Instead, they provided the same general statement they gave for Lee’s arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Mills has no regrets protesting and getting arrested because he’s standing up for his beliefs.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a shame that us peaceful protesters are being targeted instead of being encouraged to exercise our First Amendment rights,” Mills said.\n \n\n   \n  Mills objects to law enforcement officers being able to stop and ask people about their immigration status based at least in part on their  apparent ethnicity . A US Supreme Court ruling in a California case last month  appeared to clear the way  for a person’s ethnicity to be a  factor  behind immigration stops by law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Mills also does not support ICE’s roundups throughout Chicago of people accused of being in the country illegally.\n \n\n   \n  “We are doing the least that we can do to keep our neighbors safe, which is so important to us right now,” Mills said.\n \n\n   \n    School cafeteria worker tackled after threatening agents, authorities say\n \n\n   \n  Paul Ivery is a Chicago-area man with an intellectual disability who works at a high school cafeteria and admires and respects the police and first responders in his community – even saluting officers when he passes them – people who know him say.\n \n\n   \n  So it may have surprised acquaintances that for two weeks, he faced a felony charge of assaulting a federal officer at a protest at the ICE facility in Broadview.\n \n\n   \n  The case would draw numerous supporters, including his own mayor, to one of Ivery’s court hearings in an attempt to persuade a judge he wasn’t a threat. Ivery declined to be interviewed for this story, but a family representative, court filings and bystander video help chronicle a case that the government wanted prosecuted one moment but dismissed the next.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery walked from his home in Oak Park to the Broadview ICE facility on September 27 to join the demonstrations, family spokesperson Scott Sakiwama said.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery would later tell investigators he was there to “protest against ICE” because he believed that “ICE agents were disrespectful towards the Broadview Police Department and veterans,”  a criminal complaint filed against Ivery in federal court said,  without elaborating on his motivation.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was also upset that federal agents had been  deploying tear gas and shooting pepper balls at protesters  at Broadview, according to Sakiwama.\n \n\n   \n  At some point during the protest, Ivery approached a US Border Patrol agent and shouted something at him, according to the  complaint . While the agent couldn’t recall what was said, Ivery would admit to investigators later that he said, “I’ll (expletive) kill you right now,” and, “do something,” according to the document.\n \n\n   \n  After the shout, Ivery ran and jumped on top of an occupied vehicle as agents chased him, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Video from a bystander shows Ivery jumping off the vehicle, and an agent tackling him as he hits the pavement. Ivery yells as several agents restrain him. Nearby, other agents fire chemical irritants into the ground to keep bystanders away, appearing to cause some people to cough, the video shows . \n \n\n   \n  An onlooker asks Ivery for his name. Ivery yells it and says, “Help me!” Minutes later, after agents tied his hands behind his back and sat him up, an agent helps Ivery drink from a water bottle. Ivery is eventually pulled to his feet and led into the back of an unmarked vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  The complaint alleges that as agents were restraining Ivery, he grabbed an agent’s helmet and pulled it down, hurting the agent’s chin and exposing the agent to pepper spray.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was arrested and  charged  in federal court with felony assault on a federal officer, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was temporarily held at the Broadview ICE facility on the day of his arrest and transferred to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago that evening, Sakiwama said.\n \n\n   \n  Ivery was held for several days. But by October 1, prosecutors asked to have him released from jail and put on house arrest pending trial, acknowledging his disability,  CNN affiliate WLS-TV reported .\n \n\n   \n  At a hearing that day, a judge released Ivery on his own recognizance. Many of Ivery’s supporters, including Oak Park Mayor Vicki Scaman, were there to back him,  according to WLS .\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to the judge, Scaman said Ivery is a “valued member of our community” who stops and salutes police when he sees them on the street. She wrote that Ivery is not a threat to the community, and she hoped the judge would consider Ivery’s “special needs diagnosis.”\n \n\n   \n  On October 9, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charge altogether, and the judge ordered the dismissal the next day. The court records did not say why the case was dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  The US attorney’s office for Illinois’ northern district did not respond to CNN’s request for information about the dismissal. Ivery’s court-appointed attorney declined to be interviewed about the specifics of the case.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy for Mr. Ivery and the just resolution of his case and hope that others who are also having their First Amendment rights trampled by the government receive justice as well,” Ivery’s attorney and federal public defender Johanathan Brooks said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Bill Kirkos and Caroll Alvarado contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/uk/andrew-sandringham-estate-explained-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"09:04:00-05:00","title":"What we know about Sandringham, Andrew’s new home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a surge of public outrage over allegations that Prince Andrew had a relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, King Charles III has taken decisive action by stripping him of his royal titles and honors.

about Sandringham, Andrew’s new home \n       \n  By Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:04 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The rapid fall from grace of the now  former Prince Andrew , culminating in his humiliating exile by  King Charles III  to the Sandringham estate, has been no less than stunning.\n \n\n   \n  His titles and honors are in the process of being formally stripped – he will henceforth be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – and he’s been served notice to surrender his 75-year lease of  Royal Lodge , the huge mansion he has lived in for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  It is not yet known exactly when Andrew will leave Windsor, west of the British capital London, for the monarch’s retreat in rural Norfolk.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the sprawling estate that Andrew will soon call home.\n \n\n   \n    The late Queen’s favorite retreat\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has agreed to move out of the 30-room royal residence he has shared with his ex-wife  Sarah Ferguson  within the grounds of Windsor Great Park and into a new home in Sandringham. The estate was beloved by the late Queen Elizabeth II and is now said to be a favorite escape for Andrew’s elder brother King Charles and Queen Camilla.\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace is keen for Andrew to move to the country estate, roughly 100 miles north of London, as soon as is practical. But it will not happen immediately, a royal source told CNN on Friday. That’s because giving notice, surrendering the lease and other formalities related to the relocation - which is similar to buying a house - could make it a protracted process.\n \n\n   \n   Sandringham  was purchased in 1862 by Queen Victoria for her eldest son and heir Albert, later Edward VII, who had just turned 21. It has been the private home of five generations of British monarchs and is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas each year.\n \n\n   \n    Christmas family tradition\n \n\n   \n  Sandringham is perhaps the most famous stately home in Norfolk, on England’s east coast. The massive estate is spread across an estimated 20,000 acres, with 600 acres of royal parkland and some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  Since its purchase, each monarch has helped develop it over the years. The main house was completed in 1870, with a ballroom added 13 years later. Guest and staff accommodation came in the 1890s. It underwent a major overhaul in 1975 when more than 100 rooms in the service wing were demolished “to remove dry rot, save on heating costs and move the kitchens closer to the Dining Room,” according to the Sandringham website.\n \n\n   \n  The house was also the location for Queen Elizabeth II’s first televised Christmas broadcast in 1957.\n \n\n   \n  Within the grounds sits St. Mary Magdalene Church which is routinely used as a place of worship by the Windsors when in residence. It has become a tradition to see the family walk to it every Christmas morning, greeting well-wishers along the way.\n \n\n   \n  The estate also includes an organic farm, sawmill, residential and commercial properties, local parishes and communities.\n \n\n   \n  King George V described Sandringham as “the place I love better than anywhere else in the world” while his son and Queen Elizabeth II’s father George VI once wrote, “I have always been happy here and I love the place.”\n \n\n   \n  The property’s gardens were the first part of the estate to be opened to the public in 1908 by Edward VII. Elizabeth II later opened the main house to the public in 1977 to coincide with her silver jubilee year.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband Philip took responsibility for the estate’s management when Elizabeth acceeded to the throne in 1952. Conservation was at the heart of his approach to ensure that it was maintained for future generations.\n \n\n   \n    So where might Andrew live?\n \n\n   \n  No family members live at Sandringham House permanently these days, but King Charles frequently visits the grand property. Within its vast grounds there are several properties where the monarch could house his brother.\n \n\n   \n   York Cottage , previously known as Bachelor’s Cottage, was given to then-Duke and Duchess of York – the future George V and Queen Mary – as a wedding gift in 1893 by Edward VII. In recent years it has been used as accommodation for vacationers as well as estate staff and has also been used as the estate office for Sandringham, according to the Times of London. It was also reportedly considered for Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex before they stepped back as working royals.\n \n\n   \n   Gardens House  is another viable option. It was previously the home of the estate’s head gardener. The four-bed, three-bath property is currently being used as a holiday let. “This light and airy red brick Edwardian property accommodates up to eight guests, with each room thoughtfully furnished with a blend of rustic pieces, modern comforts, and botanical prints,” the Sandringham website reads.\n \n\n   \n   The Folly  is another available property on the estate. It too is being offered to travelers looking for the chance to “experience the serene splendour” of Sandringham. The original structure dates back to the 1800s and over the years has served as a hunting lodge and a space for ladies to enjoy afternoon tea. It can sleep six guests in its three bedrooms and features a wraparound balcony with a staircase that leads to a turret which “offers panoramic views across the estate,” according to its listing.\n \n\n   \n   Park House  is an additional property on the estate, but it would require some work. It was where Diana, the former Princess of Wales was born and spent much of her childhood. In the early 80s it was offered to charity Leonard Cheshire, which transformed it into a hotel for disabled people. There were plans for it to be renovated in 2019 which were put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n \n\n   \n   Wood Farm  is a farmhouse on the estate that has strong ties to Andrew’s parents. It is also where his father, Prince Philip, based himself after retiring from public duties in 2017 at the age of 95. However, it is not thought to be where Andrew will end up.\n \n\n   \n  Another option, though it seems incredibly unlikely, is  Anmer Hall,  which was gifted to Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales by the late Queen when they wed in 2013. The couple, along with their three children, do not live there permanently but are still thought to spend time during school breaks at the 10-bedroom Georgian property.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the move happening now?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is losing his royal titles and styles, as well as his Windsor home after weeks of snowballing scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Public fury was compounded after the publication of a  posthumous memoir from Virginia Giuffre  in October, in which she repeated her claims that she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions as a teenager while being trafficked by Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has always denied the claims made against him. But it is understood that the King took action after the recent developments sparked renewed outrage and threatened to taint the monarchy’s reputation further.\n \n\n   \n  His decision to essentially banish his disgraced brother to Sandringham came after consulting legal and constitutional experts, as well as his wider family and the government.\n \n\n   \n  Downing Street said Friday that it backed the King’s actions to remove Andrew’s titles and honors. “Our hearts go out to the family of Virginia Giuffre and all the victims who suffered from Jeffrey Epstein’s despicable crimes in all of this.

Despite her low public profile, she has played a key behind-the-scenes role in shaping the campaign’s visual identity, contributing to the use of familiar New York symbols like Metrocard orange-yellow, Mets blue, and firehouse red. Her artwork, which centers on Palestinian struggles and Middle Eastern women, aligns with Mamdani’s political stance and has helped amplify the campaign’s advocacy messaging. While Duwaji has not taken on an official role, her presence is felt through her support at key events, including rallies and media appearances, and through her personal narrative of cultural identity and activism.

independent advocacy over traditional visibility.","keyTakeAways":["Rama Duwaji has chosen not to participate in traditional first lady roles such as media appearances or campaign stunts, instead

 1:00 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rama Duwaji isn’t playing the traditional role of a first lady in waiting.\n \n\n   \n  She hasn’t stumped for  Zohran Mamdani , the New York City Democratic mayoral nominee and front-runner she married earlier this year. She hasn’t done a joint television appearance or agreed to a splashy magazine profile.\n \n\n   \n  And hardly anything on her Instagram page, where she promotes her artwork depicting Middle Eastern women and the plight of Palestinians, suggests that she even knows Mamdani, aside from one post on the day of the June Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  “Couldn’t possibly be prouder,”  she wrote  in the caption of a carousel of photos showing the couple together, a photo of herself voting early and a photo of Mamdani as a boy.\n \n\n   \n  If Mamdani wins Tuesday’s election, becoming the city’s first Muslim mayor and its youngest in a century, Duwaji too would be positioned to make and shape history. She would be the first member of Gen Z to serve as New York City’s first lady, a 28-year-old artist moving into Gracie Mansion under the relentless spotlight of America’s largest city.\n \n\n   \n  While she’s skipped traditional campaign set pieces, Duwaji has been present during key moments and has advised behind the scenes on social media and campaign iconography. She tagged along as Mamdani cast his primary vote early in the day, when many observers still thought he was  unlikely to beat former Gov. Andrew Cuomo , and joined Mamdani onstage when  he delivered his victory speech  that night.\n \n\n   \n  She accompanied Mamdani to his most recent appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.” And she was in the crowd, sitting alongside more than 10,000 people at a packed Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, to watch Mamdani make  his closing argument at a rally  headlined by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n \n\n   \n  It isn’t clear what, if any, official role Duwaji would have if Mamdani is elected mayor. She has declined interviews during the general election campaign, including a request from CNN for this story.\n \n\n   \n  But the last several months offer some clues.\n \n\n   \n    An awareness of what she was getting into\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji, who is of Syrian descent, was born in Houston and lived in Texas until her family moved to Dubai when she was 9. She briefly attended the Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar before transferring to the school’s Richmond campus to complete her degree. She later earned a master’s degree in illustration as visual essay from the School of Visual Arts in New York.\n \n\n   \n  Her illustrations have appeared in The Cut, the BBC, Vogue and The New Yorker.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji and Mamdani met on the dating app Hinge in 2021. Mamdani had recently been elected to the New York State Assembly, something Duwaji knew little about.\n \n\n   \n  Their first date would sound familiar to many of the young supporters of Mamdani’s campaign: They shared a meal at Qahwah House, a Yemeni coffee shop in Brooklyn, followed by a stroll in nearby McCarren Park. On their second date, Mamdani took Duwaji on a tour of his legislative district in Astoria, Queens.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Duwaji were engaged a few years later, in October 2024. Days after announcing their engagement on Instagram, Mamdani launched his campaign for mayor. They celebrated their engagement in Dubai that December, followed by a courthouse wedding this February at the city clerk’s office in Lower Manhattan. They posed for photos on the green couches of the marriage bureau’s waiting room, in front of a backdrop showing City Hall.\n \n\n   \n  Several months before the ceremony, Mamdani and Duwaji discussed how his plans to run for mayor could potentially change their lives, limit their privacy and likely thrust Duwaji into the public eye, according to a person familiar with the couple granted anonymity to share private details.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Mamdani launched his mayoral bid and questions began to swirl about the couple — “Socialist NYC mayoral contender Zohran Mamdani secretly tied the knot in exotic Dubai ceremony, photos show,” read a  New York Post headline  — he released their civil ceremony images on Instagram.\n \n\n   \n  “Rama isn’t just my wife, she’s an incredible artist who deserves to be known on her own terms,” Mamdani wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji, the person familiar with the couple said, knew what she was getting into. In the year that Mamdani has campaigned for mayor, she has been a major source of support, even if he falls asleep on the couch as they try to get through “Temptation Island” and the “Mission Impossible” series in 15- to 30-minute increments.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji helped finalize the campaign’s brand identity and worked on the final version of the campaign’s iconography and font, which showcases a distinct blend of colors easily identifiable to New Yorkers: Metrocard orange-yellow, New York Mets blue for shadow drops and backgrounds, and splashes of firehouse red. The font calls back to a time of bold-yellow bodega signs calling out to customers.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, whose mayoral bid has been powered by his use of social media, also credits Duwaji with improving the campaign’s digital sensibilities.\n \n\n   \n  He has sometimes been peppered with questions about his young marriage and the couple’s future. At a recent press conference where Mamdani was highlighting his proposal to provide newborn New Yorkers and their families with “baby baskets,” he was asked whether he planned on having any children soon.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like I’m talking to my mother,” the 34-year-old responded with a laugh, adding that for now, he is focused on the mayoral race.\n \n\n   \n    A focus on the Palestinian cause\n \n\n   \n  Traditionally, first spouses thrust into high-profile support roles host events, back causes that complement their partner’s agenda, and keep their more controversial opinions to themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Duwaji’s political views speak loudly through her art, which features black-and-white illustrations depicting Middle Eastern women, severe hunger in Gaza and the Palestinian flag. Those posts broadly align with her husband’s  criticisms of the Israeli government  and its conduct of the war following Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks, comments that have at times  roiled New York City’s Jewish population , the largest outside Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “What she is posting has been in line with many of the things that Mamdani has talked about,” said Lisa Burns, a professor of media studies at Quinnipiac University who has studied the role of first ladies. “I’m starting to see some of that work merging, where the advocacy work that she is doing will support the work he is doing — even if it’s separate — as opposed to detracting from it.”\n \n\n   \n  In an April  interview  with Yung, a quarterly magazine focused on art from Africa and the Middle East, Duwaji said she creates her work “for people who care about the things I care about.”\n \n\n   \n  “With so many people being pushed out and silenced by fear, all I can do is use my voice to speak out about what’s happening in the US and Palestine and Syria as much as I can,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    A role to be defined\n \n\n   \n  New York City is no stranger to mayoral spouses with their own public profiles.\n \n\n   \n  Mayor Bill de Blasio’s then-wife, Chirlane McCray, was a staple of his campaign and administration, providing input on staff picks and high-profile appointments. Part of de Blasio’s  appeal to voters  was how his multiracial family had helped shape his worldview.\n \n\n   \n  A 2013  New York Times profile  of McCray described her and de Blasio as being “as much a package deal as Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton.” Political meetings were set around her schedule, and McCray sat in on key job interviews. She was assigned oversight of a mental health initiative that brought her in front of the City Council during budget negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Diana Taylor, the longtime partner of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, was a former government official and finance executive who didn’t define herself by the role.\n \n\n   \n  “Her famous boyfriend may be the least interesting thing about her,” then-Vogue editor Anna Wintour, a friend of Taylor’s, told  The Washington Post  in 2020 when Bloomberg was running for president. “She’s intelligent, independent — and completely her own person.”\n \n\n   \n  For now, Duwaji’s presence can’t be seen by most New Yorkers, even if it is felt quietly by her husband’s campaign.\n \n\n   \n  At a recent “sip and pour” event at a senior citizen center in Brooklyn intended to get out the vote, Mamdani tried to follow along as an art instructor showed the group how to draw a fall landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Brush in hand and a paper plate with dots of paint as a palette, Mamdani tried to tamp down expectations.\n \n\n   \n  “I have to warn you all, I’m not very good at painting,” he said, adding the last time he had painted anything was on a date with his wife. Mamdani then began to draw. Asked later about the quality of his sketch, he said, “Don’t tell my wife.”\n \n\n   \n  A campaign aide had already done so, texting a photo of his attempt to draw a tree.\n \n\n   \n  She fired back: “That is a triangle.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/tech/saudi-arabia-ai-powerhouse","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Saudi Arabia is making a massive bet on becoming a global AI powerhouse","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Saudi Arabia is transforming its economy by investing oil wealth into becoming a global AI leader through its homegrown company Humain.

oil wealth toward its massive AI ambitions.\n \n\n   \n  Its chief investment vehicle is Humain, a homegrown company that is building out a full stack of data centers, cloud capabilities, large language models and applications. It’s owned by the Kingdom’s nearly $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund.\n \n\n   \n  Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman  unveiled Humain in May  ahead of President Donald Trump’s  state visit to Riyadh . This week, at the annual Future Investment Initiative in the same location, the scale, ambition and deep pockets behind the project came into clearer focus.\n \n\n   \n  Humain CEO, Tareq Amin, is setting out to make Saudi Arabia the world’s third-largest AI market, after the United States and China. It’s a bold ambition for a newcomer to the industry, but Amin argues the Kingdom’s competitive edge lies in its abundant and cheap energy resources that can feed the seemingly insatiable demand for computing power.\n \n\n   \n  “We have an advantage in Saudi Arabia,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “Look at this country’s amazing energy grid that doesn’t require a company like Humain to build the substations and the power to deliver that to a data center. That means I have saved 18 months of time.”\n \n\n   \n  Humain plans to build up to six gigawatts in data center capability across the country by 2034, with a rolodex of key AI partners, including Nvidia, AMD, Amazon Web Services, Qualcomm and Cisco.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Humain announced a  $3 billion deal  with private equity giant Blackstone to build data centers in the Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  It also publicly launched  Humain One , an AI-powered operating system where users speak or type to a computer to tell it to perform tasks, rather than clicking on icons, as is conventional in systems like Windows or iOS.\n \n\n   \n  Humain has been using the AI system internally to run much of its HR, finance, legal, operational and IT departments. Amin says there is now only one employee in his payroll department, with AI agents handling the rest.\n \n\n   \n  The Kingdom is entering the closing stretch of its Vision 2030 economic transformation plan facing headwinds from declining oil prices and delays in its construction of giga-projects like Neom, placing new urgency on its AI push to support the growth of the Arab world’s largest economy.\n \n\n   \n  It also  faces competition  from the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which has its own AI vehicle, G42, and recently secured a landmark deal with the Trump administration to build “ Stargate UAE ,” a sprawling $500 billion data center project billed as the largest outside the United States, with the help of OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether there’s room for two regional heavyweights, Amin said he supports democratizing AI, while touting Humain’s robust operations.\n \n\n   \n  “It is good for humanity to have knowledge — especially around AI — not to be all centralized in one location. So it’s good what is happening in the UAE. It’s very good what’s happening in Saudi Arabia,” he said. “I will tell you what we decided to do, which is very different … Humane is not a holding company. We are an operating company.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/zohran-mamdani-jewish-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"11:30:00-05:00","title":"‘I hate my choices’: How Zohran Mamdani’s run for mayor has split Jews in New York","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The mayoral race in New York City has become a flashpoint for deep divisions within the Jewish community, particularly over Zohran Mamdani’s pro-Palestinian and critical stance toward Israel.

But his positions on Israel were just too much for Needleman to accept.\n \n\n   \n  “If I try and bend that far, I’ll break,” he said, quoting the musical “Fiddler on the Roof.”\n \n\n   \n  His comments reflect what has been a fraught debate, among Jews in New York and elsewhere, ahead of the city’s mayoral election Tuesday. Jewish voters have long reliably  supported Democrats , and Mamdani won the Democratic primary, but concerns about rising antisemitism and Mamdani’s sharp criticisms of Israel have opened up a generational split and raised deeper questions what it means to be an American Jew in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  This election has shown clearly that “Jews and Jewish voters are not a monolith,” said Phylisa Wisdom, the director of the New York Jewish Agenda, an advocacy group promoting liberal Jewish New Yorkers.\n \n\n   \n  “Folks have been really trying to reckon with how much does it matter that they have a mayor that has their same feelings about Israel,” she said. “There are some who feel like it’s not the most important thing to me when I’m voting for mayor, how they feel about Israel, and there are some who think it’s existential, and they couldn’t vote for someone who disagrees with them on Israel or doesn’t support Israel as a Jewish state.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue stems from Mamdani’s history of pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel activism, from his college days when he started a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, to his support for the  Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement  against Israel, to his pledge to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  In more recent months, Mamdani has tempered some of his most controversial positions and tried to reassure Jewish voters worried about antisemitic attacks like the ones in  Washington, DC , and  Boulder, Colorado . Democratic Jewish politicians like City Comptroller  Brad Lander  and Rep.  Jerry Nadler  have endorsed him, though US Sen. Chuck Schumer remains a notable holdout.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone has been convinced.\n \n\n   \n  “Shabbat Shalom. To be clear, unequivocal, and on the record: I believe Zohran Mamdani poses a danger to the security of the New York Jewish community,”  Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove  of Park Avenue Synagogue told his congregation on October 18.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,100 rabbis and Jewish leaders across the US soon  signed an open letter  agreeing with Cosgrove’s message and calling on Americans to “stand up for candidates who reject antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s rise comes amid a growing split in the American Jewish electorate, particularly along age lines, about Israel in the wake of the war in Gaza the last two years. While 56% of Jewish Americans say they are emotionally attached to Israel, that number falls to 36% among those aged 18 to 34, according to polling from  The Washington Post .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a tense time in the Jewish family group chats,” Ezra Klein wrote in  The New York Times  this summer.\n \n\n   \n  While Mamdani is ahead among likely voters in most public polls, recent polls from  Fox News  and  Marist  both had 55% of Jewish likely voters in the city backing former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running an independent campaign after losing to Mamdani in the June Democratic primary. Mamdani had 32% with Jewish voters in each poll.\n \n\n   \n  For voters like Cosgrove, Mamdani’s position on Israel is a dealbreaker. Others, like those in the progressive activist group  Jewish Voices for Peace , see it as a positive. Still many other Jews see Mamdani’s views on Israel as less important than his other proposed policies: freezing increases on the city’s rent-stabilized apartments, focusing on affordability and standing up to President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Not to mention Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa have their own drawbacks.\n \n\n   \n  “I hate my choices,” said Cydney Schwartz, a 33-year-old liberal Democrat who has lived in Israel.\n \n\n   \n    What Mamdani has said about Israel and Jews\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel advocacy have been a key throughline of his political beliefs.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has declined to say he believes Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state, saying the country should provide equal rights to all residents. He previously refused to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada,” referencing an Arabic term used by Palestinians to describe their uprising against Israel. He has recently said he  would discourage the use  of the phrase.\n \n\n   \n  A day after the  October 7, 2023 , Hamas attacks on Israel, which sparked the devastating war in Gaza,  Mamdani issued  a statement that did not condemn Hamas or the attacks. He has repeatedly criticized Israel’s actions as a “ genocide ” and said he would arrest Netanyahu if he visits New York, citing a warrant from the  International Criminal Court , of which the US is not a member.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, a September 2023 video of him connecting New York Police Department oppression to the Israel Defense Forces spread widely online.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it’s been laced by the IDF,”  he said  then at a Democratic Socialists of America convention.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about that line last week, he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper, “It was a reference to training exercises that have taken place between the NYPD and the IDF.”\n \n\n   \n  “So do you still believe that the NYPD is basically working hand in glove with the IDF?” Cooper asked.\n \n\n   \n  “No. What I’ve made very clear is those are training exercises that are of concern to me,” Mamdani replied. “And what my focus is, is on working with the NYPD to actually deliver public safety for New Yorkers across the five boroughs.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, after his victory in the Democratic primary, he pledged to “understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree and to wrestle deeply with those disagreements.”\n \n\n   \n  During Rosh Hashanah, Mamdani attended services at Kolot Chayeinu, one of Brooklyn’s most progressive synagogues. For Yom Kippur, considered the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, Mamdani attended services at Lab Shul, a non-denominational Jewish congregation, accompanied by Jewish political allies in Nadler and Lander.\n \n\n   \n  He has met with Hasidic leaders, including two prominent rabbis from Williamsburg’s Satmar community, an ultra-Orthodox sect with its own set of demands for city government.\n \n\n   \n  He has promised he would keep in place police protection for the city’s annual parade honoring Israel. And he has said  he would not have an Israel-related  litmus test for working in his administration.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m going to have people in my administration who are Zionists,” he said, according to  The Free Press .\n \n\n   \n    How Jewish New Yorkers feel\n \n\n   \n  “Two Jews, three opinions,” goes the old joke, a play on the religion’s tradition of debate, and that was evident in conversations with liberal Jews voting for mayor Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re figuring it out,” Wisdom said. “There’s a lot of out-loud figuring it out.”\n \n\n   \n  Schwartz, the 33-year-old liberal who has lived in Israel, said she feels a powerful connection to the country. Still, she said, she didn’t agree with Israel’s politics or Netanyahu, similarly to how she disagrees with Trump’s politics in the US.\n \n\n   \n  She considered not voting, but ultimately picked a candidate, who she declined to share. “I want to focus on the city I live in,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  David, a 29-year-old wearing a yarmulke who declined to give his last name, said the vote felt like an “existential” decision. He said he didn’t particularly care about how the mayor feels about Israel, but Mamdani’s focus on Israeli-Palestinian politics made it hard to believe he’s not antisemitic, and he worried whether that could bleed into other policies.\n \n\n   \n  He said he planned to vote for Cuomo “reluctantly.” “He’s bad on everything,” David said of his preferred choice. “He’s a bad person.”\n \n\n   \n  Eric Weltman, a 58-year-old wearing a suit and tie, proudly said he voted for Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s smart, competent, principled and progressive,” he said, adding he had no qualms about Mamdani’s positions on Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s going to be mayor of New York, not ambassador to Israel,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As for Needleman, the 77-year-old who quoted “Fiddler,” he said he couldn’t support Mamdani and felt Cuomo was too dishonest. So he decided to vote for Sliwa even though he disagreed with the Republican’s politics, saying Sliwa seemed like a “decent guy.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/democrats-shutdown-politics","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Democrats Are Winning the Shutdown Politics.

Can they stop now? \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After the 2013 government shutdown ended, Republican leaders made clear they had only been humoring Sen. Ted Cruz and his plot to defund Obamacare.\n \n\n   \n  “It was not a smart play. It had no chance of success,” then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  said .\n \n\n   \n  Then-House Speaker John Boehner initially said the GOP had “fought the good fight.” But he would later say the plan “ never had a chance ” and even called the Texas senator “ Lucifer in the flesh .”\n \n\n   \n  This is how shutdowns generally go. The side seeking a concession fights what they view as “the good fight,” and then they give up when it becomes clear that it’s also a losing fight. Because, as McConnell has often said, shutdowns don’t work.\n \n\n   \n  And maybe that’s how Democrats thought this one would go down. House Speaker Mike Johnson basically predicted as much Saturday, wagering Democrats might  back down after Tuesday’s elections .\n \n\n   \n  But a full month into the shutdown, it’s hard to see how Democrats can give up now. The politics of this have gone surprisingly well for them. And Republicans seem to be the ones struggling for a path forward.\n \n\n   \n  Much can change as some of the biggest impacts of the shutdown  start to hit this weekend  and in the coming weeks. But we’re in a very different kind of shutdown this time — one where it’s much tougher to see the politics forming an obvious off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The polling on blame has been remarkably constant since before the shutdown began. People continue to blame President Donald Trump and the Republicans more than Democrats by double-digit margins in most surveys. That margin was  45%-33%  in a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  A  Yahoo News-YouGov poll , meanwhile, showed 46% said they blamed “conservative Republicans” a lot for the shutdown — more than the 38% who blamed “progressive Democrats” that much.\n \n\n   \n  Surveys also continue to show that Democrats’ policy demand, an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies, remains popular with more than 7 in 10 Americans.\n \n\n   \n  That Yahoo survey also suggested a problem for Republicans that we haven’t seen tested in previous polling.\n \n\n   \n  It showed Americans said by a nearly 3-to-1 margin — 63%-21% — that they disapproved of the firings of thousands of federal workers during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  This was, of course, Trump’s big threat to Democrats. He made a big show of casting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as the grim reaper ready to target Democratic employees and programs for cuts — even as some Republicans  cautioned the White House  that such cuts could squander the GOP’s political advantages. Then the administration  followed through .\n \n\n   \n  But it  doesn’t seem to have dissuaded Democrats from pressing forward. And there’s now reason to believe those Republicans had a point about these cuts backfiring on the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, much of the GOP’s handling of this seems rather haphazard. And Friday was a case in point.\n \n\n   \n  The day started with Republicans dealing with a curveball from Trump, who decided late Thursday to suddenly urge them to nuke the filibuster to end the shutdown. This completely impractical idea also  legitimized a key Democratic talking point  — that Republicans could end the shutdown any time they want.\n \n\n   \n  Then Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made a few seemingly unhelpful comments about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, also known as food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  She at one point said that if people really needed them that badly, then “ we have failed you .” House Speaker Mike Johnson soon stepped in to clarify that the “we” somehow meant, “we, the Democrats.” (Neither Rollins nor Johnson is, in fact, a Democrat.)\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Rollins was noncommittal when asked whether the administration would abide by a judge’s order for it to release emergency SNAP funds, saying, “We’re looking at all the options.”\n \n\n   \n  It was a stunning response — not just because ignoring court orders could trigger a constitutional crisis, but also because it would mean the administration would be taking such a drastic step to prevent poor people from getting food.\n \n\n   \n  A  pair of federal judges  soon ordered the administration to release the emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits. But ahead of the rulings, Republicans did a great job making themselves out to be opposed to this — and even ready to fight against it. (Trump on Friday night ultimately indicated he  would do what he could to fund SNAP .)\n \n\n   \n  Another major factor here is what the shutdown could do for Democrats. It’s early, but there is evidence this has led to something of a badly needed rallying effect on the left.\n \n\n   \n  The reason the Democratic Party has seen some of its worst poll numbers in history this year is largely because Democrats themselves have lost faith in their party. But a  Quinnipiac University poll  last week showed 58% of Democratic voters suddenly approved of their party’s congressional contingent.\n \n\n   \n  That’s still not great. But it is up nearly 20 points from where it was between February and July, when that number hovered around 40%.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats would seem to have relatively little reason to back down — and plenty of reason to stick with their demands that Republicans come to the table on extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. Imagine a situation in which they have these seeming political advantages and they throw in the towel anyways. It’s not difficult to see that reigniting a backlash on the left.\n \n\n   \n  And in case that danger wasn’t clear, witness a newly released Pew Research Center poll. It asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who expressed frustration with the party what the main reason for that was. Far and away, the most-cited reason was not fighting hard enough against the Trump administration,  which 41% cited .\n \n\n   \n  If you’re a Democrat, it’s hard to look at all of that and not want to at least let things play out. You might think the  premium increases  that people are seeing on their Obamacare plans after open enrollment began Saturday could shift the politics even more in your favor. And maybe you’ve got a little more confidence in how the SNAP issue is going to play.\n \n\n   \n  You might even start to think that, at the end of this long journey, there could be something more valuable than a moral victory.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/americas/mexico-sonora-fire-dozens-killed-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"11:57:00+00:00","title":"Fire at general store kills at least 23 in northern Mexico, state governor says","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fire at a Waldo’s general store in Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora state in northern Mexico, killed at least 23 people, including minors, with 11 injured.

life-threatening injuries on Saturday night after a stabbing attack on a train in central England that Prime Minister Keir Starmer described as “deeply concerning.”\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested after the attack, which British Transport Police (BTP) declared “a major incident,” adding that counterterrorism officers were supporting the investigation. BTP also declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before later rescinding this.\n \n\n   \n  Police said 10 people were taken to hospital, nine of whom suffered life-threatening injuries. No fatalities have been reported from the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Officers were called at at 7.42 p.m. to a report of the attack on the service from the northern city of Doncaster to London’s King’s Cross. Armed officers were deployed to Huntingdon station, where the train made an unplanned stop and the two people were arrested, police said.\n \n\n   \n  More than 12 hours after the incident, police had yet to reveal details about the suspected attackers.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Defence Minister John Healey told Sky News on Sunday that the incident appeared to be an “isolated attack.”\n \n\n   \n    Passenger saw suspect tasered\n \n\n   \n  Wren Chambers, who was on the train when the attack happened, told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down.\n \n\n   \n  “A minute or so later a man… was running down with a very clear wound, bleeding quite badly on his arm. And I thought it was like some sort of Halloween prank at first. But then he’s shouting that someone’s got a knife, he was stabbed,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  After seeing more people running down the train, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get far down the train as they can.”\n \n\n   \n  Another witness who was traveling on the train said he saw an “extremely bloodied” victim. The man, who gave his name as Gavin, told Sky News he believed he saw a suspect tasered before he was arrested.\n \n\n   \n  He said police shouted “Get down, get down” as they got closer to him.\n \n\n   \n  “He then was waving a knife, quite a large knife, and then they detained him,” the eyewitness said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Another male passenger, Olly Foster, told the Daily Mail he’d been listening to an audiobook when the attack happened. “A young girl was distraught as the attacker tried to stab her, but a hero of an older man got in the way taking a gash on his forehead and I think another on his neck,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Video shared on social media of the immediate aftermath of the incident showed a bloodied person rushing out of Huntingdon station and dozens of police and emergency vehicles with flashing blue lights gathered outside. In one video armed officers were seen sprinting down a platform at the station toward the front end of a stationary train.\n \n\n   \n  British Transport Police Chief Superintendent Chris Casey called it “a shocking incident” and said his thoughts were with those injured and their families.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re conducting urgent enquiries to establish what has happened, and it could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything further,” he said. “At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident.”\n \n\n   \n    Large-scale response\n \n\n   \n  Emergency first responders said they had mobilized a large-scale response to the stabbing attack, including sending several air ambulances.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement on X, the East of England Ambulance Service said it had sent “numerous ambulances, tactical commanders, our Hazardous Area Response Team, and critical care teams,” from several regional jurisdictions.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer said on social media: “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” he said on X.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”   \n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said she is receiving regular updates on the investigation and urged people to avoid “speculation at this early stage” as to what was behind the stabbings.\n \n\n   \n  The rail company that operates trains on the East Coast Main Line, London North Eastern Railway (LNER), said that it was “experiencing major disruption across the LNER route.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.\n \n\n   \n  “Our advice is ‘Do Not Travel’. Please defer your travel where you can,” LNER said.\n \n\n   \n  It remains unclear at this stage what crimes the attackers will be charged with. Homicide rates in the UK are low compared to other Western nations. Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics. In comparison knife crime has risen overall since 2011, although a 1% decrease was recorded over the past year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/trump-pentagon-nigeria-action","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"19:59:00-05:00","title":"Trump says he’s ordered Pentagon to ‘prepare for possible action’ in Nigeria","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced on November 1, 2025, that he had ordered the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action in Nigeria, accusing the country of failing to protect Christians from violent attacks by Islamic extremists.

US President Donald Trump said Saturday he has ordered the Defense Department to prepare for possible military action in Nigeria as he continues to accuse the nation of not doing enough to stem violence against Christians — an accusation Nigeria has repeatedly denied.\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post criticizing what he called the “mass slaughter” of Christians in the country, Trump  wrote  the United States would “immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria” and warned the government there to “move fast.”\n \n\n   \n  In the lengthy message, Trump said the US “may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’ to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”\n \n\n   \n  Both Christians and Muslims have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists in the country of more than 230 million people. The violence in the country is driven by varying factors: some incidents are religiously motivated and affect both groups, while others arise from disputes between farmers and herders over limited resources, as well as communal and ethnic tensions.\n \n\n   \n  Although Christians are among those targeted, local reports indicate that most victims are Muslims living in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north.\n \n\n   \n  “I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action,” Trump wrote. “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!”\n \n\n   \n  “Yes sir,” US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth posted on social media with a screenshot of Trump’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “The killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria — and anywhere — must end immediately. The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s announcement comes after he accused Nigeria of religious freedom violations on Friday, claiming that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and designating the nation as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the  International Religious Freedom Act . The label is a suggestion that his administration has found that Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post after the designation, but before Trump’s mention of the military, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu  wrote : “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that Nigeria is “working with the United States government and the international community to deepen understanding and cooperation on protection of communities of all faiths.”\n \n\n   \n  Tinubu’s press secretary, responding to a social media post from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemning the “slaughter of thousands of Christians,” called the characterization “a gross exaggeration of the Nigerian situation,” adding that “Christians, Muslims, churches and mosques are attacked randomly.”\n \n\n   \n  “What our country requires from America is military support to fight these violent extremists in some states of our country, not designation as a nation of particular concern,” said Bayo Onanuga.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespersons for the White House and Tinubu’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/pennsylvania-catholic-school-halloween-float-holocaust-imagery","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00Z","title":"Pennsylvania diocese condemns Holocaust imagery displayed on Catholic school’s Halloween parade float","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Catholic school in Hanover, Pennsylvania, displayed a replica of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp gate with the phrase 'Arbeit Macht Frei' during a Halloween parade float, prompting the Diocese of Harrisburg to issue a strong condemnation.

The slogan above the Auschwitz Concentration Camp gate was made by prisoners, who deliberately reversed the letter B as “a camouflaged mark of disobedience,” the website says.\n \n\n   \n  The school in Hanover, Pennsylvania ,  is part of the Diocese of Harrisburg, which called the imagery “a notorious symbol of hate” in a  statement  Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Bishop Timothy C.

As Catholics, we stand firmly against all forms of antisemitism, hatred, and prejudice, which are rampant in our society,” Senior added. “The Church’s relationship with the Jewish community is one of deep respect, friendship, and shared faith in the one true God.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the St. Joseph Catholic School for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The incident comes amid a surge in recent reports of antisemitic acts.

Now in the US, he’s looking for a way forward \n       \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Motaz Azaiza has witnessed the horrors of war. Now he’s trying to restore his faith in humanity. For 107 days, he was a photojournalist on the front lines of a warzone in his own familiar neighborhoods, documenting the carnage wrought by relentless Israeli airstrikes in such raw and unedited detail that it was impossible to ignore.\n \n\n   \n  Since mainstream news organizations were unable to film inside Gaza, Azaiza, like other Palestinian journalists in the strip, recorded the early days of the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two years, more than 68,000 people have been killed, according to local health officials in the enclave, and with over 90% of the residential buildings destroyed, most of the population has been internally displaced.\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza knows that he’s lucky to be alive. “My life is worth more now than if I was dead,” he told CNN earlier this month. “A lot of Gazans got killed. Nobody mentions their names.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 21 months since Azaiza escaped with his immediate family to Qatar; he’s now living in New York. He’s been working with aid groups to help the people of Gaza, and says he has raised $60 million and saved numerous lives. He recently launched a foundation to continue fundraising for Palestinians in Gaza, saying it will help to provide food and pastries, tanker trucks of clean water, blankets and shelter. “A candle in the darkness” is how he describes the Motaz Foundation to his Instagram followers, encouraging those in need to personally reach out for help.\n \n\n   \n  When asked at a recent event at the Muslim Wellness Center in Roswell, Georgia, why he named it after himself, he said that he simply couldn’t think of anything else to call it. But he’s proud of the work and it’s giving him purpose as he works through the traumatic upheaval of his life.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe this makes me forget the mental suffering that I’m in,” he pondered, leaning on the back of a pickup truck behind a Yemeni coffee shop which had just hosted a fundraising event for the foundation. “The moment I wire funds to people and get aid, support, and food, I feel high!” As he navigates a maelstrom of emotions, both his torment and his exhilaration are evident. “I’ve never been a useless person,” he said, “I’m always trying to be useful at every step.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 240 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led terror attack, in which more than 1,200 were killed and about 250 taken hostage, prompting Israel’s fierce military response. Israel denies targeting reporters, but Gaza has become the deadliest conflict zone ever for them, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he was receiving death threats via anonymous phone calls shortly before he left the strip and he knows that his story could easily have ended there. Does coming so close to death make him feel more alive? It’s complicated. “Yeah,” he responds, “because you don’t have anything to lose.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he has lost countless friends in Gaza. But he also feels as though he is dead inside. “My soul is turned off,” he said. Sometimes he felt lucky to survive – and luckier to escape – wrestling even now with survivors’ guilt, as do others who managed to flee the war  or  have witnessed it unfold from afar. “This is the feeling that people want me to feel,” he explains. “Or Israel wants me to feel, because if they defeat you inside then they don’t need to do anything else. I have it, but I’m trying not to allow it to control (me).”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he always wanted to be a photographer, but if violence hadn’t beaten a path to his door, then he would never have sought it out. He preferred taking artistic shots of bustling marketplaces or kids playing on the beach and resented that the outside world only seemed to be interested in paying for his work when he and Gaza’s other photojournalists competed for images depicting the most visceral scenes of the aftermath of an airstrike. His documentation of Israel’s response to the October 7 attack delivered him a massive social media following and professional success – his photo from October 31, 2023 of a woman trapped in a pancaked apartment building in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza was recognized as one of Time magazine’s  top 10 photographs of the year . But unlike his industry peers in other countries, he couldn’t celebrate the achievement because only his community’s extreme suffering had given him the opportunity to succeed.\n \n\n   \n    Dreams of war\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he feels that, somehow, fate chose him to be a bridge between the carnage in Gaza and the world outside, and he confides now that he foresaw his future many times before the war. Azaiza  would often dream of running through the streets in a press vest, a building next to him would blow up and he would bang his head on the ground before waking up, he said. The dream made no sense to him. “And then I found myself in the vest,” he said, “in the helmet, in the car (passing) the building that I saw in my dream. It was on fire. A lot of things that I imagined happened.”\n \n\n   \n  A young lady stood up to address him during one of the fundraising events in Georgia. “Thank you for opening our eyes,” she said, her voice cracking with emotion as she wiped tears from her cheeks. “Thank you for being alive, for being here. I’m so grateful for you.” Another man stood and hailed him a hero. “I’m not a hero,” Azaiza deflected, “I’m not Superman. I still have to wait in line for the toilet.”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza never wanted to be famous and, although he has more than 15 million followers on Instagram, he says that he’s the same man he was on October 6, 2023, just with more pressure on his shoulders. He’s learned the hard way that it’s impossible to stay out of politics when it comes to Gaza, where so many competing factions have their own agendas to promote; some of the people who used to applaud him now envy him and troll him with abuse on social media instead, he said. The hateful words are in some ways worse than the bullets, he said, because at least one knows how a bullet will hurt.\n \n\n   \n  “But this,” he paused for emphasis, “eats you from the inside, makes your heart tight, makes your stomach not able to eat, makes you overthink. And it hurts others around you, hurts your mom. The keyboard warriors, this is how Israel (can) win. They don’t need to divide us, we’re already divided.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s grateful for the ceasefire, and an end to the killing, but he doesn’t think it’s fair to the Palestinians. “I just wanted the genocide to stop,” he explained. “We’ve been calling for it to stop since October 9. Give them (Israel) the hostages. But nobody listened to us until we lost it all.\n \n\n   \n  “Now it sounds like peace that is giving Israel more peace and more power, they got what they wanted after the massacre, the whole strip. Maybe it’s going to last, because, like, there’s nothing left.”\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, echoing the findings of other genocide experts and human rights groups, all of which Israel has rejected.\n \n\n   \n  For now, Azaiza is focused on his humanitarian work but living in a kind of limbo. He dreams of returning to Gaza to build a home by the sea but wonders what kind of life he would be returning to. He says he’d like to be Gaza’s Minister of Youth one day but knows that many politicians become corrupt; he’d love to start a family too.\n \n\n   \n  Most of all, he dreams of working with his camera in a simpler life. “You know Tarzan?” he asked rhetorically. “I want to be Tarzan with a camera. I wish to go to Tanzania with my camera, capture lions and animals. I don’t want to capture any human anymore, humans bring problems, bring pain, and bring troubles. No humans anymore, only animals, that’s it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/snap-benefits-november-most-affected-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:55:00Z","title":"Millions of Americans Could Face Delays in SNAP Benefits Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to a government shutdown, millions of Americans relying on SNAP food assistance faced delays in receiving their benefits in November 2025.

Lumer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:39 AM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military carried out another  deadly strike on alleged drug-traffickers  at sea on Saturday, continuing a monthslong campaign by the Trump administration that has been widely criticized as likely illegal.\n \n\n   \n  The latest strike targeted a boat in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said three men, whom he identified as “narco-terrorists,” were killed in the operation, which he said was carried out in international waters. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n  The boat was “carrying narcotics” and “transiting along a known narco-trafficking route,” Hegseth said, citing US intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s attack marks the 15th known US military strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel since the Trump administration began the operations in early September. The strikes, which have been carried out in the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, have killed a total of 64 people.\n \n\n   \n  “These narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home—and they will not succeed. The Department will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda,” Hegseth said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s strike is the first targeting a boat in the Caribbean since October 24. After concentrating on the region initially, the Pentagon in recent weeks deliberately refocused its efforts against suspected drug traffickers to the eastern Pacific,  CNN reported  Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The shift was made because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, according to people familiar with the matter. Six known strikes have been carried out in the Pacific over the last two weeks, including three conducted in a single day last week.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in Congress and international leaders have questioned the legality of the Trump administration’s accelerating strikes.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the strikes  violate international law  and called for them to stop.\n \n\n   \n  “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats,” human rights commissioner Volker Türk said, according to a statement released by his office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers,  CNN previously reported . The opinion argues that the president is allowed to authorize deadly force against a broad range of cartels because they pose an imminent threat to Americans.\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers have accused the administration of lacking transparency about the strikes. A  closed-door briefing Thursday  lacked critical details and Pentagon lawyers were pulled from the session at the last minute, Democrats asserted last week.\n \n\n   \n  A day earlier, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner blasted the Trump administration for holding a briefing that day on the strikes but  not telling Democrats about it , calling the move “a partisan stunt.”\n \n\n   \n  While traveling in Asia on Friday, Hegseth insisted he had engaged Congress on a bipartisan basis regarding the strikes. However, that same day, Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, a Republican, and Ranking Member Jack Reed, a Democrat, released two letters they said they sent Hegseth over the past month seeking details about the operations but that have gone unanswered.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, Kaanita Iyer, and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/africa/western-kenya-landslide-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:09:00Z","title":"Landslide in western Kenya leaves 21 dead, 30 others missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly landslide in Chesongoch, a hilly area of Elgeyo Marakwet County in western Kenya, killed at least 21 people and left 30 others missing due to heavy rains during the country’s short rains season.

Trump administration to use emergency funds to partially cover food stamp benefits \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:40 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover  food stamp benefits  for tens of millions of Americans in November.\n \n\n   \n  The rulings from judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island reject a controversial US Department of Agriculture claim that it could not use a contingency fund, which the agency says has $5.3 billion remaining in it, to help cover the benefits amid the month-long government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, President Donald Trump said he has instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible because the attorneys “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available.”\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social Friday evening. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, costs between $8 billion and $9 billion a month, so the judges’ orders will not cover all of the needed payments for November.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt that the … contingency funds are appropriated funds that are without a doubt necessary to carry out the program’s operation.” US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island said. “The shutdown of the government through funding doesn’t do away with SNAP, it just does away with the funding of it.”\n \n\n   \n  During proceedings Friday, McConnell said he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure at least some benefits could be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur, if it hasn’t already occurred, in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In a written ruling released Saturday, McConnell wrote that the administration must make a partial payment to SNAP beneficiaries using the contingency funds by Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But he wrote the USDA should, within its discretion, find additional funds to provide full benefits to recipients. If the agency chooses this option, it must make the full payment by the end of Monday, as making the full payment is simpler than calculating partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  In his ruling, McConnell also responded directly to Trump’s comments Friday, writing, “the Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”\n \n\n   \n  McConnell’s ruling during a hastily scheduled hearing came minutes after US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston made a similar order. Both judges, appointees of President Barack Obama, also said that USDA is allowed to tap into another bucket of money of nearly $17 billion to pay November SNAP benefits in full, but that decision is currently up to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program. And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds … to avoid any reductions,”  Talwani said in a 15-page order. \n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration opposes tapping into those other funds, arguing in court it will hurt the child nutrition programs that the revenue supports.\n \n\n   \n  Even with Trump’s directive and the judge’s rulings, millions of recipients will still face delays in getting their benefits, which were scheduled to start being distributed on November 1. It will take time for the Department of Agriculture and states to get the money flowing again.\n \n\n   \n  In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  The Boston lawsuit was filed earlier this week by a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the case in Rhode Island was brought Thursday by a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could seek appeals.

Abigail Spanberger — the Democrat facing Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s governor race — Obama told the crowd in Norfolk that after the first nine months of Trump’s second term, “the stakes are now clear.”\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don’t need to wonder about whether vulnerable people are going to be hurt, or ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. We’ve witnessed it. Elections do matter,” he said. “We all have more power than we think. We just have to use it.”\n \n\n   \n  With the Democratic Party out of power in Washington and without a clear national leader, Obama is reprising his role as the party’s biggest and most unifying draw, delivering a closing message in the final days of elections that will serve as a temperature check on Trump’s first year and set the stage for next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey later Saturday, Obama told voters the state should “point America in a better direction” by electing Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat who is taking on GOP former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli in the governor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  He mocked Ciattarelli for saying in a debate that Trump deserves an “A” grade for his performance in office.\n \n\n   \n  “I know there’s been grade inflation, but really? An A? This is the best we could do? I mean, these are the same folks who put secret war plans in a group chat,” referring to the  Signal scandal . “You don’t think there’s anything they could be doing better?”\n \n\n   \n  Before heading out to the rallies on Saturday, Obama called Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City. He has not endorsed Mamdani — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the former president was sharply critical of Trump — though he only once used his name.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us are being tested right now,” Obama said. “Trump and the Republicans — they want you to think it’s part of their story, that things only happen from the top down; that a few people in power make decisions and the rest of us have to live with the consequences. But real change has always come from the bottom up; from ordinary folks who look around and say, we can do better, and then join together to make change happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Obama said he knew what Trump planned to do, but added that he “will admit, it’s worse than even I expected.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he worries about “how quickly basic democratic rules and norms have been weakened.” Obama also said he is concerned about “the growing concentration of economic power in this country,” and that business leaders, law firms and universities “have been willing to bend the knee to this president’s autocratic impulses” to avoid confrontation.\n \n\n   \n  He also criticized Trump’s replacement of career prosecutors with loyalists at the Justice Department, his “shambolic tariff policy” and said the White House every day delivers “lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like every day is Halloween, except it’s all tricks and no treats,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Nine years after leaving office, Obama remains the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate — a reality underscored by his high-profile appearances on the final weekend of two of 2025’s most important contests. Obama has also  stepped up his warnings  about what he says is the damage being wrought to the country by President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The crowd in Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday waited about five hours for Obama to speak, but that didn’t damper their enthusiasm. When Spanberger introduced Obama, the cheers for him were so loud you couldn’t hear her. The 7,000-seat arena was near capacity.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger sought to tie Tuesday’s election to a signal Democrats can send to the nation.\n \n\n   \n  “With the political turmoil coming out of Washington right now, this election is an opportunity, because in just three more days, when the polls close, Virginia voters can and will send a message. Amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington, Virginia can and will flip statewide seats from red to blue,” Spanberger said.\n \n\n   \n  The event served as an important base motivator on the last day of early voting.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m concerned about the deterioration of the country, the way people are treated. The sadness of everything that’s happening, it’s heartbreaking,” Gail Buchanan of Chesterfield, Virginia told CNN at the rally.\n \n\n   \n  Also of note, Virginia’s Democratic nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones, spoke though he was not listed as a planned speaker. Jones has been under fire for  violent language  he sent about a colleague in recently surfaced text messages in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Obama is the closer after a number of ambitious Democrats have  also hit the trail  for Sherrill and Spanberger. The list of Democratic governors to campaign with Spanberger and Sherrill includes Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Maryland’s Wes Moore, Illinois’ JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  Obama has slowly ramped up his involvement in both gubernatorial elections. He cut ads for both candidates that began airing in mid-October.\n \n\n   \n  After voting in Bridgewater on Friday, Ciattarelli — whose near miss in the 2021 New Jersey governor’s race was an early indicator of the state’s rightward shift in the 2024 presidential race, when Trump closed his losing margin from 16 percentage points in 2020 to 6 points last year — downplayed any impact Obama’s appearance with Sherrill might have in the closing days of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what I refer to as the choreography of campaigns, but at the end of day, I really believe this, particularly in New Jersey, a candidate has to win the race, and that’s why I get up and down the state every day and engage with people every day, shake hands every single day.” Ciattarelli said. “I think we’ve done that a hell of a lot better than my opponent.”\n \n\n   \n  The Virginia and New Jersey governor’s races, which are held a year after presidential elections, are widely viewed as an important gauge of the nation’s political mood almost a year into a new presidency. One year into Obama’s White House tenure, Republican Bob McDonnell’s win in Virginia and Chris Christie’s win in New Jersey offered previews of the red wave that was to come in the 2010 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger and Sherrill are favored in the blue-leaning states, but wins are no lock: Four years ago, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governor race; in New Jersey, Sherrill hasn’t been able to pull away after several public polls found her with a single-digit edge over Ciattarelli.\n \n\n   \n  Both of Obama’s Saturday stops — Newark and Norfolk — are in areas with significant Black populations. Over the last several election cycles he has appeared often with Virginia Democratic candidates at base-rallying events in the Hampton Roads region.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arlette Saenz, Eva McKend, Eric Fiegel﻿, Edward-Isaac Dovere and Dalia Abdelwahab contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/snap-benefits-november-judge-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"17:38:00-04:00","title":"Will SNAP benefits be paid in November?

Here’s what we know about the judges’ rulings \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:38 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges have said the Trump administration is required to use  emergency funds  to provide at least partial  food stamp benefits  to tens of millions of Americans in November, as the federal government shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  And President Donald Trump on Friday evening said that he’s instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the much-needed assistance won’t come that quickly for many food stamp recipients. Also, it remains unclear whether they’ll receive their full benefits or a smaller amount since the US Department of Agriculture’s contingency fund doesn’t have enough money to cover the total cost.\n \n\n   \n  Several legal and procedural challenges must be overcome before the benefits can start flowing to the nearly 42 million people in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. The US Department of Agriculture halted November allocations, arguing it  doesn’t have the funds  to provide them, which prompted  a coalition of Democratic-led states  and a group of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to sue earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  It’s now unclear whether the administration will appeal the rulings. However, the Justice Department signaled during a hearing on Thursday that it would do so if US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston issued an adverse ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  A judge in Rhode Island said during proceedings Friday in a separate case over the SNAP payments that he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure at least some benefits could be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  In a written ruling released Saturday, the judge, John McConnell, wrote that the administration must make a partial payment to SNAP beneficiaries using the contingency funds by Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But he wrote the USDA should, within its discretion, find additional funds to provide full benefits to recipients. If it chooses to do this, the agency must make the full payment by the end of Monday since it is simpler to make the full payment than calculate partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could also appeal this decision.\n \n\n   \n  In his ruling, McConnell also responded directly to Trump’s comments Friday, writing, “the Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  Whatever happens in court, it will take time for SNAP recipients to get access to any assistance in November.\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of  issuing benefits for November  after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  The delay will be felt immediately. Some 3 million recipients should receive their benefits on November 1, according to an estimate by Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. The number grows to nearly 13.7 million by November 5, with remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not going out on time,” Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said of the November benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Still, providing full payments would be the fastest way to get assistance to food stamp recipients.\n \n\n   \n  “If the administration complies with the courts’ rulings to release the SNAP contingency funds immediately and supplements those amounts using its legal transfer authority, which the courts also affirmed, then SNAP benefits could begin to be issued with only a short delay,” said Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n    Partial payments harder to do\n \n\n   \n  However, the process could become much more complicated — and time consuming — if the USDA opts to only tap into its contingency fund and doesn’t augment it with leftover tariff revenue dedicated to child nutrition programs, as it did with the  WIC nutrition assistance program .\n \n\n   \n  The emergency fund only has $5.3 billion remaining in it, while benefits total about $8.2 billion for the month, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which represents the USDA in the case. (Other expenses and benefits bring the total closer to $9 billion.)\n \n\n   \n  The USDA also has access to nearly $17 billion in tariff revenue, but a Justice Department attorney told a judge Friday that using the funds for SNAP would hurt the child nutrition programs that the money supports. Both Talwani and the judge in Rhode Island, John McConnell, left it up to the USDA to decide whether to use the additional resources to pay full benefits in November.\n \n\n   \n  If only the contingency fund were tapped, the USDA would have to reduce benefits for all SNAP recipients, which it has never done, according to a declaration filed by the agency official who oversees the program. Also, state agencies would need to recode their systems to issue the smaller benefit amounts, which could result in payment errors.\n \n\n   \n  “Because no template, processes, or past experience exist to inform a reduction in benefits, there are multiple variables which could lead to significant problems in attempting to reduce benefits for every SNAP household in the country,” Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of the USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said in his declaration. “The ability, time and resources to accomplish this system change would vary greatly among State agencies, with some State agencies working with systems that are decades old.”\n \n\n   \n  For at least some states, the process could take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, Penn said, drawing upon informal conversations with state agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Before states could even act, the USDA would also have to determine how to calculate and authorize the reduced allotments. This effort could be hampered if its employees have been furloughed during the shutdown or laid off or departed amid the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government, Plata-Nino said.\n \n\n   \n  While some states have identified potential ways to issue smaller benefits quickly, the methods must be programmed, tested and verified, which could take time, she noted.\n \n\n   \n  If recipients receive partial benefits in November, they would get retroactive payments to make them whole once the government reopens, she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/nancy-mace-charleston-airport-incident","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:53:00-05:00","title":"Rep.

Nancy Mace berated Charleston airport police due to missing escort, incident report says \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:53 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina allegedly berated police officers at Charleston International Airport Thursday morning, allegedly “loudly cursing” at officers and saying they were “f**king incompetent,” according to an incident report from police.\n \n\n   \n  Mace, who  closely aligns herself  with President Donald Trump and is  currently running  for South Carolina governor, has repeatedly shared concerns about her safety in the past. Last December, she reported being  “physically accosted”  on Capitol grounds.\n \n\n   \n  One officer said in their report: “Any other person in the airport acting and talking the way she did, our department would have been dispatch (sic) and we would have addressed the behavior.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Mace’s office for comment. Mace’s Director of Operations Cameron Morabito told CNN in a statement, “Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you’re leading the race for governor.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are forced to take the congresswoman’s safety extremely seriously,” Morabito said. “After the world watched Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the threats against her have only intensified. Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicize this reality is both dangerous and reckless.”\n \n\n   \n  Mace also briefly spoke with the Times, saying she did complain to the airport because she is concerned about her safety given recent death threats against her. “We all get frustrated when it’s not taken seriously,” she told the outlet.\n \n\n   \n    Mace ran late, arrived in different vehicle\n \n\n   \n  Two Charleston County Aviation Authority police officers were informed at 6 a.m. they would need to escort Mace from the curb to her flight, according to an incident report filed by the officers. They were told she would arrive at 6:30 a.m. in a white BMW, the report says.\n \n\n   \n  At 6:20 a.m., three officers went to the ticketing curb area and waited for her car, the report said. They were informed at around 6:35 a.m. she was running 15 minutes late and kept waiting for the car, they said, not seeing a white BMW.\n \n\n   \n  Security video provided to CNN by the airport shows Mace arriving at a sidewalk entrance area at 6:50 a.m. in a dark gray sedan. No other people were visible in the video. Airport officials said they had no further comment.\n \n\n   \n  A little before 7 a.m., officers were told Mace was waiting at the Transportation Security Administration known crewmember entrance, and the officers made their way over “in less than a minute,” the report said.\n \n\n   \n  When officers met Mace to escort her, they said she was “very irate” and “began loudly cursing and making derogatory comments to us and about the department.”\n \n\n   \n  “She repeatedly stated we were ‘f**king incompetent,’ and ‘this is no way to treat a f**king US Representative’,” one officer said in his report. “She also said we would never treat (US Sen.) Tim Scott like this.”\n \n\n   \n  A different security video provided to CNN by the airport shows the TSA security checkpoint with Mace speaking with two airport officials at the known crewmember entrance. It appears an airport employee made a call to an unknown person, and approximately three minutes later the two officers arrived to escort Mace. It took about seven minutes from the time Mace appears at the known crewmember entrance and starts interacting with airport employees to when the escorting officers arrive, according to the video.\n \n\n   \n  Mace allegedly continued cursing at the officers and into her phone while they walked with her to the gate, according to the account of one officer. After she boarded her flight, an airline employee and several other TSA agents said they were shocked and upset by her behavior, the officer said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/trump-white-house-press-limits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:34:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration restricts reporters’ access to White House press secretary’s office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, the Trump administration restricted journalists from accessing the White House press secretary’s office, known as the 'Upper Press,' without an appointment, citing security concerns.

Trump administration restricts reporters’ access to White House press secretary’s office \n       \n  By Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:34 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Members of the White House press corps are now restricted from the press secretary’s office, the latest in a series of Trump administration actions to limit media access.\n \n\n   \n  The new rule says journalists cannot access what’s known as the “Upper Press” office space, where White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt works, “without an appointment.”\n \n\n   \n  This area has been accessible to White House correspondents for decades, supporting a free flow of information between the president and the public.\n \n\n   \n  The White House says the clampdown is due to security concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “This policy will ensure adherence to best practices pertaining to access to sensitive material,” a White House memo asserted on Friday night.\n \n\n   \n  In response, the White House Correspondents’ Association, which represents hundreds of credentialed reporters, said it “unequivocally opposes any effort” to limit journalists from areas that have long been accessible for newsgathering, “including the press secretary’s office.”\n \n\n   \n  “The new restrictions hinder the press corps’ ability to question officials, ensure transparency, and hold the government accountable, to the detriment of the American public,” the association said.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN’s Jeff Zeleny explained, reporters routinely “wait in the hall” by the press secretary’s office and seek information from communications aides. “When there is breaking news, that often happens,” Zeleny said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, “reporters will only have access to a smaller set of offices of junior advisers, junior aides, junior press secretaries,” according to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  White House communications director Steven Cheung’s office is also deemed off-limits due to the change.\n \n\n   \n  Cheung, who regularly expresses hostility toward reporters on social media platform X, asserted in a Friday night post that, “some reporters have been caught” taking pictures of sensitive information and “eavesdropping on private, closed-door meetings.”\n \n\n   \n  That claim came as news to White House press corps leaders, who are not aware of colleagues being “caught.”\n \n\n   \n  Early in Bill Clinton’s presidency, Clinton aides similarly attempted to bar journalists from the “upper press” area, causing an outcry. That ban was rescinded.\n \n\n   \n  Journalists had normal access to the offices during President Trump’s first term in office. But in his second term, Trump and his aides have taken several steps to stymie news coverage and circumvent traditional media outlets.\n \n\n   \n  Last winter, the administration blocked the Associated Press   from attending some White House events, leading to a First Amendment lawsuit that is still working its way through the courts.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has also stopped publishing transcripts of Trump’s remarks; has taken control of daily press pool assignments; and has invited fawning pro-Trump commentators to presidential Q&As.\n \n\n   \n  Some cabinet secretaries have followed Trump’s lead. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth implemented severe new restrictions for Pentagon press pass credentialing, leading virtually every major media outlet to reject the rules and give up access to the Pentagon complex.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/nypd-nyc-mayoral-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:22:00-20:22","title":"Hotly contested mayoral election isn’t just about the candidates.

election isn’t just about the candidates. The NYPD’s future is also at stake \n       \n  By Mark Morales, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:22 PM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With the  high-stakes New York mayoral contest  hanging in the balance, the largest police department in the country may find itself caught between the promise of reform and the stability that followed a couple of scandal-scarred years.\n \n\n   \n  If  Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani  wins the election, his choice to lead the NYPD through a period of political transition is already in the job: current Commissioner Jessica Tisch.\n \n\n   \n  While Tisch has managed to earn praise from representatives from both political parties as well as business leaders, her stance on various key issues, from the use of the NYPD’s gang database to the deployment of a specialized unit that responds to protests and major events, stands in opposition to what Mamdani has promised during the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Despite their stark differences in policing strategies, Mamdani has said each hire he makes for his new administration would be in lock step with his vision for the future. Tisch has declined to publicly address the prospect of staying on as police commissioner, but Mamdani has said he is confident she would accept the position, leaving former police officials and advocates to wonder how both would coexist.\n \n\n   \n  While the New York City police commissioner technically answers to and is appointed by the mayor, a savvy police executive can always carve out some autonomy despite an administration’s reform promises.\n \n\n   \n  “She has leverage over him at the moment, and leverage in the sense of negotiating,” former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said of Tisch, a former sanitation department commissioner. “I think she would be willing to stay if some of her conditions, whatever they may be, be met.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani officially announced his intention to keep Tisch as commissioner from a debate stage on October 22.\n \n\n   \n  “I make the decision to retain Commissioner Tisch not only to build on the results that we’ve seen under her tenure, but also to deliver on the agenda that I’ve been running on,” Mamdani told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Tisch said she was staying out of the fray.\n \n\n   \n  “As I’ve said many times, it is not appropriate for the Police Commissioner to be directly involved or to seem to be involved in electoral politics,” Tisch said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    Flashback to over a decade ago\n \n\n   \n  Public safety has been a major issue in the hotly contested mayor’s race that pits Democratic socialist Mamdani against former New York Gov. and  independent candidate Andrew Cuomo  and the  Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa . Cuomo and Sliwa each have said they would keep Tisch as police commissioner.\n \n\n   \n  Judging by the early voting numbers,  New Yorkers are already flocking to the polls .\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the course of the campaign,  Mamdani has moderated some of his most controversial stances  on policing, distancing himself from a previous call to defund the police and apologizing for calling police officers “racist” and “wicked.”\n \n\n   \n  Bratton, an experienced police executive who ran the NYPD twice, was in a similar position in which Tisch may find herself when he came back for the second time during the start of Bill de Blasio’s administration in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  While de Blasio was known as a progressive who rankled many of the rank-and-file, Bratton said they shared the same vision when it came to incorporating neighborhood policing, de-escalation training, more police officers on the street and a robust budget to operate the department, Bratton said.\n \n\n   \n  As a condition of accepting the appointment, Bratton said, he made sure he could pick his team and had the freedom to make decisions without interference.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Tisch appear to be further apart philosophically than he was from de Blasio, according to Bratton.\n \n\n   \n  “The worst thing that can happen for (Mamdani) is, if (Tisch) were to step away, a successor comes in, crime goes up and disorder goes up. And the potential for that is very, very significant,” Bratton said.\n \n\n   \n   Bratton’s retirement as police commissioner in September 2016  came at a time of record declines in crime but heightened distrust of police by minority communities, after the death of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of police on Staten Island in 2014, sparked protests.\n \n\n   \n    Conflicting philosophies emerge\n \n\n   \n  Tisch took over as police commissioner in November of last year, just a week before prosecutors allege Luigi Mangione gunned down the UnitedHealthcare CEO in midtown Manhattan. Since then, Tisch has made her mark on the department, replacing many loyalists of former Mayor Eric Adams who were in positions of power, shuffling others around, and accepting the resignation of  former Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey  after he was embroiled in an overtime-for-sexual-favors scandal.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also touted the importance of the controversial NYPD gang database used to track gang members, attacked the “Raise the Age” law, which increased the age of criminal prosecution from 16 to 18, and gone after bail reform laws – all positions that are at odds with Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  The candidate has also spoken out about disbanding the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group – an elite unit that specializes in responding to major events, whether they be protests or even the midtown mass shooting at 345 Park Ave. Mamdani also wants the final disciplinary decision on officers to go from the police commissioner to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the city agency charged with oversight of the NYPD – though that would need a change to the law. Both are ideas that routinely spark sharp criticism from law enforcement circles.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the seeming differences, if Tisch were to stay, it would provide stability for officers not only out on the street, but for high-ranking officials who would otherwise be walking on eggshells inside police headquarters as they wait for a new administration to take over.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it calms a lot of the cops who may have been nervous. That there’s not going to be this big, dramatic change overnight,” said  former NYPD Chief of Department Kenneth Corey,  who was the highest-ranked uniformed member of the department on Adams’ first day as mayor in 2022. “Whether they like (Tisch) or not, she’s the devil they know and it also helps calm the business community, who are also very worried about the prospect of what crime would look like under a Mamdani administration.”\n \n\n   \n    Mental health response would be focus\n \n\n   \n  While there may not be wholesale changes to the NYPD if Tisch stays as police commissioner, there would be new initiatives under Mamdani, such as a new civilian agency called the Department of Community Safety. The agency would focus on a community-based prevention approach targeting homelessness and people experiencing mental illness.\n \n\n   \n  Its hallmark won’t be adding more police but rather adding more mental health professionals and violence interrupters – a plan Mamdani says he hopes would free up officers to respond to other crimes.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023, the NYPD responded to under 180,000 calls that involved an emotionally disturbed person, out of roughly 9 million 911 calls, according to statistics unveiled at a city hall hearing in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Corey said he tried to get a similar plan off the ground but had trouble with appropriate staffing.\n \n\n   \n  “The city is not the greatest employer when it comes to pay. You’re going to hire clinicians and social workers and people with advanced degrees. You’re not going to pay them a whole lot of money,” Corey said. “Then you’re going to tell them, ‘Oh, by the way, you know you’re working Christmas morning, or you’re working the midnight shift every weekend.’ These are the challenges we ran into when we’ve tried to do that before, even as a co-response model. There are just not enough of these clinicians and mental health professionals who are willing to go out into the street and do this kind of work in the hours that it needs to be done.”\n \n\n   \n   Richard Aborn , president of the nonprofit   Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, supports mental health professionals being involved but wonders about safety.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it makes a lot of sense to have mental health teams go on calls when there’s an emotionally disturbed person, but having a mental health team go exclusively could be dangerous,” Aborn said. “The question is, how are you going to assess that? A call comes into 911, there’s a person locked up in the bedroom screaming, ‘I’m going to kill you.’ Who’s going to assess whether it’s just a mental health team or if police officers go along?”\n \n\n   \n  Corey recalled a scenario when a woman called 911 asking for help for her son, telling dispatchers they were nonviolent.\n \n\n   \n  “If you heard her, she almost sounded like she was sleeping,” Corey said about the woman’s 911 call. “And she’s just ‘no, he’s not violent. He just needs to go. Somebody just needs to take him to the hospital so he can get his medicine,’ and 11 seconds after the police officers were in the apartment, there was a cop flat on his back. This guy was straddled, with a butcher knife, over him, and (NYPD) shot him.” The man was killed in the shooting, according to Corey.\n \n\n   \n    The specter of the National Guard\n \n\n   \n  Looming in the distance as well is the threat of potential federal intervention into crime-fighting in New York City, should Mamdani win the election.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has spoken out about President Donald Trump sending National Guard troops into Democrat-run major cities, a move the president says is to restore law and order. Mamdani previously told CNN he would respond to the attempt by filing a lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  “What we would do in running this city, is first, to actually take this administration to court and to do so immediately as opposed to being pressured to do it,” Mamdani said, adding he would follow in the footsteps of other leaders like  Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. \n \n\n   \n  Bratton is among those current and former law enforcement leaders who say the sheer size and scope of the NYPD, in addition to low crime numbers, are strong indicators New York City doesn’t need the National Guard – who are already deployed but work in a different capacity  –  to patrol the streets in that way.\n \n\n   \n  It may not even come to that, Bratton said, if Tisch, a billionaire heiress from one of New York City’s most prominent families, remains at the helm.\n \n\n   \n  “Jesse and her family have very good relations with a number of the Trump side of the house,” Bratton said. “Jesse also brings a form of stability against the tide that we know is going to put pressure up against New York, and she has the ability, I think, to dissipate some of what’s going on in Los Angeles and Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  Tisch took over for interim police commissioner Tom Donlon, who has since gone on to  file a lawsuit alleging corruption  at the highest levels of the NYPD. She became the fourth police commissioner appointed during the Adams administration – a constant change that became emblematic of the instability and air of corruption   at the department.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the department is struggling with staffing issues as members continue to either retire or get poached by other police departments in other cities. There are currently less than 35,000 members with the NYPD, a figure that’s less than highs in 2000 and 2019, according to statistics provided by the Police Benevolent Association.\n \n\n   \n  So far this year, roughly 300 officers have left the department each month, according to the union’s statistics.   NYPD recruit classes continue to lag behind the number of recruits in previous classes, according to a union official.\n \n\n   \n  As staffing is a constant issue, Mayor Eric Adams announced a plan to potentially add 5,000 new police officers to the department by 2029, a move that would boost the department’s headcount to the largest it’s been in the last 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  While the move opens the door to adding more officers, it still leaves the issue of actually finding enough recruits to fill the hiring surge. In April, city officials changed the eligibility standard for recruits, eliminating the need for college credit. The move bolstered applications, with 4,000 ineligible applicants – who did not meet the requirements – reopening their cases, according to city officials.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, who credited Tisch with rooting out corruption, believes she has shown during a turbulent period that she’s committed to the department.\n \n\n   \n  The high turnover among top police executives, is something Corey says rank and file officers – who may find themselves having to execute  progressive strategies they may not agree with – have noticed.\n \n\n   \n  “What the cops have learned at the bottom is that, ‘If I don’t like your idea, I don’t actually have to do it,’” Corey said. “‘I just need to slow walk it, because you’re going to be gone soon, and so will your idea.’”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/fbi-fires-agent-trump-investigations","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"13:52:00-04:00","title":"FBI Forces Out Special Agent Who Helped Oversee Trump Investigation, Sources Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI has reportedly forced out Aaron Tapp, a senior special agent with over 20 years of experience who previously oversaw investigations into Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including the Arctic Frost probe into fake electors.

FBI has forced out a special agent who previously helped oversee public corruption cases, including an investigation that became part of former special counsel Jack Smith’s probe into President Donald Trump, according to two sources familiar with the matter — another apparent casualty of the Trump administration’s retribution push.\n \n\n   \n  Aaron Tapp, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Antonio office, was previously the deputy assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters.\n \n\n   \n  Tapp will be retiring from the bureau later this month, a third person briefed on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For a time he had oversight of probes into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. One of these investigations — known as Arctic Frost — focused on the fake electors scheme, in which Trump allies sought to have Trump electors counted as electoral college votes from states that Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Republicans have released FBI records showing details of the Arctic Frost investigation and accused Smith and FBI leaders of political motives in using grand jury subpoenas to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers. The records, obtained in 2023, covered four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot . The FBI didn’t obtain the contents of the calls. Smith has denied any political motives and said the subpoenas were routine investigative tools.\n \n\n   \n  Tapp has been with the FBI for more than 20 years, according to his bio on the FBI’s website.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the FBI’s headquarters and San Antonio field office for comment.\n \n\n   \n   Three former senior FBI officials summarily fired  in August are suing FBI Director Kash Patel and the Trump administration, alleging that their terminations were part of a White House-directed purge driven at least in part by social media bullying from MAGA loyalists, CNN reported last month.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Driscoll, the former acting FBI director for a month at the start of the second Trump administration; Steven Jensen, who Patel installed as assistant director in charge the Washington field office; and Spencer Evans, who led the Las Vegas field office, allege that Patel has politicized the FBI to protect his own job.\n \n\n   \n  “Patel not only acted unlawfully but deliberately chose to prioritize politicizing the FBI over protecting the American people,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  The 68-page complaint provided first-hand accounts from top FBI officials of the tumultuous first few weeks of Trump’s second term. Driscoll and other senior officials resisted efforts to try to fire or otherwise punish all FBI agents or employees for simply having worked on criminal investigations of Trump, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Patel and other officials, during Senate confirmation hearings, had dismissed any plans for political retribution, despite Trump’s repeated threats during his campaign rallies to do exactly that.\n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Aaron Tapp had been fired.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:12 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fighting for control of the strategic hub of Pokrovsk in eastern  Ukraine  is intensifying, with the Russian Defense Ministry claiming to have eliminated a group of Ukrainian special forces sent to help defend the area.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks,  Russian  units have begun penetrating Pokrovsk itself and have closed in on the last resupply routes used to sustain Ukrainian forces in the town.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian special forces had landed in a helicopter on the northwestern outskirts of Pokrovsk, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Drone footage shared by an unofficial Russian Telegram channel showed Ukrainian soldiers fanning out from a Blackhawk helicopter. Eleven of the troops that had landed were killed, the Defense ministry claimed. It’s unclear when the mission took place.\n \n\n   \n  A source in Ukrainian intelligence told CNN that the claim was untrue. Stabilization efforts led by the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov continue in Pokrovsk, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian 7th Aerial Assault Corps also said there had been a successful landing in the Pokrovsk area. “It was a complex operation that required the synchronized actions of various units,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian units have managed to improve their tactical position in several districts of the city, according to the Corps. “We are increasing the number of assault groups in Pokrovsk,” it said, adding that 85 Russian soldiers had been killed in Pokrovsk over the past week.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian military’s commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that Pokrovsk and the neighboring town of Myrnohrad were “not surrounded or blocked, and we are doing everything we can to maintain logistics.”\n \n\n   \n  “A comprehensive operation to destroy and dislodge enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing,” Syrskyi said, adding that he had visited the area to coordinate its defense.\n \n\n   \n  Enemy units continued “to attempt to infiltrate residential areas and cut off our supply routes,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that its units “continue to destroy surrounded Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the area of the railway station” in Pokrovsk, and had repelled several attempts by Ukrainian forces to break out of the town. It added that the encirclement of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad was tightening.\n \n\n   \n  President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that about 200 Russian troops had infiltrated Pokrovsk. Geolocated video has shown Russian soldiers in the southern part of the town, moving in small groups.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian forces have tried to counter-attack, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, and had marginally advanced north of the town.\n \n\n   \n  Were Pokrovsk to fall, it would be the largest urban area to be taken by Russian forces since they seized Bakhmut in May 2023. The town is a junction for road and railway lines and occupying it would bring Russian forces closer to the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in the industrial belt of Donetsk.\n \n\n   \n  According to the unofficial Ukrainian DeepState website, which analyzes the battlefield, Russian forces gained 267 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in October — the same as in September.\n \n\n   \n  Efforts by the US President Donald Trump to get a ceasefire agreed in Ukraine have come to nothing, with the Kremlin insisting that the root causes of the conflict - including NATO’s expansion eastwards and what it has called the “Nazification” of Ukraine - must be addressed before there can be a truce.\n \n\n   \n  Moscow has said that the original goals of what it calls its Special Military Operation are non-negotiable: sovereignty over four eastern regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk.\n \n\n   \n    Pipelines blown up\n \n\n   \n  As Russian forces edge forward along several parts of the frontline, Ukraine have continued their long-range efforts to destroy and disrupt Russia’s energy and military infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Ukrainian saboteurs blew up up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to the country’s defense officials – the latest attack in a campaign by Kyiv to target refineries, pumping stations and pipelines.\n \n\n   \n  “The ‘Koltsevoy’ oil pipeline, which supplied the Russian occupation army,” was disabled on Friday in a special operation, according to a statement from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI).\n \n\n   \n  It published an image showing what appeared to be devices placed on three separate pipelines near Ramenskoye, south of Moscow, which were under anti-drone netting. Video published by DI showed an explosion that sent flames hundreds of meters into the air.\n \n\n   \n  “All three lines used by the aggressor to transport gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel were successfully and simultaneously blown up,” DI said.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many recent attacks using drones and missiles, the Ukrainians used a sabotage team to lay explosive devices at the site, according to the DI video.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been no word from the Russian authorities on the explosion nor on any disruption to fuel supplies. But the local authorities in the nearby district of Zhukovsky reported power cuts for some consumers on Friday without specifying the cause.\n \n\n   \n  The pipeline that forms a ring around Moscow is fed from several refineries. It is capable of pumping up to 3 million tons of aviation fuel, up to 2.8 million tons of diesel fuel, and up to 1.6 million tons of gasoline annually, according to DI.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine began  targeting  Russian energy infrastructure on a persistent basis in the summer, using longer-range drones and missiles to attack facilities deep inside Russian territory.\n \n\n   \n  “Our strikes have had more impact than the sanctions [against Russia]” said Budanov. “We have caused much greater damage to the Russian Federation through direct action than any economic levers of influence that have been introduced so far.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s President Zelensky said earlier this month that as much as  20%  of Russian refining capacity had been taken out of action, and several Russian regions have reported petrol shortages.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has imported more fuel from Belarus to compensate for the shortages.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/berkshire-hathaway-profits-buffett","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00-04:00","title":"Berkshire Profit Rises, Cash Soars to Record","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Berkshire Hathaway reported a 34% rise in operating profit and a 17% increase in net income due to stock investment gains, despite maintaining a record $381.7 billion in cash and selling more stocks than buying for 12 consecutive quarters.

November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Early voting data suggests that  Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia  are heading into the final weekend in a slightly stronger position than Kamala Harris was at the same time last year.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City,  Andrew Cuomo  may be in a stronger position than in the primary, but there are signs of increased activity from younger voters, a key part of  Zohran Mamdani’s base .\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s experts analyzed the pre-election voting data in all three locations, comparing to 2024 in New Jersey and Virginia to better reflect the changes in early voting patterns over the last four years.\n \n\n   \n  Although early voting analysis can provide hints about which candidates may be well positioned heading into November 4, it is impossible to know who pre-election voters supported or how candidates will do on Election Day, when many of the ballots will be cast.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey: A Democratic turnout advantage\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Democrats have turned out at a higher rate than Republican voters in both mail and early in-person voting, putting the Democratic candidate for governor, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in a stronger position than Harris was last year at this point. Harris eventually won the state by about 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  Through the end of Thursday, registered Democrats led registered Republicans in mail ballot returns by over 41 points, a couple of points better than the 39-point gap at this point last year. But unlike last year, Democrats also hold a nearly 2-point lead in in-person early voting. Last year at this time, Democrats trailed in in-person voting by 2 points.\n \n\n   \n  Mail ballots also represent a larger portion of the pre-election vote so far. As a result, registered Democrats represent a larger share of the total pre-election electorate than they did at this point last year.\n \n\n   \n    New York City: Older voters have turned out more; younger voters are catching up\n \n\n   \n  Among registered Democrats, a group that will make up the lion’s share of New York City mayoral voters, older voters have turned out more so far than they did during the primary, when strong backing from younger voters helped propel Mamdani to a surprise victory. But the electorate is still younger than in past mayoral elections and has only been getting younger as the week has gone on.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis of early voting data from the New York City Board of Elections has found that through October 31, about 53% of registered Democratic voters (55% of all voters so far) are ages 50 and up, while almost 16% of Democratic voters are ages 18 to 29 (15% of voters overall).\n \n\n   \n  That’s more weighted towards older voters than the total Democratic   primary electorate, when about 48% were 50 or older and about 18% of voters were 18-29, according to data from L2.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown that younger voters overwhelmingly favor Mamdani, while Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has a smaller lead among older voters.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s turnout is still younger than the city’s last mayoral election in 2021, when just 9% of voters were ages 18 to 29 and 62% were ages 50 and older.\n \n\n   \n  Over the course of the week, daily turnout among Democrats has gotten younger: while older voters outnumbered younger ones by about 50 percentage points on the first day of early voting, that dropped below 20 points on the seventh day.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of Democratic votes has also been more favorable to Cuomo than it was in the June primary, with turnout strongest so far in precincts where Cuomo did best and relatively weaker in strong Mamdani areas. The most Cuomo-friendly precincts have cast 125% of their primary early in-person totals while the most Mamdani-friendly precincts have cast 85% of their early voting totals.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if the precinct-level Mamdani vs. Cuomo vote from the primary stayed the same, the changes so far in geographic distribution alone wouldn’t be nearly enough for Cuomo to overtake Mamdani among Democratic early voters.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia: Spanberger appears in slightly stronger position\n \n\n   \n  While voters don’t register by party in Virginia, the geographic breakdown of votes cast so far suggests Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is in slightly stronger position heading into the final stretch than Harris was at the same point in last year’s election, when she won Virginia by less than 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of early in-person votes has slightly favored Republicans, while the distribution of mail ballots is similar to what it was at this point last year. But mail ballots, in which Democrats typically perform better, make up a larger share of the pre-election vote this year (24%) than they did at this point last year (21%), resulting in a geographic breakdown of the combined pre-election vote that is more Democratic-leaning relative to the same point in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  Through Thursday, counties where Trump won last year are averaging 61% of their in-person votes cast at the equivalent point last year, while Harris-won counties are at just over 57%.

(See the recent controversy over  AI actress Tilly Norwood. ) But as loud as the concerns might be, AI continues to grow in the arts.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 146,000 followers on  Instagram alone , Monet is proof that consumers are increasingly open to the idea, even if the industry is riled by it.\n \n\n   \n  Monet’s Apple Music artist profile explains that Monet is “an Al figure presented as a contemporary R&B vocalist in the highly expressive, church-bred, down-to-earth vein of Keyshia Cole, K. Michelle, and Muni Long.”\n \n\n   \n  Monet was designed by Telisha Nikki Jones, a poet from Mississippi who writes the lyrics Monet is seen performing with help from Suno, “a generative artificial intelligence music creation program,” the bio explains.\n \n\n   \n  Monet released a full-length album “Unfolded” in August, which had 24 songs. A seven-track EP, “Pieces Left Behind,” followed in September.\n \n\n   \n  A press release from Monet’s representative touted the AI singer’s “smooth, soulful sound” and “human-like delivery.” But Romel Murphy, who says he’s Monet’s manager and spoke with  CNN’s Victor Blackwell,  insisted that there is no intent to replace human singers and songwriters.\n \n\n   \n  “AI doesn’t replace the artist. That’s not our goal at all. It doesn’t diminish the creativity and doesn’t take away from the human experience,” he said. “It’s a new frontier and like anything would change some people are receptive and some people are apprehensive.”\n \n\n   \n  Billboard recently reported that “in just the past few months, at least six AI or AI-assisted artists have debuted on various Billboard rankings.”\n \n\n   \n  “That figure could be higher, as it’s become increasingly difficult to tell who or what is powered by AI — and to what extent,” according to the publication. “Many of these charting projects, whose music spans every genre from gospel to rock to country, also arrive with anonymous or mysterious origins.”\n \n\n   \n  Murphy doesn’t appear to see an issue and likens it all to the music of Michael Jackson and Prince, who died in 2009 and 2016 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  “They both have music catalogs that are expanding decades to this day. Youth are still listening to those songs and they’re no longer with us and they’re connected to their music,” Murphy said. “So it is the music because they don’t have the history of the contact or the concert live field, but they still love those songs. Music has to evolve as well.”\n \n\n   \n  “We just have to keep the integrity and be intentional about the realness of it and push the music to the world,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Monet’s representative for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, working musicians are – as expected– troubled.\n \n\n   \n  “There is an AI R&B artist who just signed a multimillion-dollar deal … and the person is doing none of the work,” Kehlani  said  of Monet in a now-deleted video posted to TikTok. “This is so beyond out of our control.”\n \n\n   \n  The human singer added: “Nothing and no one on Earth will ever be able to justify AI to me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/science/nasa-moon-lunar-lander-options","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:32:00-04:00","title":"Inside NASA’s scramble to find a backup moon plan — and the wild ideas companies are pitching","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NASA is scrambling to find a viable backup plan for its Artemis III moon landing mission, driven by delays in SpaceX’s Starship development and growing competition from China.

However, citing delays in Starship’s development and competitive pressure from China, NASA asked SpaceX and Blue Origin — which holds a separate lunar lander contract with the space agency — to submit plans to expedite development of their respective spacecraft by October 29.  Both companies have responded.\n \n\n   \n  But the space agency is also asking the broader commercial space industry to detail how they might get the job done more quickly, hinting that NASA leadership is prepared to sideline its current partners.\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke with half a dozen companies about how they plan to respond to NASA’s call to action, which the agency will formally issue once the government shutdown ends, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  While some of the potential proposals appear more straightforward than the current moon-landing plan that uses Starship, each involves constructing and testing new spacecraft designs, a process that typically takes at least six or seven years, noted Casey Drier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society.\n \n\n   \n  This could pose an issue for NASA’s timeline. China aims to land its astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030, and Duffy has repeatedly indicated he views beating China as a national security imperative.\n \n\n   \n  Artemis III is currently slated to happen as early as mid-2027, and NASA has signaled that the current pace of Starship development is threatening to push that target months or years into the future.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a certain part of the moon that everyone knows is the best,” Duffy said, referring to the moon’s largely unexplored south pole region — the target landing site for NASA’s Artemis III astronauts.\n \n\n   \n  “We have ice there. We have sunlight there. We want to get there first and claim that for America,” he said in  August .\n \n\n   \n  Experts who spoke with CNN for this article said that reevaluating SpaceX’s lunar lander contract could be wise. Spending years to develop an entirely new spacecraft could still potentially be faster, some argued, than waiting for Starship, which presents extremely difficult engineering challenges due to its sheer size and unprecedented design.\n \n\n   \n  Still, SpaceX has ticked a few boxes that might give it a significant leg up on the competition. Though in light of NASA’s broader lunar ambitions, experts say the real contest is about much more than speed.\n \n\n   \n    More power, more problems\n \n\n   \n  Touted as the most powerful rocket system ever built, Starship has launched on 11 eye-popping suborbital test flights, relighting engines in space, reusing boosters and demonstrating the ability to deploy satellites along the way.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted to its website on Thursday, SpaceX also said it has “completed 49 milestones tied to developing the subsystems, infrastructure, and operations needed to land astronauts on the Moon.” And the “vast majority” of its contractual testing milestones for NASA have happened on schedule, according to the company.\n \n\n   \n  NASA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on SpaceX’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  Starship has also faced significant setbacks — particularly this year. In the first six months of 2025, three prototype vehicles exploded during test flights and another burst into flames during routine ground testing, causing damage to SpaceX’s surrounding infrastructure in Texas. The hangups prompted national security hawks to voice worries that SpaceX won’t deliver Starship in time to realize NASA’s goals.\n \n\n   \n  Under the current plan, NASA would launch its astronauts aboard the Orion capsule atop the Space Launch System rocket, both of which NASA developed. After reaching lunar orbit, the astronauts would transfer to Starship, which would ferry two people down to the moon’s surface and then back to lunar orbit.\n \n\n   \n  But Starship is likely still a long way from being capable of carrying out such an endeavor.  So far, the company has only attempted to fly Starship on hour-long, suborbital test flights. It has not yet sent a vehicle to orbit on an operational mission, nor has it attempted to top off Starship’s fuel during a flight — a step that will be necessary for lunar missions because of Starship’s massive size and design.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear how many refueling flights would need to be launched prior to Starship carrying out Artemis III. As CNN previously reported, the number could be  anywhere from 10 to 40 . And transferring cryogenic propellants, of the kind Starship relies on, has never been attempted before with any spacecraft.\n \n\n   \n  “SpaceX is not going to be able to make this work before 2030,” said Doug Loverro, a former chief of human spaceflight at NASA, expressing a sentiment recently  echoed  by two prior NASA administrators.\n \n\n   \n  The company did not provide details about its plan to expedite work on the NASA contract. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment from CNN, nor does the company typically answer questions from reporters.\n \n\n   \n    Retrofitting Blue Moon\n \n\n   \n  One alternative option that Duffy mentioned during a TV blitz last week is using a spacecraft built by Blue Origin. The Jeff Bezos-funded company already has a contract to provide lunar landers for use later in the Artemis program, including the Artemis V mission.\n \n\n   \n  And because Blue Origin already has an Artemis contract, it could be simpler for NASA to switch up the order in which it relies on its contractors rather than bringing a new company into the mix.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, Blue Origin is developing two models of its Blue Moon landers: Mark 1 for cargo, and Mark 2, the vehicle designed for humans and intended for use during Artemis V.\n \n\n   \n  But to expedite the creation of a lunar lander that could be used for the Artemis III mission, Blue Origin plans to propose a new design that leverages elements of both Mark 1 and Mark 2, according to an industry source familiar with the plan that hasn’t been made public.\n \n\n   \n  Then, to get the vehicle to the moon, Blue Origin would make use of one or more Mark 1 landers that have been essentially converted into small rocket stages that could boost a scaled-down version of Mark 2 out of Earth orbit and to its destination.\n \n\n   \n  The approach would require multiple launches, but likely fewer than the current plan with Starship, the source noted. Blue Origin’s plan also does not require the launch of refueling tankers or transferring super-chilled propellants between spacecraft in orbit.\n \n\n   \n    A team effort\n \n\n   \n  Lockheed Martin — which previously worked on Blue Origin’s lander design but is not actively part of a partnership — also intends to throw its hat in the ring.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, as a legacy NASA contractor, the company built the  $20.4 billion Orion spacecraft  that astronauts will ride when they take off from Earth.   Orion has already flown one successful mission around the moon — Artemis I — and is slated for a crewed test flight to lunar orbit as soon as February.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Lockheed says it can piece together a two-stage lunar lander that uses spare parts harvested from Orion.\n \n\n   \n  The company would make use of Space Shuttle-era OMS-E engines — which are also  used on Orion  — to serve as the propulsion for an “ascent stage” of the lunar lander, providing the thrust for the vehicle to lift off the moon after a mission is completed.\n \n\n   \n  But the vehicle also needs a descent stage to get down to the lunar surface in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  For that component, Lockheed plans to work with another commercial space outfit, though it has not yet decided which one, said Rob Chambers, Lockheed’s director of human spaceflight strategy, and Tim Cichan, the company’s chief architect of space exploration, during a video call last week.\n \n\n   \n  There are two paths Lockheed could take   for its descent stage that could determine which company it teams up with.   It could use a cryogenically fueled lunar lander similar to Blue Origin’s Mark 1. Or it could go with a vehicle that uses more stable propellants such as hypergolic fuels.\n \n\n   \n  If Lockheed decides to go with cryogenic fuels, which must be kept at super-cold temperatures, it would need to launch its ascent stage and descent stage on separate rockets and dock them in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  In that scenario, it may also need to launch additional “boost stages” to kick them out to the moon, Cichan said.\n \n\n   \n  If Lockheed opts for a descent stage with more stable fuels, however, the whole lander could launch in one piece. But it would need to be topped off with fuel in orbit, Cichan added.\n \n\n   \n  He noted  that the refueling process in that case would not, however, be as complex as attempting to refuel cryogenically powered spacecraft, such as Blue Origin’s lander or SpaceX’s Starship, in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  Transferring stable fuels between vehicles in orbit is a less risky proposition and has been taking place on the International Space Station since 2000, Cichan explained. “The Russians and Soviets have been doing it all the way back to the ‘70s,” Cichan said. “So that’s very known technology.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked what would make Lockheed’s proposal competitive with Blue Origin or SpaceX, Chamers said the company’s “approach is quickest because it leverages existing hardware, minimizes the required cadence of launches, and does not rely on technologies like cryogenic refueling or long duration storage that have never been performed on orbit.”\n \n\n   \n  Other commercial space companies contacted by CNN — including Firefly Aerospace and Northrop Grumman — said simply that they were “ready to support” NASA in its endeavor to find a faster way to complete the Artemis III mission.\n \n\n   \n  They did not confirm whether they would formally respond to the space agency’s anticipated request for   companies to submit proposals.\n \n\n   \n    Back to the drawing board\n \n\n   \n  Experts who spoke with CNN suggested that NASA should stretch its imagination when it comes to the spacecraft that will land astronauts on the moon.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody’s put together a true concept of design,” Loverro said.\n \n\n   \n  “All of that’s doable very quickly,” he noted, adding that he believes a new lander could go from concept to reality within five years.\n \n\n   \n  Loverro suggested that NASA should leverage in-house expertise by leaning on its own Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL, which he said should be empowered to rapidly pursue a lunar lander development program.\n \n\n   \n  While JPL couldn’t do the job alone, because the center is focused on robotic exploration and does not have human spaceflight experience, Loverro noted, the laboratory   has built a reputation over decades for its engineering precision and ability to pull off complex missions on unforgiving timelines.\n \n\n   \n  “You really want that that kind of program management leadership that JPL embodies so well,” Loverro said.\n \n\n   \n    Expensive red herrings\n \n\n   \n  One huge consideration with any of these proposals is the price.\n \n\n   \n  From NASA’s vantage point, SpaceX’s Starship is by far the cheapest proposal because the company is spending so much of its own money on the project. The company even  estimates  it is funding 90% of Starship’s production, test and launch facilities.\n \n\n   \n  None of the other companies CNN spoke with about alternative proposals for NASA’s lunar lander offered cost estimates for bringing their ideas to fruition.\n \n\n   \n  But as with any spaceflight project, it’s safe to assume they won’t be cheap.\n \n\n   \n  NASA’s funds are already limited. While Congress has been on board with supporting the Artemis program — adding $10 billion to bolster lunar efforts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — it’s not clear whether lawmakers would throw even more money at the project in an attempt to speed things up.\n \n\n   \n  The space agency also can’t easily cancel existing contracts with either SpaceX or Blue Origin.\n \n\n   \n  Drier noted, however, that support for the Artemis program does seem to be a stand-out unifying force for lawmakers. He also highlighted the fact that the current administration clearly views Artemis as a priority, allowing work on the program to continue  despite the ongoing government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  But considering the time and money space programs tend to consume, an attempt to hash out a new moon landing plan for Artemis III is an idea that “is probably three years too late to make a difference,” Drier added.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s only ever been one example of a successful human lunar lander in history: The contract for that was awarded in 1962, and it was first demonstrated on Apollo 9 in 1968,” Drier noted.\n \n\n   \n  “So that’s six years — and that cost about 30-ish billion dollars” for the lunar lander alone when adjusted for inflation, which is an exorbitant amount of money that exceeds the agency’s entire annual budget since the mid-1990s, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The space agency’s funding levels have remained far below the highs hit during the Apollo era in the decades since the program concluded.\n \n\n   \n  Another key consideration is time: It’s possible that pursuing one of these alternative options does successfully expedite the Artemis III mission. It’s also possible this pursuit will be an expensive red herring — sucking time and resources away from realizing the plan NASA has been working toward for years.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A base not a race’\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the flurry of conversations around rushing to cobble together a lunar lander, another discussion has been percolating — one that questions whether NASA should be trying to expedite Artemis III at all.\n \n\n   \n  Drier is among the experts who told CNN that they did not view simply landing on the moon before China as essential. The more important goal, they argue, is to pave the way for a permanent lunar base where astronauts can live and work.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX has appeared to support this viewpoint,  saying in its Thursday statement that Starship “will be a central enabler that will fulfill the vision of NASA’s Artemis program, which seeks to establish a lasting presence on the lunar surface, not just flags and footprints, and ultimately forge the path to land the first humans on Mars.”\n \n\n   \n  The company argues that is why Starship remains the best option for NASA’s Artemis program: The vehicle boasts a massive cargo bay and immense power that could be transformational — opening up possibilities once considered unthinkable, such as delivering 100 metric tons of cargo to the moon in one trip, according to SpaceX.\n \n\n   \n  In the public imagination, the new “space race” — as much as it really is a race — may be won or lost the moment the next astronaut sets foot on the moon. But perhaps the true winner will be the country that is able to build lasting infrastructure, experts say.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes great press fodder to frame this as competition,” said one space policy source, who was among several that spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss controversial issues. “But this is about the long game and the sustainability.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/tariff-strategy-trump-canada-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s unusual tariff strategy puts America’s allies in a near-impossible situation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has intensified his use of tariffs as a political and economic tool to pressure foreign nations, even for actions unrelated to trade, such as media content or political criticism.

     8:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has made it clear that his favorite method to gain leverage over opponent countries on the other side of a negotiating table is to  raise tariffs . It doesn’t matter whether the offense is trade-related or not.\n \n\n   \n  If there had been any lingering doubt (and I doubt there was), it was erased when Trump announced last week that he was  increasing tariffs  on Canada by 10% because he didn’t like an  anti-tariff commercial  Ontario aired across the United States. Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s TV ad quoted the late former President Ronald Reagan, who in 1987 criticized the use of general tariffs as a weapon of trade policy.\n \n\n   \n  It might seem obvious that there is no direct causal trade link between Ontario’s and, by extension Canada’s, action and Trump’s threat of raising Canada’s tariffs by 10%. Nevertheless, Trump’s response was hardly a surprise.\n \n\n   \n  The Canadian incident shows countries on the other side of the negotiating table with the United States face a near-impossible situation.\n \n\n   \n  First, they must negotiate trade deals by coming to Washington with a transactional mindset: “What can we offer up?”\n \n\n   \n  Second, they must, at the last minute, be prepared for the US president to want more — so they better have something else up their sleeve they can give as an offering.\n \n\n   \n  And there’s a third wrinkle: Never mind reciprocal tariffs — the United States is in the business of retaliatory tariffs for seemingly unrelated issues. It means no country can know what decision, policy or indiscretion will offend Trump, who may retaliate at virtually any time with further tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  This is uncharted territory, and it is not the normal way of doing business. Traditionally, tariffs have been used to correct a perceived trade imbalance and to protect the home market by making imports more expensive.\n \n\n   \n  What seems clear is that Trump’s love of tariffs will ensure they remain at the heart of US economic policy. I see no scenario in which the president, even after having negotiated a trade deal, doesn’t reserve to himself the right unilaterally to change his mind, threaten and then launch a fresh tariff.\n \n\n   \n  Some of Trump’s tariffs contain at least a scintilla of geo-political logic. For example, his decision to punish India with 50% tariffs came because the country is still buying oil from Russia. One could – just about – argue the tariff was supporting some wider, strategic goal in halting the Russia-Ukraine war.\n \n\n   \n  With others, it remains difficult or impossible to understand the trade purpose of tariffs. Take Brazil’s case: Trump thinks it’s wrong to prosecute the former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for allegedly plotting to overturn an election. Describing the prosecution as “a witch hunt that should end immediately,” Trump raised the tariff to 50% due “in part to Brazil’s insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans.” (The previous tariff had been around 10%.)\n \n\n   \n  According to the Brazilian Specialty Coffee Association, exports of special coffees are now down 70% and the IMF is warning of a more general slowdown in Brazil’s economy because of the tariffs.  The tariff weapon has hit its mark.\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s Colombia. After Colombian President Gustavo Petro criticized Trump’s bombings of alleged drug smugglers off the Caribbean coast, Trump called Petro “an illegal drug leader” who is “low rated” and very unpopular. The punishment: cutting off foreign aid and an unspecified increase in tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  For a country where democracy is often fragile at best, the economic disruption from increased tariffs could have devastating political effects.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also imposed steep tariffs on South Africa for its perceived ill treatment of White farmers and land reforms.\n \n\n   \n  The list goes on. Last week’s threat against Canada only confirmed the trend.\n \n\n   \n  After the last few weeks and months, countries have been warned. No one should be surprised if and when the weapon is fired.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the only country that has stood up to Trump and won is China. Xi Jinping has mastered the careful art of letting Trump appear to win while quietly claiming victory at home.  Xi played his hand perfectly  and came away from their meeting this past week with a reduction in tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s one final wrinkle: The US Supreme Court next week will hear Trump’s appeal of two lower court rulings that found his use of tariffs as leverage to be an illegal use of his emergency powers. If the Supreme Court upholds those rulings, Trump’s favorite tool could be significantly blunted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/michigan-church-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:49:00-04:00","title":"FBI says shooter in deadly Michigan church attack was motivated by hatred toward the Mormon faith","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The former Marine Thomas Jacob Sanford opened fire at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc, Michigan, on September 28, 2025, killing four people and setting the building on fire.

against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the FBI confirmed Friday.\n \n\n   \n  While  friends of the gunman  in the deadly shooting have said he harbored hatred for what is widely known as the Mormon church, the FBI had previously declined to specify the motivation behind the attack that left four people dead and the church burned to the ground, except to say it was a “targeted” act of violence.\n \n\n   \n  The gunman,  Thomas Jacob Sanford , 40, was killed by  law enforcement  responding to the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “I am confirming this is a targeted act of violence believed to be motivated by the assailant’s anti-religious beliefs against the Mormon religious community,” Jennifer Runyan, special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit field office, said in a prerecorded video message. The agency declined to share further information on what led to its conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Sanford drove his pickup truck into the side of a Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, 60 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, on Sunday, Sept. 28, and began shooting at congregants. Authorities have said he used gasoline as an accelerant to then light the church on fire.\n \n\n   \n   Body camera footage  released by Grand Blanc Township police shows an officer yelling, “Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop it now!” One of the officers tells another, “I’ve got your back, back here man. Yeah stay there. Shoot him!”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI said Friday that nine people were injured in the attack.

Its members responded by raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in an  online fundraiser for the gunman’s family .\n \n\n   \n  The church said it strengthened its security protocols for the conference and, days later, for the  funeral of its oldest-ever president , who died a day before the Michigan shooting.\n \n\n   \n  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints did not have a comment Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Brandt Malone, a member of the faith who was attending services at a nearby church on the morning of the shooting, said the FBI’s statement “did confirm some of our darkest fears — that this attack was motivated by hatred.”\n \n\n   \n  “This affects all believers of all religious traditions, and it hurts that there are those out there who are motivated by the darkest of feelings,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Malone grew up attending events at the church where the attack occurred.

People who knew him have said he began vocalizing anti-Mormon sentiments years ago after living in Utah, where he dated and broke up with a girlfriend who was a member of the faith. Sanford had moved to Utah after leaving the Marines and told his friends he had become addicted to methamphetamines.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney acting as a spokesperson for Sanford’s family did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/travel/travel-news-holiday-travel-season-planning","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"It’s time to plan holiday trips","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers key travel trends and stories shaping holiday planning in 2025.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In our travel news round-up this week: advice for holiday travelers, a robot that could save old languages from dying out, plus a new super-luxurious overnight train in Italy.\n \n\n   \n    Holiday travel preview\n \n\n   \n  Have you thought about holiday travel yet? Time is just about up if you want the best deals on flights for Thanksgiving and Christmas, according to travel company Kayak, which uses search data to analyze trends. The booking “sweet spot for holiday savings” stretches from mid-October to early November, the company says.\n \n\n   \n  Holiday travel set a record in the US last year, and it’s forecast to surpass 2024 levels. Aviation analytics firm Cirium told CNN that passenger bookings on major US airlines for Thanksgiving are up 2.2 percent from last year.\n \n\n   \n  Reservations for Christmas week are up as well, but less than 1 percent, Cirium said.\n \n\n   \n  Hoping to avoid the crowds?  Kayak suggests  flying out for Thanksgiving on Monday, November 24. That day will be the cheapest. As for Christmas, the most affordable day to fly domestically or internationally will be Christmas Eve.\n \n\n   \n  A rush of passengers would be welcome news to America’s travel industry, which the U.S. Travel Association estimates has lost out on $1 billion in consumer spending every week of the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controller staffing shortages have already caused delays at facilities across the country during the monthlong shutdown, and it could get worse.\n \n\n   \n  Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches, Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy  warned on Thursday , after a roundtable at the White House with aviation, travel and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s going to lead to massive delays,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  At LaGuardia Airport in New York earlier this week, Duffy said safety would never be compromised, but staffing shortages often result in slower rates of departures and arrivals.\n \n\n   \n  “If we have issues, we will slow it down,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  AAA recommends travelers arrive at the airport extra early in case of TSA security line delays caused by potential staffing shortages.\n \n\n   \n    Still time to get spooked\n \n\n   \n  Halloween weekend’s not over yet, and some “spooky explorers” hunt for ghosts all year long. Here’s why paranormal tourists  spend big money on terrifying trips . And ghosts aren’t the only attractions around the globe that are  macabre and mysterious .\n \n\n   \n    Italy’s ‘dolce vita’ just got sweeter\n \n\n   \n  A luxurious new train service in Italy is giving travelers a taste of the good life while spiriting them through the stunning countryside, with glimpses of Tuscany’s famed hill towns.  CNN spent 24 hours on board .\n \n\n   \n  The aptly named Dolce Vita Orient Express, which was unveiled earlier this year, is Italy’s first homegrown luxury train. It’s meant to evoke the panache of post-war Italy as exemplified by the films of Federico Fellini, including,  chiaramente , the 1960 classic, “La Dolce Vita.”\n \n\n   \n  Travelers can choose among 18 itineraries. A single day on the train is a 24-hour fever dream of wood paneling, wine and pampering. And it all begins at Rome’s updated Ostiense station.\n \n\n   \n  While train travel is often the way to go in Europe, it continues to face obstacles in the US.  America’s fast train  — NextGen Acela — made its public debut on August 27, but the new trains are rarely able to reach their max speed of 160 miles per hour because of the tracks they’re riding on.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Welcome to Paradise’\n \n\n   \n  After Anesu Masube’s mother died shortly before Christmas in 2017, he rushed back to his native Zimbabwe from Washington, DC, and he expected it to be  the worst flight of his life .\n \n\n   \n  His last-minute booking saddled him with the middle seat, which is especially uncomfortable for someone like Masube, who’s 6-foot-3-inches tall.\n \n\n   \n  But he managed to get moved to an exit row where the woman beside him greeted him by saying with a smile, “Welcome to Paradise.”\n \n\n   \n    In case you missed it\n \n\n   \n   Are American tourists easily distinguishable from Canadians? \n \n\n   \n  Let  the debate  begin.\n \n\n   \n   A private phone number, secret opening times, and no interest in Michelin. \n \n\n   \n  Inside one of Tokyo’s  invite-only  restaurants.\n \n\n   \n   This new tech could save old languages from dying out \n \n\n   \n  It’s a  robot  that’s works like a talking Elmo   toy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/apec-summit-xi-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"06:31:00-04:00","title":"China’s Xi in the limelight at Pacific summit with Trump conspicuous by his absence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, China’s President Xi Jinping took a prominent role due to the conspicuous absence of U.S. President Donald Trump, who had recently engaged in a trade deal with China.

at Pacific summit with Trump conspicuous by his absence \n       \n  By Helen Regan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:31 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Leaders of Pacific countries and territories, including China’s Xi Jinping, adopted a joint declaration on trade and investment at a major summit in South Korea Saturday. But the leader of one global powerhouse is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The US president flew out of South Korea Thursday, moments after his  landmark meeting  with his Chinese counterpart that appeared to  de-escalate the protracted trade conflict  between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  With Trump choosing to skip the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation – which groups together countries accounting for more than half of global trade – Xi stepped into the limelight by calling for unity, cooperation and proposing a global body to govern artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his absence, Trump’s protectionist trade policies and punishing global tariffs have loomed over the two-day event in the city of Gyeongju. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stood in for Trump during the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific signed the “Gyeongju Declaration,” which included commitments to cooperate on economic recovery and growth. The leaders also adopted an AI initiative and a framework to respond to demographic changes caused by low birth rates and aging populations.\n \n\n   \n  “The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum in his opening remarks Friday. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”\n \n\n   \n  “China’s door to openness will not close; it will only open wider,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year was on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.\n \n\n   \n  In their declaration, the leaders acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges,” and as su﻿ch they would “support efforts to ensure resilient supply chains” and “create new drivers of growth” through digital innovations, including AI.\n \n\n   \n  “We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “Only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee also sat down for talks with Xi, who is on a state visit to South Korea, in the first summit meeting between the two leaders. The two discussed ways to expand cooperation and advance denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean presidential office.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the talks, Lee said the relationship between Seoul and Beijing has “not completely recovered yet” and there was a need to “find the path for helping one another.” He looked forward to China playing a role in promoting peace on the peninsula, Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea called talk of denuclearization a “pipedream” that will never be realized. The country’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho accused South Korea of lacking “common sense” for refusing to acknowledge Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Among the high-profile meetings Xi had on the sidelines of APEC was with Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.\n \n\n   \n  Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  “I aim to maintain communication with you and therefore jointly promote the development of China-Japan relations along the right track,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi faced a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes. \n \n\n   \n  She told reporters after the meeting that China and Japan agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship.” But Takaichi said she also expressed concerns to Xi on sensitive issues including Chinese export controls on rare earths, China’s activity in the East China Sea, and the detention of Japanese nationals in China.\n \n\n   \n  “I also asked China to resume Japanese beef and seafood imports,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting appeared in stark contrast to the  warm camaraderie  showed by Takaichi and Trump in Tokyo just days before, when the two allies had embarked on a “new golden age” of relations. Takaichi and Trump demonstrated a close bond complete with smiles, fist pumps and jokes.\n \n\n   \n  For Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, meeting with Xi marked a “turning point” in their relationship, according to his office.\n \n\n   \n  In an earlier speech that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”\n \n\n   \n  Carney had been looking for a reset of Canada-China relations after years of worsening ties and  diplomatic rows . Trade negotiations with the US, Canada’s biggest trading partner, are at  a dead end , and Carney said at the APEC summit that he was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders “affirmed their commitment to renewing the relationship between their two countries in a pragmatic and constructive way” and discussed a framework “to deepen cooperation across a range of areas – from clean and conventional energy, to agriculture, manufacturing, climate change, and international finance,” the prime minister’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Carney also accepted an invitation to visit China and both leaders “directed their officials to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Carney said that he had apologized to Trump for a  political advertisement  that angered the President so much that he terminated trade talks with Canada.\n \n\n   \n  “I did apologize to the President,” Carney said when asked by a reporter about the issue on Saturday. “The President was offended by the ad. It’s not something I would have done… which is to put in place that advertisement, and so I apologized to him.”\n \n\n   \n  The ad was released last month by the government of Canada’s Ontario province and featured audio from  a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan  criticizing tariffs on foreign goods.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/africa/tanzania-hassan-landslide-election-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:28:00-04:00","title":"Tanzania’s Hassan declared landslide winner in election marred by violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tanzania’s electoral commission declared President Samia Suluhu Hassan the winner of a presidential election marred by violent protests, with her receiving 97.66% of the votes and a turnout of 87% of registered voters.

devastating impact as storm heads north \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:19 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after  Hurricane Melissa  tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds have  already unleashed  widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa lashed Bermuda as a Category 1 storm overnight Thursday into Friday as the storm passed the islands, bringing quick-hitting bursts of strong wind and rain. The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical as it races south of Newfoundland into cooler Atlantic water.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the storm, authorities in Bermuda closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands across the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  At least 50 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.\n \n\n   \n  The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.\n \n\n   \n    Jamaica hardest hit\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica took the  heaviest battering . Melissa made landfall there as a  Category 5 storm , with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).\n \n\n   \n  “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit coastal town of Black River on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  People gathering around the Black River Bridge searched for water, food and news about their loved ones. The Jamaican Defense Forces have landed in the area by helicopter, but desperation is setting in for residents, Van Dam reported. Many are trying to leave the area with their personal items by car, motorbike or on foot.\n \n\n   \n  Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15 feet of storm surge from Hurricane Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.\n \n\n   \n  The heat and humidity are complicating recovery efforts. There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”\n \n\n   \n  “What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17 th  century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.\n \n\n   \n  But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.\n \n\n   \n  In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, education minister Dana Morris Dixon said in a Tuesday  statement .\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, more than 13,000 residents were still in shelters, while 72% of the island was without power,  Jamaican government officials  said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, minister for local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel pushing more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Schools around the capital Kingston on the eastern side of the island are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba\n \n\n   \n  Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday. The country sustained “extensive damage,” according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n \n\n   \n  This included flooding, mudslides, property destruction and infrastructure damage, particularly in Cuba’s eastern regions, where hundreds of rural communities were left isolated.\n \n\n   \n  As many as 140,000 people were cut off due to rising rivers as the storm passed, according to  the Red Cross . In the province of Santiago, at least 241 communities were cut off due to the storm, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were evacuated in Cuba as Melissa approached.\n \n\n   \n  Cuba’s foreign ministry said it is in touch with the US State Department to get clarity on how the United States would be willing to help with recovery.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio  announced  earlier Thursday that the US is “prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance” to the Cuban people – both directly and through local partners.\n \n\n   \n  The administration of President Donald Trump has historically taken a hard-line stance against the communist-ruled island. In June, the president signed a  memorandum  that the White House said would increase pressure on the Cuban government and support the long-running US economic embargo of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio said Thursday that US law includes exemptions that authorize private donations of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to Cuba, as well as disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío responded to the offer by  saying : “We have been in contact with the State Department and are awaiting clarification on how and in what way they are willing to assist.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuba is already receiving some aid from partners such as China and Venezuela, as well as the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n    High death toll in Haiti\n \n\n   \n  The highest death toll so far has been reported in Haiti, where the hurricane did not make direct landfall but caused significant damage and at least 30 deaths, Reuters said. Twenty of these fatalities, including 10 children, were due to flooding in Petit-Goâve, where a flooded river burst its banks.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    International efforts\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding. The British government also said it was chartering a limited number of flights to help British nationals leave Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the UK pledged an additional an additional 5 million pounds ($6.5 million).\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  on Tuesday showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/gaza-israel-isf-trump-plan-ceasefire-cnn","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00Z","title":"NIST Develops Room-Temperature Quantum Sensor with Revolutionary Magnetic Field Detection Capabilities","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a novel quantum sensor that can detect minute changes in magnetic fields with high precision.

 Source: CNN\n \n   \n  More likely than not, someone in your community — whether  friend, family or neighbor  — uses   SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  As  millions of people could lose access to food assistance programs  during the government shutdown, many Americans are trying — in however small a way — to fill in the gaps for people at risk of being left behind.\n \n\n   \n   Two federal judges ruled that the Trump administration has to tap into emergency funds  to at least partially cover November food assistance. But the aid, which was scheduled to disperse on the first of the month, will still be delayed reaching recipients.\n \n\n   \n  Tee Tran, the owner of Vietnamese restaurant Monster Pho in Oakland, California, knows the struggle all too well. He was one of the thousands of Vietnamese boat people, eventually reaching California in 1989, where his mother worked five jobs and used SNAP benefits to keep food on the table. Now he’s decided to give away free meals to children receiving help through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and a discount for their parents.\n \n\n   \n  “When I see these kids going through this and not having food, it really makes me think of me,” Tran said. “I know how it’s like when you look up to your parents and they want to give you so much … but financially they can’t do it.”\n \n\n   \n  But even though people are pitching in as much as they can to help, there are few options for families that help as much as food stamps. \n \n\n   \n  “No food bank, no charitable organization, can fill the gap if November SNAP isn’t provided,” Stefanie Shuman, Food Bank For New York City’s communications director, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Check with local businesses\n \n\n   \n  Kevin Cassidy, the owner of a chain restaurant on Long Island called KC’s Pizza & Wings, made a heartfelt post on social media saying he would provide a free meal, no questions asked, to anyone presenting a SNAP/EBT card. He didn’t expect the flood of support.\n \n\n   \n  In two days, he said he got over $1,000 in donations and hundreds of messages from people around the country asking how they can help. Now, he’s planning on prepping pre-made meals, working with a local food bank and using community donations to give out gift cards to local grocers.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is struggling a bit, and when you help others it comes back tenfold. The only way to receive is to give,” Cassidy said.\n \n\n   \n  Tran, the owner of Monster Pho, said he has lost 30% of his business in the past six months because of tariffs, immigration restrictions and reduced spending from his customers. That’s why he’s offering free meals to children and a discount to their parents, to help as much as he can without going under.\n \n\n   \n    Donate to a food bank\n \n\n   \n  Food Banks say that cash donations are more helpful than giving food directly if people are able to do so, because they are able to buy a lot more food in bulk themselves. In New York City, for example, $1 can provide up to 5 meals at Food Bank For NYC.\n \n\n   \n  Many companies also match employee donations to organizations such as these, so check with your employer, as well.\n \n\n   \n  The money goes a long way, especially right now.  Food banks have already been feeling the strain  due to increased lines and higher prices of food.\n \n\n   \n    Grocery Buddies\n \n\n   \n  Other people are using online forums to act as “grocery buddies” for families at risk of losing benefits,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors post in these community groups that they are willing to be a “grocery buddy,” offering help to whoever needs. Then, the parties figure what that help will look like, whether that means shopping together, using gift cards or something else.\n \n\n   \n    Local food pantry and mutual aid groups\n \n\n   \n  For those donating physical food, food bank groups said the best options are non-perishables. Key items include proteins such as canned chicken, tuna and salmon, as well as beans and nut butters. Pastas and rice also have a long shelf life.\n \n\n   \n  Other items food banks and local groups tend to need are hygiene products, such as tampons, pads, diapers and wipes, which can eat away at peoples’ grocery budgets.\n \n\n   \n    Call your local representative\n \n\n   \n  Other advocates say an easy and free way to take action is to call your local representative as the government is still shut down.\n \n\n   \n  Some local and state governments have stepped up to attempt to fill the gap left by SNAP, though it’s still not enough to totally cover the amount of aid.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no face to hunger. It’s oftentimes, again, working families… (when) the wage has not kept pace with the cost of living,” Shuman said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby and Alisha Ebrahimji contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/shutdown-congress-divided","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The problem is everybody wants to win: Congress bitterly deadlocked as shutdown pain skyrockets","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government is on the verge of experiencing the longest shutdown in history, with Congress deadlocked over funding.

     5:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown is on the verge of becoming the longest in US history — and lawmakers still have no idea how much longer it will go.\n \n\n   \n  In Washington, senators left town for the weekend deadlocked and more frustrated than ever, while  critical safety net programs  could soon lose federal funding for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits for the month of November. President Donald Trump said later Friday he’d instructed administration lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits, adding that if “given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  But he noted that even immediate guidance from the courts would result in delayed benefits for food stamp recipients — which could still only be  a partial and short-term fix . Tens of millions of Americans are still bracing for a crisis that will leave them without the government assistance they need to eat, heat their homes or take care of their kids while they work.\n \n\n   \n  And after a week abroad, Trump announced his return with a missive that threatens to further complicate the path out of the shutdown: calling for eliminating the Senate filibuster in a “nuclear” move that even his closest congressional allies worry would only do more damage in the long run.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, the problem is everybody wants to win,” GOP Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia, who has advocated for Trump to get more directly involved in negotiations to reopen the government, said of the standoff in the Senate. “And you’ve got a lot of people really hurting, and that really upsets me.”\n \n\n   \n  “I imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” fumed Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who has repeatedly bucked his party and sided with Republicans on the funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  Privately, lawmakers of both parties have acknowledged in recent days they need to find a way out of the shutdown in the next week or two or else face even more dire consequences, according to interviews with a half-dozen sources.\n \n\n   \n  And publicly, many are hopeful that the skyrocketing pressure on both Republicans and Democrats will force the two sides to find a deal.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s going to be a flood of phone calls from people saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, my health care is going to go up by that much?” Sen. Chris Coons, a centrist Democrat from Delaware, told CNN, referring to the spiking premiums that his party has made a central demand in the funding fight. But he said phone lines would, too, be lighting up for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “I also think Democrats are going to get a flood of calls from people saying, wait, wait a minute. My SNAP and WIC is going to be…? So I think there will be building pressure on both parties to find a path forward.”\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate and House GOP leaders are confident Democrats will cave shortly after the November 4 elections, several of the sources said. Many point to a flurry of talks with some centrist Democrats to end the shutdown, perhaps in exchange for a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that remain Democrats’ biggest demand in the funding fight, as well as a commitment to full-year spending bills.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope it frees people up to move forward with opening government,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Election Day on Tuesday, claiming Democrats would be more willing to yield when they’re not “concerned about turnout” in key races in Virginia and New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Yet several people close to Democratic leaders insist the party is unwilling to back down for a show vote. After more than 30 days of insisting on a clear commitment on the health care issue, many Democrats will be unswayed by unofficial commitments: They want to hear directly from Trump.\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown has dragged on, even some Republicans have grown antsy as Johnson has kept the House out of session since September 19 and lawmakers have remained in their districts.\n \n\n   \n  “People ask, ‘Do you like being here in the district?’ Of course I do because I get to see all of my constituents,” GOP Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told reporters on Tuesday from Washington. “But I also would tell you that we are built to work here. We are all built to be here and doing our jobs and late nights and early mornings and trying to figure out a path forward. And so, it’s a little unusual.”\n \n\n   \n  Many House lawmakers concede they don’t know what will happen if the shutdown extends past November 21, the date of the House-passed government funding extension.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also pointed to Trump’s late-night call for nuking the filibuster, which injected fresh uncertainty into the situation and raised further questions about the role the president might play in resolving the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In a Friday statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that “if Democrats won’t do what’s best for the American people, the nuclear options will need to be invoked,” though she did not offer a specific timeline. Top GOP leaders, meanwhile, were quick to swat away the suggestion of weakening the custom, while maintaining that Trump and Republicans in Congress were united in ending the shutdown without ceding any ground to Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  That includes Trump’s resistance to any further meetings with Hill leaders, despite constant requests from Democratic senators.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, shot down GOP leaders’ offer earlier this month to guarantee a vote on the floor on ACA subsidies in exchange for Democratic votes to end the shutdown, quipping, “I’m not sure that Leader Thune is really the leader of the Senate.”\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have insisted that their stance remains unchanged, and that there won’t be any negotiations until Democrats cave and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “Let them open up the country, and we’ll meet,” Trump said Friday. “We’ll meet very quickly. But they have to open up the country.”\n \n\n   \n  But in the days before Trump returned to the US, aides had privately discussed options for enticing Democrats to give in, including agreeing to undo the administration’s recent mass firing of federal workers in exchange for reopening the government, two people familiar with the deliberations told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Those conversations were preliminary and did not yield any final decisions, the people familiar cautioned, especially amid concerns that it would hand Democrats an opportunity to claim they won the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  Another suggestion discussed by GOP officials — that Trump invite Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House next week to try to broker an end to the impasse — was swiftly ruled out. One senior congressional GOP aide stressed that it was never a real option.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the behind-the-scenes activity offers a window into the increasing urgency to end the shutdown before more pain hits Americans across the country — and the lingering concern within the administration over which side will bear the brunt of the political fallout.\n \n\n   \n  In recent polling, more voters still blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown than they do Democrats. And while the expiration of food aid has pushed more Democrats to seek an end to the shutdown, it’s also worried a swath of Republicans who represent the millions of red-district voters reliant on SNAP — and are already under pressure over high prices, health care and other economic issues.\n \n\n   \n  “The question becomes, who politically gets the blame?” said one GOP adviser involved in the shutdown discussions. “If Republicans are really feeling the tide shifting on that one there may be a more political imperative to get this solved.”\n \n\n   \n  Within Trump’s orbit, aides and advisers are largely resigned to the shutdown blowing past the 35-day record set during his first term, three people close to the White House said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet they are still holding out some hope that the impasse won’t last much beyond Tuesday’s elections, believing Democrats are increasingly eager to find an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, insist it’s Trump who needs to offer them one.\n \n\n   \n  “We could end this at any moment, if we can get the right people in the room, and that includes the president. He spent an hour on this, as far as I could tell, in a month. An hour. How much time has he spent on his ballroom?” Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told reporters this week.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/judge-blocks-trump-citizenship-proof-voting-form","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00-04:00","title":"Federal Judge Rules Trump Can’t Require Citizenship Proof on Federal Voting Form","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that President Donald Trump’s attempt to require documentary proof of citizenship on federal voter registration forms is unconstitutional, as it violates the separation of powers by placing election regulation beyond the authority of Congress and the states.

      \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:57 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form cannot be enforced, a federal judge ruled Friday.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, DC, sided with Democratic and civil rights groups that sued the Trump administration over a March executive order to overhaul US elections.\n \n\n   \n  She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in US elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion.\n \n\n   \n  She further emphasized that on matters related to setting qualifications for voting and regulating federal election procedures, “the Constitution assigns no direct role to the President in either domain.”\n \n\n   \n  Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when  she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue. \n \n\n   \n  The ruling grants the plaintiffs a partial summary judgment that prohibits the proof-of-citizenship requirement from going into effect. It says the US Election Assistance Commission, which has been considering adding the requirement to the federal voter form, is permanently barred from taking action to do so.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin of the ACLU, one of the plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling “a clear victory for our democracy. President Trump’s attempt to impose a documentary proof of citizenship requirement on the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional power grab.”\n \n\n   \n  A message seeking comment from the White House was not immediately returned.\n \n\n   \n  While a top priority for Republicans, attempts to implement documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voting have been fraught. The US House passed a citizenship mandate last spring that has stalled in the Senate, and several attempts to pass similar legislation in the states have proved equally difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Such requirements have created problems and confusion for voters when they have taken effect at the state level. It presents particular hurdles for married women who have changed their name, since they might need to show birth certificates and marriage certificates as well as state IDs. Those complications arose earlier this year when a proof-of-citizenship requirement took effect for the first time during local elections in New Hampshire.\n \n\n   \n  In Kansas, a proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in effect for three years created chaos before it was overturned in federal court. Some 30,000 otherwise eligible people were prevented from registering to vote.\n \n\n   \n  Voting by noncitizens also has been shown to be rare.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit brought by the DNC and various civil rights groups will continue to play out to allow the judge to consider other challenges to Trump’s order. That includes a requirement that all mailed ballots be received, rather than just postmarked, by Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Other lawsuits against Trump’s election executive order are ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  In early April, 19 Democratic state attorneys general asked a separate federal court to reject Trump’s executive order. Washington and Oregon, where virtually all voting is done with mailed ballots, followed with their own lawsuit against the order.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/us-japan-trump-takaichi-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00-04:00","title":"In Tokyo, Trump and Takaichi bonded over a mutual friend – and a mutual enemy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a high-profile meeting in Tokyo, Donald Trump and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi displayed a close, personal rapport reminiscent of old friends, rooted in their shared conservative political views and personal ties to former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

7:58 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  During their closely watched  first meeting  in Tokyo, Donald Trump and Sanae Takaichi looked more like old friends than world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  There were smiles, back slaps, hugs and even a joke about running late because they’d been watching the LA Dodgers – led by Japanese megastar Shohei Ohtani – play in the World Series.\n \n\n   \n  The US president received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination (the second of his Asia trip), and a golf putter previously owned by the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who famously bonded with Trump on the green.\n \n\n   \n  Their easy camaraderie continued at the Yokosuka naval base, where Trump invited  Takaichi  on stage aboard the USS George Washington and praised her leadership. The new Japanese PM responded with a triumphant fist pump and a twirl, a moment that quickly went viral in her country.\n \n\n   \n  The message was unmistakable: the  Abe-era chemistry between Washington and Tokyo  is back.\n \n\n   \n  “She is a delight,” Trump told business leaders at the conclusion of the day’s activities. “I got to know her pretty well in a short period of time.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not often Trump shows this level of warmth toward a foreign leader, particularly one from a country that’s weathered his tariff wars. It’s just as rare to see a Japanese prime minister display such open affection on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  It certainly helps that the two see eye to eye on several political issues. Both are right-wing conservatives who support military buildup and a tougher stance on China. Their shared connection to Abe also helps explain their rapport. Abe was one of Trump’s “best friends” in global politics, as well as being Takaichi’s political mentor.\n \n\n   \n  But beneath the photo ops and nostalgia also lies a strategic alliance born of mutual need. Especially as both leaders eye the same adversary in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, having a staunch ally in the Asia-Pacific region willing to take a hard line against China is an undeniable win. Takaichi, a longtime China hawk, has criticized Beijing’s military expansion and economic coercion for years. Her hardline stance dovetails neatly with Trump’s “America First” worldview.\n \n\n   \n  The two also unveiled a new framework on rare earths, aimed at reducing dependence on China’s near-monopoly over critical resources. Details were vague, but the message of cooperation was clear. Japan still remembers the 2010 “rare earths shock,” when Beijing cut off exports after a territorial dispute. Takaichi has since made securing stable supply chains a key part of her economic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Trade and investment also featured prominently at the summit. Japan pledged roughly $490 billion in US-bound investments, led by companies in AI, semiconductors, defense and advanced manufacturing, part of a broader trade deal already agreed upon by the allies in September.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, who prizes loyalty and has a long memory for slights, an allegiance to Japan solidified early in his first term. Abe took great care to develop the US-Japan relationship, at a time when the president did not have a lot of support on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  Foreign dignitaries and leaders  openly laughed  at the president during a 2018 United Nations General Assembly address. In 2019, a group of NATO leaders were  captured  on camera gossiping about him.\n \n\n   \n  But Abe cultivated his American counterpart with thoughtful gestures that played directly to Trump’s interests: multiple golf outings, the pomp and circumstance of a state banquet, and a trip to a sumo wrestling tournament where Trump bestowed the winner with a “President’s Cup.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump remained close to his counterpart until Abe’s assassination in 2022, and hosted his widow at Mar-a-Lago last year.\n \n\n   \n  That goodwill paved the way for Takaichi’s success on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “He really likes her,” said a senior Trump administration official who observed their interactions behind closed doors.\n \n\n   \n  She also benefited from timing: Takaichi took office after Trump’s reciprocal tariffs rocked markets and reimagined US alliances – shielding her from tangling with the Trump administration to negotiate a trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  For Takaichi, standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump strengthens her hand at home. Her approval ratings soared after taking office, but her ruling party still lacks a parliamentary majority after recent election losses. Public frustration over past scandals also lingers. Projecting Japan’s influence abroad, and reaffirming its bond with Washington, helps her rebuild political capital.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, the optics are just as valuable. Hardening a close alliance with Tokyo gives him diplomatic momentum ahead of a more contentious meeting with China’s Xi Jinping. It’s also a reminder to Beijing that he’s not short on powerful friends in the region.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/portland-national-guard-deployment-trial","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00+00:00","title":"Federal Judge to Rule on Fate of National Guard in Portland as Legal Battle Over ICE Facility Protests Intensifies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal trial is underway to determine whether the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect an ICE facility, violates state sovereignty and judicial orders.

The Trump administration claims that protests have been violent and coordinated, citing incidents such as rock-throwing, attempts to breach the facility, and the use of improvised weapons; however, local officials and attorneys argue that the protests are generally peaceful, and that the use of force by federal agents has escalated tensions and endangered local officers.

Here’s what the trial revealed \n       \n  By Jason Kravarik, Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A trial to decide the  fate of the National Guard deployments  in Oregon concluded Friday, leaving Portland residents, Trump administration officials and hundreds of soldiers in limbo as they await the judge’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Karin Immergut presided over the three-day trial that featured a surprising revelation: National Guard troops were on the ground at Portland’s ICE facility earlier this month even after the judge ordered them not to show up.\n \n\n   \n  The trial also provided insight on what top federal and National Guard officials knew — and didn’t know — when President Donald Trump called for hundreds of troops to protect the ICE facility that has faced months of protests.\n \n\n   \n  As Oregon and California challenge the effort to send 400 soldiers from their states to the facility, federal attorneys argued during the trial it’s within Trump’s presidential authority to respond to the daily protests outside the facility that have subjected the building and its agents to what it described as coordinated violence.\n \n\n   \n  But state and city attorneys called the move “one of the most significant infringements” on Oregon’s sovereignty in the state’s history and argued the Trump administration is dramatically misrepresenting the situation and risking inflaming tensions.\n \n\n   \n  “The government cannot create the very emergency they propose to resolve,” Oregon attorney Scott Kennedy said.\n \n\n   \n  Troops have so far been barred from deploying due to two temporary restraining orders from Immergut: one blocking  troops from Oregon  and another blocking  troops from any state . The former order is temporarily on hold after  being appealed  to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n \n\n   \n  Plaintiffs are seeking a ban on deploying National Guard troops to Oregon. The judge, whom  Trump appointed  during his first term, is expected to file a decision by Sunday when the previous order expires. The decision is expected to draw a quick appeal from the losing side.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ admits soldiers were at ICE facility even after judge’s order\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced abruptly in a social media post last month that he would order Oregon National Guard troops to Portland, hurling his administration into a legal showdown with the state.\n \n\n   \n  As the case played out, Immergut issued an initial restraining order on October 4 blocking the deployment. But government attorneys admitted this week that Guard soldiers were already at the facility – and remained there for hours after her order.\n \n\n   \n  Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  The judge briefly pressed the Trump administration on whether the soldiers’ presence might have been in contempt of her order, questioning why the government would deploy those Guard members while knowing her ruling on the restraining order was imminent.\n \n\n   \n  “The government deployed that very night that I told you I would issue an opinion,” Immergut said. “Does that not seem in bad faith?”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think so,” Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton replied, adding that the Guard members were needed at the ICE building prior to the judge’s ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Immergut questioned why the Oregon National Guard members didn’t vacate the ICE facility for hours after her restraining order was issued, yet California troops were able to arrive in Oregon by the next day.\n \n\n   \n  “Doesn’t that seem odd?” she asked.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton told her the direction to comply with her order “went high up in the chain of command,” and a four-star general was involved. He argued it took time to implement the order. “There are steps that it has to go through.”\n \n\n   \n  “My clients were working to end the mission,” Hamilton said.\n \n\n   \n  The issue was tabled after Immergut suggested there could be a separate hearing on the potential order violation.\n \n\n   \n    ICE facility official was surprised by Guard deployment\n \n\n   \n  Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, one of those officials testified.\n \n\n   \n  A deputy regional director for the Federal Protective Service, identified in court by the initials R.C., said he and his boss, the FPS regional director, found out about the order on the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I was surprised,” R.C. said.\n \n\n   \n  “Your first thought was ‘What would I do with 200 National Guard men?’” asked Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, sir,” R.C. said, admitting he already had a large number of FPS and supporting agents staffing the ICE facility. Asked about  Trump’s claim  that Portland is “burning down,” the official said, “I do not agree with the statement that Portland is burning down.”\n \n\n   \n  A high-ranking official in the National Guard Bureau also testified that he had never been to Portland’s ICE facility – or been formally briefed on the conditions there – before he authorized the Guard deployment.\n \n\n   \n  Acting Major General Timothy Rieger said the only direct information he had regarding conditions on the ground in Portland were from the media and other anecdotal accounts.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t know if that (media) footage is from this year or prior years?” asked California attorney Barbara Horne-Petersdorf.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not know the veracity of that footage,” Rieger replied.\n \n\n   \n  Rieger said he was acting on the direction of an internal memo from the Secretary of Defense’s office that was corroborated by a Truth Social post from Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Is the facility ‘under siege’ or under control?\n \n\n   \n  Underpinning the arguments was a fundamental disagreement over how extreme the demonstrations have been – and whether local law enforcement is capable of handling criminal activity or violence when it occurs.\n \n\n   \n  Portland “is not war-ravaged, there is no rebellion, and the laws continue to be enforced every day,” Caroline Turco, an attorney for the city of Portland, said during opening statements.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, a simmering protest scene only ramped up after Trump ordered Guard troops to enter Portland in late September, state and city attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting there have been “sporadic and inexcusable crimes” along with peaceful protests, Oregon’s attorney Scott Kennedy called them “precisely the kinds of challenges” that existing law enforcement can and have handled.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration focused on a particularly chaotic night in June as they argued local law enforcement is unable to fully protect the facility.\n \n\n   \n  The tense June 14 protest resulted in a  riot declaration by Portland police , and drew a crowd that was “very active, high-energy and engaged in active criminal conduct,” said DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis, quoting a report from Oregon State Police Captain Cameron Bailey.\n \n\n   \n  During cross examination on Wednesday, Bailey admitted troopers—who were scheduled to provide mutual aid to Portland police—were not on scene before the protest began.\n \n\n   \n  There was “no immediate law enforcement intervention available at that time?” Davis asked. Bailey agreed, saying troopers were scheduled to start later in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  R.C, the high-ranking official with the Federal Protective Service, said demonstrators that night threw broken glass, rocks and debris at federal agents. There was also an attempt to “breach the facility,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers that night considered using deadly force if protesters entered the building, saying they may have to “go lethal,” according to R.C.\n \n\n   \n  “Protesters were putting chains on the door,” R.C. said. “It shows an attempt to lock the officers in and create a hazard for the team that was there.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that two FPS officers were injured from fireworks thrown at the building and an ICE employee required medical attention after being hit with an object.\n \n\n   \n  Davis also sought to establish that federal officers were getting little help from Portland police by outlining several incidents in which rocks were thrown at the ICE facility without any arrests. One report logged people “using slingshots to shoot cameras” at the ICE facility, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for Oregon and Portland maintain Trump’s lawyers are seizing on a small sample size of dates that ended in violence, instead of a vast majority of nights that remained peaceful.\n \n\n   \n  Portland Police Commander Franz Schoening testified that managing these demonstrations can become complicated because the city’s sanctuary laws limit how officers are able to interact with crowds outside the immigration facility.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not engage in immigration-related enforcement or participate in activities” that could be related to it, Schoening said. That includes clearing crowds in front of the ICE driveway, so the task was left to federal agents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers are also restricted from assisting federal agents if they have begun to deploy munitions like pepper balls and tear gas, Schoening said, citing a law passed in 2020 that limits Portland’s participation with agencies using such munitions.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Unpredictable’ use of force can create safety risks, police commander says\n \n\n   \n  The Portland police commander highlighted starkly different approaches between federal and local law enforcement in handling the protests, saying federal tactics sometimes contribute to the chaos.\n \n\n   \n  Portland police often have different interpretations of the level of threat outside the ICE facility, Schoening said, including on October 18, when federal agents used munitions on the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “We simply didn’t see that (as necessary),” Schoening said.\n \n\n   \n  That night, police witnessed a federal officer launching tear gas canisters that “skipped off of their driveway and went onto the roof of the ICE facility where other officers were standing.”\n \n\n   \n  That prompted those federal officers to deploy more munitions, he said. “Our officers were impacted by those munitions.”\n \n\n   \n  The commander said he was “startled” to see the amount of force often employed by federal agents, noting it was “disproportionate to the level of criminal conduct we are seeing down there.”\n \n\n   \n  The use of force against demonstrators has at times threatened the safety of nearby Portland officers, Schoening added. When federal agents use “indiscriminate force,” he said, including the “unpredictable” use of chemical crowd dispersal agents, local police do not get a warning.\n \n\n   \n  “Officers face safety risks themselves,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration, however, argues federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters that justifies a more forceful  response.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton said the protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence. “The agitators coordinate their activity, including their information-gathering techniques.”\n \n\n   \n  The government also dismissed the state’s claim that National Guard presence escalates the tensions on the ground, saying there is no substantive evidence that has occurred.\n \n\n   \n  “It is totally speculative that there will be inflamed tensions and that inflamed tensions would impact plaintiffs in any way,” Hamilton said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/letitia-james-challenges-appointment-us-attorney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:57:00Z","title":"New York AG Letitia James challenges appointment of US attorney in Albany","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a motion to challenge the appointment of John Sarcone as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, arguing that the appointment is illegal, retaliatory, and violates state sovereignty and her First Amendment rights.

Another challenge involving Lindsay Halligan, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who spearheaded separate criminal cases against James and former FBI Director James Comey, will be heard next month.\n \n\n   \n  James’ motion was filed under seal, then made public late Friday by Judge Lorna Schofield, who granted the attorney general’s request to unseal the motion.

    \n  By Nayeli Jaramillo-Plata, Amanda Musa, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Sat November 1, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Alejandra doesn’t leave her home unless she really needs to. She skips doctor’s appointments and church to remain undetected. And if she is detained by immigration enforcement officials, her 13-year-old son is prepared with a list of people to call and his social security number memorized.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot be separated from my kids,” said the 30-year-old undocumented mother of four children who were born in the United States. “I just can’t risk it.” CNN agreed to only use Alejandra’s first name to protect her identity out of respect for her safety concerns due to her immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  The idea that her family might be ripped apart only crossed her mind recently, she said, when President Donald Trump’s nationwide  immigration crackdown  penetrated the humble, quiet Nebraska community she calls home.\n \n\n   \n  In June, a  meatpacking plant in Omaha  was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in what the agency described as the  largest worksite operation  in the state since the start of the Trump administration. Alejandra says several family friends and church acquaintances were among the dozens of people detained.\n \n\n   \n  As that event continues to generate aftershocks, a new ICE detention center, dubbed the  “Cornhusker Clink,”  is opening in western Nebraska soon and is expected to hold up to 300 adults, a spokesperson for Nebraska’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen told CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The facility will join other new ICE detention centers in Republican-led states, including “ Alligator Alcatraz ” in Florida, “Louisiana Lockup” or  “Camp 57”  in Louisiana, and “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana.\n \n\n   \n  These new ICE facilities “are significantly expanding detention space to house the worst of the worst illegal aliens,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN Wednesday. “We look forward to the opening of this new partnership with Nebraska very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s office has estimated the contract with DHS will bring around $14 million annually to the state. Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for the governor’s office described it as “the latest action undertaken by Gov. Pillen to stand with President Trump and protect Americans from criminal illegal aliens. The facility will not only serve Nebraska, but also other states in the region.”\n \n\n   \n  Sitting hundreds of miles away from the border, the opening of “Cornhusker Clink” may solidify Nebraska’s place in the national immigration debate. Unlike many states at the center of immigration enforcement operations, Nebraska is under full Republican control and its governor hasn’t shied away from the conversation.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen signed a  January executive order  expressing his support for federal immigration policy, ordered Nebraska National Guard deployments to Texas, and facilitated the  troops’ activation  ahead of recent ICE protests in his state. He also touted the alleged  arrest of a MS-13 “kingpin”  in Omaha this summer.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, immigration advocates, some state lawmakers and business leaders said it’s a contrast from the previously welcoming atmosphere they have worked to build in the state, especially to strengthen its economy.\n \n\n   \n    Nebraska’s immigrant workforce under threat\n \n\n   \n  Unlike other states, Nebraska is not often seen of as a haven for immigrants, but parts of the state are an enclave for Latinos, who have lived and worked in the Cornhusker state for many years in part due to the meat packing industry, immigration advocates and business leaders in the state say.\n \n\n   \n  Today, much of Nebraska’s Latino population is second, third, or even fourth generation. In rural towns like Schuyler, Lexington and Madison, which some call “Latino Pueblos,” some business owners and community leaders were initially drawn by jobs at meat-packing plants and stayed for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Now, immigration operations are threatening the stability of these small communities and industry operations in Nebraska, said John Hansen, president of the  Nebraska Farmers Union .\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an awful lot of folks that are just afraid to show up to work, afraid to be seen in public,” said Hansen, noting many farms and meatpacking plants are struggling to stay staffed.\n \n\n   \n  Nebraska’s meatpacking industry, which includes major processing facilities for JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield, depends on immigrant labor. Immigrants, many of whom are undocumented, represent about 53% of the state’s workforce, according to the  Migration Policy Institute .\n \n\n   \n  Immigration raids, rising deportation fears and political shifts have created “an atmosphere of fear and intimidation,” among workers, Hansen said, and some union members have privately expressed regret about voting for Trump, who won a majority of the state’s vote in the 2024 election, citing mass deportation and tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The state is experiencing a severe labor shortage, with only 70 available workers for every 100 open jobs as of August, according to data from the  US Chamber of Commerce .\n \n\n   \n  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly claimed  immigrants were taking jobs from Americans.  But in actuality, immigrants were  filling critical labor gaps,  economists say.\n \n\n   \n  While meat packing jobs initially built stable, middle-class lives, Hansen said, injuries like carpal tunnel surged as assembly lines became faster and more repetitive by the 1960s and 1970s, leading to an exodus of American workers. Then, immigrants filled the gap, shaping Nebraska’s farms, factories and towns for decades, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Immigrants, like Alejandra’s family who first migrated from Mexico to Iowa, as well as Latinos born in the US, have spent decades inside those plants, cutting, trimming, packing and processing meat that ends up on dinner tables across America.\n \n\n   \n  Ness Sandoval, a professor at Saint Louis University who studies inequality and Latino and immigrant demography, recalls growing up in Nebraska and his dad’s grueling job at a meatpacking plant.\n \n\n   \n  “He had no time or energy to go to any of my events or sports. He would make an effort when it was something meaningful, but he had to be in bed like at 8 o’clock,” Sandoval said. “It’s a very physical job on the body.”\n \n\n   \n  Injuries were once so routine Sandoval’s father was given an award for going a year without getting hurt. As the years passed, the repetitive work led him to suffer from shoulder injuries, arthritis and a later, he retired after breaking his shoulder in a fall, Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n  Although his father took pride in his work, he never wanted his son to follow the same path “because he understood how difficult that job was on the body,” Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n    Remote state prison transformed to hold immigrants\n \n\n   \n  The terracotta-colored building in McCook, Nebraska, soon to be referred as “Cornhusker Clink” was previously a state prison known as the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services’ Work Ethic Camp.\n \n\n   \n  With a focus on reintegrating low-risk offenders back into the community, the camp housed more than 180 inmates who often worked on-site at the facility’s kitchen or warehouse, according to a 2024  report.  Others filled road-crew jobs with the Nebraska Department of Transportation.\n \n\n   \n  The facility, opened since 2001, aimed to ease prison overcrowding “and make prison bed space available for violent offenders.” Decades later, the Nebraska prison system is still struggling to manage its current population, which is exceeding 140% of its design capacity, according to a  2024 report  by the state’s inspector general of the correctional system.\n \n\n   \n  Repurposing the facility in McCook is expected to further destabilize the prison system, said Mindy Chipman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska.\n \n\n   \n  “Transitioning a minimum-security facility that provides reentry services — services the Department of Corrections says are more needed than ever — into an immigration detention center removes support from Nebraskans and confines people, most of whom have no criminal record,” Chipman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Current prisoners will be discharged, placed on parole or transferred to other correctional facilities “by the time the facility is ready to house ICE detainees,” the governor’s office said in a  September news release .\n \n\n   \n  When the converted ICE detention center opens, state officials said, people with minor criminal records and nonviolent felonies will be eligible to be placed there but not those with felony convictions linked to acts of violence.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the governor’s office, the department of corrections and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s motive is not safety, according to Chipman, but rather to signal support for Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. The “Cornhusker Clink” is one of several new detention projects backed by the Trump administration’s $45 billion “ One Big Beautiful Bill ,” which would add 80,000 ICE beds nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the overcrowding, legal advocates in Nebraska said they worry the facility’s remote location could increase the likelihood of detainees experiencing civil rights violations, with many being far from family and attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  McCook is one of several small communities in southwestern Nebraska and sits somewhat close to Interstate 80, a major highway that travels east to Omaha – about four hours away – and west toward Denver – three hours away.\n \n\n   \n  There is no public bus from Omaha, the most populous city in the state, to McCook as well as to North Platte, a rural town about an hour north of it where most of the immigrants detained following the raid at the meatpacking plant in June were taken. All travel must be done by car, which could become tricky during the harsh Nebraska winters.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s easier to get to North Platte because it’s on I-80. McCook, you have to go further, and you are more in the middle of nowhere,” said Lina Traslaviña Stover, executive director of the Omaha-based nonprofit Heartland Workers Group, whose work involves advocating for migrants who are detained at immigration detention facilities in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “Isolation is part of the strategy,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Anne Wruth, an attorney with the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, who traveled west to meet with a detained client in North Platte, called the process a “logistical nightmare.”\n \n\n   \n  For lawmakers and advocates, who said they were surprised when plans for the ICE facility were announced, there are other pressing needs such as property taxes, labor shortage and affordable housing in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This was not something that went through us,” Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature whose district includes part of Omaha, said about state lawmakers and plans for the facility, noting the timeline was “extremely truncated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘And if anything happens, you go’\n \n\n   \n  Alejandra is realizing the state she and her parents have called home and instantly made them feel welcome – where many still say “please” and “thank you” – has started to turn against them, or at least some people.\n \n\n   \n  When the family first arrived in Nebraska, Alejandra excelled in school where she was surrounded by classmates from Thailand, Haiti, and El Salvador – a diversity fueled in part by the state’s refugee resettlement program, which welcomes the most refugees per capita compared to other US states despite Nebraska’s relatively small population of just over 2 million people, according to a  data analysis  from the Immigration Research Initiative, a non-profit, non-partisan think tank tracking immigrant data.\n \n\n   \n  “It was awesome. I saw so many different races and nationalities — I wasn’t the only one,” Alejandra said. “Compared to Iowa, I wasn’t highlighted as ‘she is not from here.’”\n \n\n   \n  Her parents, who are also undocumented, own a home and pay taxes. They’ve seen their children and grandchildren grow up and enjoyed taking them to the park or baseball games.\n \n\n   \n  With animosity toward immigrants on the rise in the US and Nebraska, Alejandra says her parents will soon leave the country as they plan to self-deport to Mexico in six months. They are afraid to be detained and worry the conditions at ICE facilities could jeopardize her mother’s fragile health.\n \n\n   \n  “They do not like living in fear,” Alejandra said.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not immune to that fear, and neither are her children. In recent weeks, Alejandra gave her 13-year-old son instructions on what to do if anything were to happen to her as they drove to the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  “’Mom, you stay in the car and I’ll go inside. I’ll get everything that we need. And if anything happens, you go, but you drive away,’” Alejandra recalled her son telling her. “I know who to call.”\n \n\n   \n  As she looks towards the future, Alejandra wonders what kind of future awaits her young sons, especially if the Nebraska she knows continues to transform and align with Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric. Like her parents, Alejandra says she may be forced to leave the state, and everything she knows, in exchange for a stable and happy life.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/china/china-sends-youngest-astronaut-to-space-station-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:03:00-04:00","title":"China Sends Its Youngest Astronaut and Four Black Mice to ‘Heavenly Palace’ Space Station","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China launched the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, carrying the youngest astronauts in its corps—Zhang Hongzhang and Wu Fei—as part of its seventh crewed mission to the permanently inhabited Tiangong space station.

After the first boat strike in September, for example, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the vessel had likely been headed toward Trinidad and Tobago.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is also not known to be a major source of cocaine for the US market, but the Trump administration has been aggressively trying to link Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to the drug trade while accumulating a huge military presence near Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “At the direction of the President, the Department of War is taking the fight to the cartels and defending our Homeland from Designated Terrorist Organization’s illicit activities before their violence and poison reaches our shores – this includes all of our nation’s borders,” a Pentagon official told CNN. “The Department’s newly established counter-narcotics Joint Task Force is expanding efforts on both the East and West Coasts to counter illicit drug trafficking by narco-terrorists using maritime routes.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not provided Congress with evidence to back up its claims that the 15 vessels the military has struck since September in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 61 people, were ferrying drugs and carrying known drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  During a classified briefing on Capitol Hill this week, Pentagon officials also told lawmakers they do not know how to gauge success in the ongoing military campaign, according to a source familiar with the closed-door session.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t know whether there’s any data or metrics that would show (the strikes are) impeding the flow of drugs, whether there has been an increase in the price due to higher demand or lower supply, like there’s just no information,” the source said. “None of the briefers could say what they’re going to do when the traffickers change their tactics. None of them could say how they’re addressing air and land routes.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs said following the briefing on Thursday that administration officials confirmed that they do not necessarily know the individual identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it.\n \n\n   \n  “They said that they do not need to positively identify individuals on the vessel to do the strikes,” Jacobs said, adding that the administration did not want to detain or try survivors in court, “because they could not satisfy the evidentiary burden.” The US military briefly held and then repatriated two survivors of one of its strikes earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials also told lawmakers on Thursday that the strikes were targeting cocaine, not fentanyl.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump told a collection of senior military brass assembled during an  unusual event in Virginia last month  that the strikes were primarily targeting fentanyl transporting ships.\n \n\n   \n  “These boats, they’re stacked up with bags of white powder, that’s mostly fentanyl and other drugs too,” he said. “Every boat kills 25,000.”\n \n\n   \n  Fentanyl killed more than double the number of Americans than cocaine did in 2023, according to  US government data . By Trump’s math, the campaign against alleged drug boats thus far should prevent roughly 375,000 deaths, or slightly more than the total population of Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Jacobs said the briefers insisted that cocaine is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl but it was not a satisfactory answer for most of us.”\n \n\n   \n  “None of them could say what they’re doing for fentanyl,” said the source familiar with the briefing. “Fentanyl is the real problem here, and they’re actually not addressing fentanyl in any of these operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats and Republicans also want a better explanation of the legal justification for the strikes, but military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings. The legal counsel to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was supposed to brief lawmakers on Thursday but pulled out after it became clear that lawyers from the defense secretary’s office were given a “pass” at attending, sources told CNN. Without the lawyers there, Democrats said the briefers could not fully answer their questions about the legality of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t even show up with the lawyers,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts said after the briefing. “They canceled at the last minute.”\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth told reporters on Friday while traveling in Asia that he had engaged with Congress on a bipartisan basis about the strikes. But also on Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said.\n \n\n   \n  The letters requested the execute orders for the US military strikes on the boats, and the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that CNN has reported the administration is leaning on to legally justify the strikes. Some Republican senators were shown the OLC memo by administration officials during a briefing on Wednesday, infuriating Democrats who were not invited to the briefing and have still not seen document.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner called the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/middleeast/turkey-ski-resort-fire-sentence-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00-04:00","title":"Turkish court sentences hotel owner and 10 others to life for deadly fire that killed 78","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Turkish court sentenced hotel owner Halit Ergul and 10 others to life in prison for severe negligence in connection with a deadly fire at the Grand Kartal Hotel in Bolu, Turkey, on January 21, 2025.

But experts broadly emphasize the safety and benefits of fluoride.\n \n\n   \n  Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth.\n \n\n   \n  The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way. The CDC named fluoridation of drinking water  one of the 10 greatest health interventions in America  in the 20th century alongside vaccination, family planning and safer workplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Most US residents live in a community where fluoride is added to public drinking water, according to  federal data  from 2022. In places where fluoride is not in the water, fluoride tablets or drops may be prescribed for babies and children to reduce the risk of tooth decay — and reliance on fluoride supplements could become more common, as Utah and Florida became the first states to  ban the practice  of adding fluoride to drinking water and similar legislation has been introduced in several other states.\n \n\n   \n  In April, the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Environmental Protection Agency Administration  announced  that they would study the science to make a new recommendation on fluoride. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said he will tell the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation for drinking water in communities.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA launched a ”safety review and public comment period” on the issue in ​May,   ﻿and a  strategy report  from the MAHA Commission – with an agenda spearheaded by Kennedy – specifically named fluoride supplements as an issue to investigate, along with vaccine injuries and exposures to pesticides and microplastics.\n \n\n   \n  In the resulting  scientific evaluation , published Friday, the agency concluded that fluoride supplements “should not be used in children under age 3 or by older children who are not at high risk of tooth decay.”\n \n\n   \n  “For the same reason fluoride may work to kill bacteria on teeth, it may also alter the gut microbiome, which may have broader health implications,” the agency said in a news release.\n \n\n   \n  “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome. The microbiome is increasingly recognized to be central to a child’s health and development,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in the release.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA on Friday also referenced “preliminary but potentially concerning” data about the risks that fluoride can have for children’s intellectual development. A  meta-analysis published earlier this year , which would become the basis for further federal investigation, concluded that IQ drops as fluoride levels rise. But some experts have raised concerns about biases in the analysis and emphasized that it focused on levels of fluoride that are far higher than most people are exposed to.\n \n\n   \n  As water fluoridation starts to roll back in some communities, experts say that protecting the option to use prescription supplements is key. In fact, the legislation in Utah that banned the addition of fluoride to the public drinking water included provisions to expand access to prescription fluoride — and  prescriptions spiked  after the change.\n \n\n   \n  For some oral health advocates, the latest action from the FDA is a win simply because it is not an outright ban.\n \n\n   \n  “We are actually quite pleased about this decision, because fluoride supplements remain available and will continue to be a benefit to oral health,” said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist from Utah who spoke at public meeting to discuss the risks and benefits of the prescription fluoride supplements in July.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel that the decision of the FDA to continue making fluoride supplements available is an indication that all of the input generated from health professionals was heard and considered in their decision,” Bekker said in an email to CNN on Friday. “Providers can prescribe according to their consultation with parents and patients at recommended levels. We still recommend starting fluoride supplements at age 6 months in non-fluoridated water communities and will rely on knowledgeable health professionals to follow the documented science as they consider appropriate ages and dosages.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/jeffrey-epstein-financial-records-unsealed-jp-morgan","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:16:00-04:00","title":"Newly Unsealed Epstein Records Shed Light on Years of His Financial Transactions with Wall Street Figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Newly unsealed court records reveal that JPMorgan Chase filed over 100 suspicious activity reports (SARs) from 2002 to 2019 regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s financial transactions, totaling over $1 billion with Wall Street figures, including Leon Black, and Russian banks such as Alfa Bank and Sberbank.

figures \n       \n  By Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:16 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One month after  Jeffrey Epstein  died in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, JPMorgan Chase   reported to   US authorities of more than one billion dollars in transactions it viewed as suspicious, according to newly unsealed court records.\n \n\n   \n  The notification was made on September 26, 2019, in a suspicious activity report, which is a kind of confidential report financial institutions file with the Treasury Department to flag potentially nefarious activity.\n \n\n   \n  JPMorgan’s report highlights over $1 billion in transactions Epstein engaged in from October 2003 until July 2019 with numerous related companies, Wall Street titans, his former lawyer and others. Two accounts included in the report were linked to Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank.\n \n\n   \n  The bank wrote in the SAR it was flagging the transactions because of negative media about Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking of minors, media reports of allegations Epstein misappropriating money as an investment adviser, his use of multiple accounts, the Russian banks, and his relationships with two US presidents.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged with sex trafficking underaged girls. He died weeks later by suicide in the Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Jed Rakoff ordered the unsealing of the records, which were part of a lawsuit between the US Virgin Islands and JPMorgan Chase, following requests by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal. In 2023, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit from survivors of Epstein and an additional $75 million to settle with USVI, where Epstein owned an island. There was no admission of wrongdoing in these settlements.\n \n\n   \n  The documents are the latest in a slow release of materials tied to Epstein as public demand for accountability and transparency about Epstein has gone global. Thursday, Britain’s King Charles took the extraordinary step of stripping his brother Andrew of his prince title. The Justice Department remains under pressure to release more information about its investigation into Epstein, and House lawmakers are taking depositions for their investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Included in the hundreds of pages of unsealed documents are emails between Epstein and Jes Staley, a former top official at JPMorgan bank, who in 2021 resigned as head of Barclays bank following media scrutiny over his long relationship with Epstein. This year, Staley  said  he didn’t know about Epstein’s involvement with underaged girls but admitted in court that he had sex with one of Epstein’s assistants.\n \n\n   \n  Among the pages are emails between Epstein and Staley, with Epstein suggesting he could set up meetings for Staley to recruit new clients including the co-founders of Google and heads of nations.  None of the individuals were accused of any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Epstein’s death in 2019, JPMorgan filed a number of SARs involving the disgraced financier’s accounts, and the documents show banking officials shared news articles about Epstein’s alleged activities. JPMorgan closed its accounts with Epstein in 2013, five years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and reached a non-prosecution agreement with the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida.\n \n\n   \n  The newly unsealed records include the SARs, including one dating as far back as 2002, as well as the last one filed in September 2019.\n \n\n   \n  “Generally, the only new material here is the SARs themselves. Those basically summarize financial information produced in litigation, much of which has been public for years. The SARs do confirm what’s been inferred all along: the bank filed SARs about Epstein early on, and specifically when it exited Epstein from the bank in 2013 – and repeatedly between 2013 and 2019, as required,” said Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase.   “It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years.”\n \n\n   \n  In the batch of documents, there’s a letter from the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida which in 2007 sought records from Bear Stearns, one of Epstein’s banks that was later acquired by JPMorgan, as part of its then investigation into Epstein that resulted in the non-prosecution agreement.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest Wall Street names mentioned on the list of transactions on the 2019 SAR is Leon Black, a long-time associate of Epstein, who has maintained that Epstein gave him financial advice.\n \n\n   \n  “After an exhaustive investigation more than four years ago, the Dechert law firm concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein only for tax and estate planning advice that saved him and his family billions of dollars. To imply that Epstein somehow had influence over Mr. Black is false and patently absurd,” Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, said in a statement. “Indeed, it was Mr. Black who fired Epstein because he was disruptive and believed the fees for his services were excessive. The Dechert Report also found that Mr. Black had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.”\n \n\n   \n  The unsealed records include emails between Staley and Epstein about meeting in 2010 with then Prince Andrew. The then-Prince emailed Staley, “Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, has asked JPMorgan for banking records and suggested officials turned a blind eye to Epstein’s conduct to make millions of dollars in fees from his accounts.\n \n\n   \n  In a recent response, the bank denied knowledge of Epstein’s activities, writing, “with the exception of former JPMC executive Jes Staley, the bank’s executives (current and former) are respected professionals who acted with integrity and would never have allowed Epstein to remain a client if they knew of his ongoing crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Firm deeply regrets having had Epstein as a client and would never have continued doing business with him if it believed he engaged in ongoing criminal conduct,” the bank also said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/brother-virginia-giuffre-king-charles-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"Brother of Virginia Giuffre Calls for Meeting with King Charles to Shed Light on Epstein Case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The brother of Virginia Giuffre, Sky Roberts, has called for a meeting with King Charles III to share survivor testimonies and urge the royal family to use its influence in uncovering more information about Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking network.

So, if he asked me to come meet with him, I’d be in London tomorrow,” Sky Roberts told CNN in an interview on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  His comments come after the King took the extraordinary decision to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy this week amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re actually getting some acknowledgement from the King and saying he stands with survivors,” Roberts said, adding that the King’s response had been more positive than that of US authorities. “I think we should take a moment of appreciation for that but also call to action – to take it that next step further into an investigation, and to expedite that.”\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace declined to comment when asked about the idea of a meeting with Giuffre’s family.\n \n\n   \n  The statement released by Buckingham Palace on Thursday, which announced that Andrew would be  stripped of his titles  and honors, also said: “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, accused  the King’s brother Andrew  of sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager.

That needs to be released fully,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he would be willing to meet with Andrew as well as King Charles, Roberts said: “I don’t think there’s anything Andrew can say except for A) an extreme apology to my sister, and B) if he’s ready to come forward and actually give some sort of light to what has transpired in that inner circle” with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  An expedited process of justice against Andrew would also involve “getting him out of his house,” Roberts said, addressing reports that the former prince will remain at the Royal Lodge in Windsor until after the holidays. “I think it shouldn’t be until Christmas. It should be tomorrow.”\n \n\n   \n  Roberts also said the United Kingdom should “find another loophole” to ensure that Andrew’s status as eighth in line to the throne is also removed. “Who cares if it takes a little bit more time and an Act of Parliament – then do it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/michigan-potential-terrorist-attack-averted-fbi","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:03:00Z","title":"FBI Averts Potential ISIS-Inspired Terror Attack in Michigan Over Halloween Weekend","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI thwarted a potential ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in Michigan by detecting suspicious online chatter involving plans for a violent Halloween-related plot.

That’s when investigators jumped into action.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple people were arrested Friday when the FBI averted a possible terrorist attack planned for Halloween weekend, Director Kash Patel said.\n \n\n   \n  “This morning the FBI thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.

But Trump also said two things about his popularity that are not even close to true.\n \n\n   \n  He said, “I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had.” And he said, “I have the best numbers for any president in many years – any president.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s approval is down markedly from his second-term peak\n \n\n   \n  In reality, polls show that Americans’ approval of Trump has declined significantly since the beginning of his second term in late January. Multiple polling averages confirm that Trump’s poll numbers are nowhere in the ballpark of their highest-ever levels.\n \n\n   \n   A New York Times average  put Trump’s net approval at negative-11 points as of Tuesday: 43% approval and 54% disapproval. That is down a  net 20 points  from the first week of the term, when Trump was at positive-9 points – 52% approval and 43% disapproval.  CNN’s Poll of Polls  average, updated Wednesday, has Trump’s net approval at negative-15 points (41% approval and 56% disapproval), down a net 14 points from our first average of the term in early February.\n \n\n   \n  Other polling averages also show large drops in Trump’s standing since the beginning of the term.\n \n\n   \n  An  average produced by G. Elliott Morris , co-founder of the polling data website  FiftyPlusOne.news , put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-14 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 26 points from the first days of the term. An  average produced by data journalist Nate Silver  put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-10 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 22 points from the first days of the term.\n \n\n   \n  The White House didn’t respond to a CNN request for comment for this article.\n \n\n   \n  It’s worth noting that Trump does continue to have  extremely high   approval   among Republicans , often in the vicinity of 90%. But he never said Tuesday that he was talking about his popularity with his own party rather than the country as a whole, and he is not at a personal record high even among Republicans in particular.\n \n\n   \n    Many other presidents had far better numbers\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current poll numbers are nowhere close to “the best numbers for any president in many years,” even if you ignore the fact that they’re not even his own best numbers in many years.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current low standing – a negative net approval, with approval specifically in the low-40s – clearly does not approach the  approval  peaks   of recent predecessors. President Barack Obama hit 69% approval in the early days of his first term, according to tracking by polling firm Gallup, while President George W. Bush hit 90% approval in the wake of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Even President Joe Biden, who struggled with weak poll numbers for much of his term, was up at 57% approval in both January 2021 and April 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s claim is also wrong even if he was referring specifically to other presidents’ poll numbers on the same date of a term.\n \n\n   \n  Biden had low net approval on the equivalent day of his term, but it was still better than Trump’s in both  Morris’s average  and  Silver’s average . And Trump’s boast about beating “any president in many years” clearly suggested he was comparing himself to other presidents in addition to Biden; the data shows that  every other person elected president after World War II  had better poll numbers than Trump on the equivalent date in their ​first term, in both net approval and approval alone.\n \n\n   \n  Silver’s  historical tracking  shows that, on the date Trump made this claim while having a roughly negative-10 net approval, Obama had about a positive-9 net approval in his first term, George W. Bush about positive-76, President Bill Clinton positive-2, President George H.W. Bush about positive-38, President Ronald Reagan about positive-20, President Jimmy Carter about positive-24, President Richard Nixon about positive-27, President John F. Kennedy about positive-65, President Dwight D. Eisenhower about positive-45, and President Harry Truman about positive-41.\n \n\n   \n  It would be fair to point out that Trump is serving a (non-consecutive) second term rather than a first term. But that added context doesn’t make Trump’s assertion correct. Gallup, which  assessed presidential approval on a quarter-by-quarter basis , found that, other than Nixon, Trump had a lower average approval in his 19th quarter as president – the third quarter of the second term, running from July 20 through October 19 – than any president elected to two terms from at least Eisenhower in the 1950s onward.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/world/un-human-rights-chief-drug-boats-strikes-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:11:00-04:00","title":"UN Human Rights Chief Says US Strikes on Alleged Drug Boats Are 'Unacceptable'","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has condemned U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, which are alleged to carry drugs from South America, calling them 'unacceptable' and violating international human rights law.

UN human rights chief said Friday that US  military strikes  against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.\n \n\n   \n  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,  Volker Türk , called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organization.\n \n\n   \n  Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk’s office, relayed his message Friday at a regular UN briefing: “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.”\n \n\n   \n  She said Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.”\n \n\n   \n  US President  Donald Trump  has justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes and the US military’s growing presence near Venezuela have stoked fears that the Trump administration could  try to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Friday if he’s considering land strikes in Venezuela,  Trump said, “No.”  He did not elaborate as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as he heads to Florida for the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking earlier this week from the USS George Washington aircraft carrier in Japan, Trump noted the US attacks at sea and reiterated that “now we’ll stop the drugs coming in by land.”\n \n\n   \n  US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest US military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.\n \n\n   \n  Shamdasani noted the US explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counterterrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.\n \n\n   \n  Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life,” she said. “Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.”\n \n\n   \n  The strikes are taking place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/white-house-lincoln-bedroom-bathroom-renovation","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00Z","title":"Trump reveals renovated Lincoln Bedroom bathroom as his White House remodel continues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced the renovation of the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom in the White House, replacing 1940s Art Deco green tile with black and white polished statuary marble, claiming it is historically appropriate for Abraham Lincoln's time.

\nUpdated: \n        4:26 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he has renovated the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom, sharing before and after images on social media as he continues to put his touch on the  White House .\n \n\n   \n  “I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump said on Truth Social. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n \n\n   \n  The president posted about the renovations aboard Air Force One en route to Florida, where he will spend the weekend. The post comes as the government remains shutdown, and the Trump administration says it will not tap into emergency funds to fund SNAP food assistance benefits through the month of November.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, Trump posted more images of the bathroom, showing gold detailing on the faucet and shower handle, as well as other fixtures. A plush white robe with presidential seal also hangs on a golden hook.\n \n\n   \n  The president discussed the changes he was making to the bathroom earlier this month during a dinner at the White House, saying in part that the old style of the bathroom “was not exactly Abe Lincoln.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have little things like at the Lincoln Bedroom. The bathroom was done by the Truman family and you know, long time ago. And it’s done in a green tile, and it’s done in a style that was not exactly Abe Lincoln,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s actually Art Deco. And Art Deco doesn’t go with, you know, 1850 and Civil Wars…But what does do is statuary marble. So I ripped it apart and we built a bathroom. It’s absolutely gorgeous and totally in keeping with that time because the Lincoln bedroom is, uh, so incredible, for those of you that have seen it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Friday also gave a status update on a separate construction project he’s overseeing at the Kennedy Center, which he said he “just inspected.”\n \n\n   \n  “The exterior columns, which were in serious danger of corrosion if something weren’t done, are completed, and look magnificent in White Enamel — Like a different place! Marble is being done, stages are being renovated, new seats, new chairs, and new fabrics will soon be installed, and magnificent high end carpeting throughout the building. It is happening faster than anticipated, one of my trademarks,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are bringing this building back to life. It was dead as a doornail, but it will soon be beautiful again!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The moves are part of Trump’s effort to put his stamp on the White House – which has seen a slew of changes since he took office – and the greater DC area.\n \n\n   \n   So far, the renovations include paving over the grass in the historic Rose Garden, demolishing the East Wing to make way for a new ballroom and adorning the Oval Office with gold.\n \n\n   \n  Trump often says the White House needed a new ballroom to host world leaders, to avoid situations where they are outside and a temporary tent has to be used when it rains. And he frequently remarked that the Rose Garden paving was necessary, because women in high heels would sink into the grass during events. It now has a touch of Mar-a-Lago with the same white and yellow umbrellas at tables on the patio.\n \n\n   \n  His  redecoration  of the Oval Office to his liking, as presidents do when they take office, has tripled the number of paintings on the walls with gold just about everywhere. Trump also installed portraits of every president framed in gold on the West Colonnade – except for former President Joe Biden who is instead represented by his autopen signature – and large floor-to-ceiling mirrors, which press can see when they are escorted into the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to those changes, Trump plans to build a  new arch monument  in DC in honor of the country’s 250th anniversary.\n \n\n   \n  As he pushes forward with his plans to leave his mark on the White House and the nation’s capital, Trump this week  fired the members  of the Commission of Fine Arts. The independent federal agency is charged with advising the president, Congress and the city of Washington, DC, on “matters of design and aesthetics.” The president has also installed allies on the National Capital Planning Commission, which will be tasked with approving plans for the new ballroom on White House grounds.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/government-shutdown-billions-federal-aid-dries-up","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:59:00Z","title":"‘I feel guilty eating a meal’: Low-income families prepare to lose access to billions in federal aid","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown nears its one-month mark, millions of low-income Americans face severe hardships due to the suspension of key federal aid programs.

 By Isabelle Khurshudyan, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:59 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Annemarie King is eating only once a day, and her husband, Randall, is picking up extra shifts at the drywall factory where he works. They are among the nearly 42 million Americans preparing for their food stamp benefits to run dry in November because of the ongoing  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The Kings, who live in Cincinnati and have eight young children, depend on the roughly $1,000 in food stamps that they receive at the start of every month to stock their refrigerator with fresh fruits, vegetables and meat.\n \n\n   \n  But since the US Department of Agriculture  announced in mid-October  that it doesn’t have the funding to provide next month’s benefits during the government shutdown, Annemarie, a stay-at-home mother, has been buying more canned and boxed items and preparing less for dinner.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also going without food herself. Her 11-year-old son has noticed, she said, but she tells him not to worry and that she ate while he was at school.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel guilty eating a meal,” Annemarie said. “I don’t want to take food away from them.”\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown nears the one-month mark, it’s not just furloughed federal workers feeling the financial strain. Low-income households across the country will lose access to  key social safety net programs  in the coming days as billions of dollars in federal funding dries up.\n \n\n   \n  Beginning November 1, more than 65,000 children and families could lose access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources, according to the National Head Start Association. For some parents, that means they might have to quit their jobs because they won’t have child care anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Others are worried they might not get heat subsidies from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program before the winter months. On top of that, roughly 24 million Americans who receive health insurance through the Affordable Care Act are preparing for what is likely to be a  significant increase  in premiums next year.\n \n\n   \n  In interviews with people in cities across the country, the early implications of the stop in federal funding for low-income families are starting to come into focus. Food banks and other charities are expecting higher demand, as millions face increasingly desperate situations without the programs they rely on.\n \n\n   \n  At the Kings’ household, the loss of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, means that instead of serving chicken, a fresh vegetable and either mashed potatoes or macaroni and cheese, Annemarie has been cooking chicken and canned green beans. Chilis, pastas and roasts are on the menu more often since they can last for a few days.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family is suffering because neither side will compromise,” Annemarie said of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.  “It’s no longer a Democrat thing, it’s no longer a Republican thing. It’s our lives.”\n \n\n   \n  The status of SNAP funding for November is currently uncertain, however. A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight between Democratic-led states and the Trump administration over its US Department of Agriculture’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to provide benefits next month.\n \n\n   \n  However the judge rules, millions of Americans will not receive their food stamp benefits on time. An estimated 3 million people will be affected on November 1 alone, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n   Food pantries  around the country are preparing for a surge in demand next week if people don’t receive their SNAP stipends. But food bank directors have warned that they can provide only a fraction of the meals that are supplied by federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  And for some households, the loss of more than one of these programs has a compounding effect.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, Ohio – about an hour outside Cincinnati – the closure of the local Head Start program means Lauren Lowe, 42, will likely have to quit her job as a restaurant server. She and her husband were able to both work full time while their 4-year-old son, Carter, attended Head Start on weekdays.\n \n\n   \n  He and 176 other kids got meals and health care there. And he loved his friends and teachers, Lowe said. Since she’s had to tell him that this will be his last week in the program, Carter is “broken-hearted right now. He’s crying every single morning because he wants to be in school with his friends,” Lowe said.\n \n\n   \n  Lowe is feeling uneasy, too. Quitting her job means less income for the household – in addition to missing their food stamp benefits. \n \n\n   \n  “It’s really scary because, how do we make ends meet?” Lowe said. “I either stay home and school my child or figure out how we’re going to pay the bills to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowe will also have to replace the two meals Carter was getting every day he was at Head Start.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday mornings, kids do come in hungrier than usual, so we know they’re really dependent on that breakfast, lunch and snack we give them,” said Julia Wise, the executive director of the Highland County Community Action Organization, which runs the Hillsboro Head Start program. \n \n\n   \n  Wise said 45 Head Start staff will be furloughed on Monday. Other Head Start programs — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit.\n \n\n   \n  In the Kansas City area, 17 programs with grants expiring on November 1 decided to take a “financial risk” by staying open, said Kasey Lawson, the Head Start director for the Mid-America Regional Council. The providers do not know if they will be reimbursed later when the new grant year is funded.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, teachers prepared homework packets that will take the kids through the end of November, so they can keep studying even when the program is closed. Some of that staff will likely   get other jobs before the government shutdown ends, meaning whenever Head Start does get funding again, it might not have enough educators to reopen all its classrooms, Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  For those who can’t find other work, “they’re going on furlough, they’re not going to have money coming in, so they could apply for SNAP benefits, but now SNAP is not going to be available either,” Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  “This is impacting us across the board,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  In rural Oregon, where the temperatures are already dipping below the freezing mark, the suspension of funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, is putting lives at risk, said Sheri Gutierrez, energy program manager at Community Action Program of East Central Oregon, a nonprofit that provides a range of services for residents in need.\n \n\n   \n  The $4 billion program, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start; the aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December.\n \n\n   \n  But barely a month into the season, Community Action in Oregon already has more than $200,000 in grant payments that are on hold until the government reopens. Many of its clients heat their homes with propane, wood and heating oil, and they don’t enjoy the same continuous service and shutoff protections available to many people who use electricity and natural gas to stay warm.\n \n\n   \n  The delay has worried local residents, some of whom are using old space heaters or their ovens, which Gutierrez says aren’t safe.\n \n\n   \n  “We hear the desperation when speaking to these clients on a daily basis. People want reassurance that they will get assistance,” she said. “LIHEAP is lifesaving. Without heat, they won’t survive.”\n \n\n   \n  In Lakeville, Minnesota, Ronda Beck is also waiting for help from LIHEAP to cover the electric bill. After speaking with her utility company “at great length,” Beck was told she could pay whatever she can until her grant is funded and she won’t be disconnected. But she’s not sure how she’ll scrape together a couple of bucks since she’s not working.\n \n\n   \n  “Where do I get $5 from?” She said. “It’s a tough situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Beck figured she could survive on groceries she picks up from her local food pantries if she and her adult son stop receiving food stamps next month – that is until she found out on Tuesday that one of the groups is only providing two or three days of food, instead two weeks’ worth. Now, she’s terrified.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to go hungry,” said Beck, who along with her son is looking for jobs in Lakeville, Minnesota, where they live. “I don’t want to walk into [a food pantry] and have them say, ‘We’re at our limit’.”\n \n\n   \n  Just outside Washington DC, Willissa Bullock worries about her food bank running out, as it’s dealing with a surge in demand from furloughed federal workers in the area. When the Landover, Maryland, resident heard that the USDA would not issue benefits next month, Bullock says she cried – nervous about how she would provide for her kids, who are in college.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Bullock left a local food pantry run by No Limits Outreach Ministries with only enough items – including lettuce, apple juice, and canned goods – to last two or three days. Until recently, her shopping cart would be overflowing.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m telling the kids to look for jobs,” said Bullock, who is unemployed and applying for disability after having back surgery. “It’s the only way we’ll be able to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  The food pantry has been receiving fewer shipments from Capital Area Food Bank after two  Covid 19-era relief programs  were canceled earlier this year. The pantry used to be able to offer meat, fish, eggs and milk to its clients, but now it mostly has beans, rice and canned foods, said Oliver Carter, pastor of No Limits Outreach Ministries.\n \n\n   \n  “Our storage used to be full and now it’s almost empty,” Carter said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/ohio-republicans-redistricting-map","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:32:00Z","title":"Ohio Panel and Virginia Lawmakers Move Forward with Congressional Redistricting Plans","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Republican-dominated Ohio redistricting commission adopted new congressional maps to strengthen Republican chances in the 2026 elections, particularly in competitive districts like those of Greg Landsman and Marcy Kaptur.

The Senate on Friday passed a resolution that would allow lawmakers to temporarily bypass a bipartisan redistricting commission and gerrymander their maps. The House had advanced it Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been urging Republican-led states to reshape their US House districts in an attempt to win more seats. But unlike in other states, Ohio’s redistricting was required by the state constitution because the current districts were adopted after the 2020 census without bipartisan support.\n \n\n   \n  Ohio joins Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers already have revised their congressional districts.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have been pushing back. California voters are deciding Tuesday on a redistricting plan passed by the Democratic-led legislature.\n \n\n   \n  The political parties are in an intense battle. Democrats need to gain just three seats in next year’s election to win control of the House and gain the power to impede Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, Republicans already hold 10 of 15 congressional seats. The new map could boost Republican chances in already competitive districts currently held by Democratic Reps. Greg Landsman in Cincinnati and Marcy Kaptur near Toledo. Kaptur won a 22nd term last year by about 2,400 votes, or less than 1 percentage point, in a district carried by Trump. Landsman was reelected with more than 54% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n    Ohio residents criticize new map\n \n\n   \n  Ohio’s commission had faced a Friday deadline to adopt a new map, or else the task would have fallen to the GOP-led legislature, which could have crafted districts even more favorable to Republicans. But any redistricting bill passed by the legislature could have been subject to an initiative petition campaign from opponents seeking to force a public referendum on the new map.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of that legislative process provided commissioners of both parties with some incentive for compromise. All seven commissioners — five Republicans and two Democrats — voted for the new map.\n \n\n   \n  But Ohio residents who testified to commissioners Friday denounced the new districts. Julia Cattaneo, who wore a shirt saying “gerrymandering is cheating,” said the new map is gerrymandered more for Republicans than the one it is replacing and is not the sort of compromise needed.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, you are compromising — your integrity, honor, duty and to represent Ohioans,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Added resident Scott Sibley: “This map is an affront to democracy, and you should all — every one of you — be ashamed.”\n \n\n   \n  Republican state Auditor Keith Farber, a member of the commission, defended the map during a testy exchange with one opponent. Because many Democrats live in cities and many Republicans in rural areas, he said there was no way to draw a map creating eight Republican and seven Democratic districts — as some had urged — without splitting cities, counties and townships.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia Democrats point at Trump to defend redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Virginia is represented in the US House by six Democrats and five Republicans. Democratic lawmakers haven’t unveiled their planned new map, nor how many seats they are trying to gain, but said their moves are necessary to respond to the Trump-inspired gerrymandering in Republican-led states.\n \n\n   \n  “Our voters are asking to have that voice. They’re asking that we protect democracy, that we not allow gerrymandering to happen throughout the country, and we sit back,” said Democratic Sen. Barbara Favola.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed constitutional amendment would let lawmakers temporarily bypass a bipartisan commission and redraw congressional districts to their advantage. The measure would still need to pass the General Assembly again next year, then go before voters in a statewide referendum.\n \n\n   \n  The developments come as Virginia holds statewide elections Tuesday, where all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are on the ballot. Democrats would need to keep their slim majority in the lower chamber to advance the constitutional amendment next year.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Mark Obenshain said Democrats were ignoring the will of voters who had overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan redistricting commission.\n \n\n   \n  “Heaven forbid that we actually link arms and work together on something,” Obenshain said. “What the voters of Virginia said is, ‘We expect redistricting to be an issue that we work across the aisle on, that we link arms on.’”\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, who has long championed the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission, noted the panel still would be in charge of redistricting after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not trying to end the practice of fair maps,” he said. “We are asking the voters if, in this one limited case, they want to ensure that a constitutional-norm-busting president can’t break the entire national election by twisting the arms of a few state legislatures.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/state-medicaid-undocumented-immigrants-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:22:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s HHS Orders State Medicaid Programs to Help Find Undocumented Immigrants","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), directed state Medicaid programs to verify the immigration status of enrolled individuals, resulting in over 170,000 names being reviewed across five states and Washington, D.C.

But the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz, said in a post on the social platform X on Oct. 31 that more than $1 billion “of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants” in five states and Washington, D.C.\n \n\n   \n  Medicaid’s overall spending topped $900 billion in fiscal year 2024.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t clear from Oz’s statement or an accompanying video over what period the spending happened, and CMS spokespeople did not immediately respond to questions, either for an earlier version of this article or after Oz’s statement was posted.\n \n\n   \n  Only U.S. citizens and some lawfully present immigrants are eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income and disabled people, and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program. Those without legal status are ineligible for federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, and plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  At least one state said it disagreed with Oz’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Our payments for coverage of undocumented individuals are in accordance with state and federal laws,” said Marc Williams, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Department of Health Care Policy & Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program. “The $1.5 million number referenced by federal leaders today is based on an incorrect preliminary finding, and has been refuted with supporting data by our Department experts.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “It is disappointing that the administration is announcing this number as final when it is clearly overstated and the conversations are very much in the education and discussion phase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, CMS began sending states the names of people enrolled in Medicaid that the agency suspected might not be eligible, demanding state Medicaid agencies check their immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News in October reached out to Medicaid agencies in 10 states. Five provided the approximate number of names they had received from the Trump administration, with expectations of more to come: Colorado had been given about 45,000 names, Ohio 61,000, Pennsylvania 34,000, Texas 28,000, and Utah 8,000. More than 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  Most of those states declined to comment further. Medicaid agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and South Carolina refused to say how many names they were ordered to review or did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said in his X post that California had misspent $1.3 billion on care for people not eligible for Medicaid, while Illinois spent $30 million, Oregon $5.4 million, Washington state $2.4 million, Washington, D.C., $2.1 million, and Colorado $1.5 million.\n \n\n   \n  “We notified the states, and many have begun refunding the money,” he said. “But what if we had never asked?”\n \n\n   \n  Washington, D.C.’s Medicaid director, Melisa Byrd, said CMS had identified administrative expenses for the district program that covers people regardless of immigration status that should not have been billed to the federal government and her agency has already fixed some of those areas. “We run a big program that is very complex and when mistakes or errors happen, we fix them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The program plans to pay $654,014 back to CMS by mid-November.\n \n\n   \n  All five states, plus Washington, D.C., are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump didn’t win any of them in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill  began posting pictures  on X of people he said are convicted criminals living in the U.S. without authorization who had received Medicaid benefits.\n \n\n   \n  O’Neill could not be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “We are very concerned because this seems, frankly, to be a waste of state resources and furthers the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior health advocacy strategist with the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. “This duplicates what states already do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the administration’s crackdown on people in the U.S. without authorization, President Donald Trump in February directed federal agencies to take action to ensure they are not obtaining benefits in violation of federal law.\n \n\n   \n  In June, advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered CMS to share information about Medicaid enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security, drawing a lawsuit by some states alarmed that the administration would use the information for its deportation campaign against unauthorized residents.\n \n\n   \n  In August, a federal judge ordered HHS to  stop sharing the information  with immigration authorities.\n \n\n   \n  State Medicaid agencies use databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify enrollees’ immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  If states need to go back to individuals to reverify their citizenship or immigration status, it could lead some to fall off the rolls unnecessarily — for example, if they don’t see a letter requesting paperwork or fail to meet a deadline to respond.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not sure that evidence suggests there really is a need for this” extra verification, said Marian Jarlenski, a health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.\n \n\n   \n  Oz made clear that the Trump administration disagrees.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether willful or not, the states’ conduct highlights a terrifying reality: American taxpayers have been footing the bill for illegal immigrants’ Medicaid coverage, despite many Democrats and the media insisting otherwise,” Oz said in his X post.\n \n\n   \n  In an August press release, CMS said it would ask states to verify eligibility for enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases. “We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, called the CMS order to states “unprecedented” in the Medicaid program’s 60-year history.\n \n\n   \n  He said the federal government may have been unable to verify certain individuals’ immigration status because names were misspelled or outdated, such as when a beneficiary is identified by their maiden instead of married name. The names may also include people helped by Emergency Medicaid, a program that covers the cost of hospital emergency services, including labor and delivery, for people regardless of immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS is conducting pointless immigration status reviews for people whose hospital bills were paid by Emergency Medicaid,” Cuello said.\n \n\n   \n  Oz noted in his post that federal law “does permit states to use Medicaid dollars for emergency treatment, regardless of patients’ citizenship or immigration status,” and that states can “legally build Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants using their own state tax dollars, so long as no federal tax dollars are used.”\n \n\n   \n  The states Oz mentioned all  run their own  such programs.\n \n\n   \n  The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July. The measure, which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, makes many changes to Medicaid, including adding a work requirement in most states starting by 2027. The law also requires most states to more frequently check the eligibility of many adult Medicaid enrollees — at least twice a year.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear states may do unnecessary checks that create a burden for some enrollees who will lose health coverage who should not,” Cuello said. “It’s going to be a whole lot of work for CMS and states for very little pay dirt.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuello said the effort may have “greater political value than actual value.”\n \n\n   \n  Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid in the state, said the state already requires every Medicaid applicant to verify their citizenship or, where applicable, their eligible immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  However, he said, the directive issued by CMS “constitutes a new process, and DHS is carefully reviewing the list in order to take appropriate actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Oz did not name Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2024, in his post.\n \n\n   \n  If a lawful resident does not have a Social Security number, the state confirms their legal status by checking a database from Homeland Security, as well as verifying specific immigration documents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our teams just received this notice and are working through a process by which we will perform these reviews,” Jennifer Strohecker, then Utah’s Medicaid director, told a state advisory board in August.\n \n\n   \n   Renuka Rayasam and Rae Ellen Bichell contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/senate-filibuster-trump-republicans","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:59:00-04:00","title":"Republican Leaders Reject Ending the Senate Filibuster Despite Trump’s Call to Nuke It","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Republican leaders in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, have rejected President Donald Trump’s call to end the Senate filibuster, citing concerns about protecting minority rights, encouraging compromise, and preventing future extreme legislative actions.

Trump’s call to nuke it \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:59 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The top two Republicans in Congress are showing no interest in taking the unprecedented step of ending the legislative filibuster, just hours after President Donald Trump  made a fresh demand  for the Senate to do so to end the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In perhaps the clearest possible signal to the White House that Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not change Senate rules to end the already 31-day stalemate, a spokesman said the Republican leader remained unmoved.\n \n\n   \n  “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesperson Ryan Wrasse told CNN, reiterating the long-time view of Thune and many others in Senate leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Even House Speaker Mike Johnson — who rarely breaks with Trump in public — offered a cautious warning about keeping the filibuster intact.\n \n\n   \n  “The filibuster has traditionally been used as a very important safeguard,” Johnson said, noting that his own opinion is “not relevant” given it is a Senate-only issue. But the GOP speaker warned that Democrats would use the move to pass extreme measures the next time they control the upper chamber.\n \n\n   \n  “They would pack the Supreme Court, they would make Puerto Rico and DC states. They would ban firearms. They would do all sorts of things that would be very harmful to the country,” Johnson said, stressing that Trump’s late-night Truth Social post on the filibuster was an “expression of the president’s anger at this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  The rare split between congressional Republicans and the White House comes as the Washington stalemate and the pains of the shutdown around the country have deepened in recent days. But the GOP leaders’ swift move to quash Trump’s suggestion on the filibuster is a reflection of a clear political reality on Capitol Hill: There is little support for such a move within the Senate GOP conference.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Taking the so-called nuclear option would require near-unanimity, since Thune and Senate GOP leaders could only lose three votes from their own party to do so if all Democrats oppose the move. And the number of GOP senators currently opposed stands far higher than that, with at least a dozen Republicans on the record against it.\n \n\n   \n  Still, deploying the “nuclear option” would not entirely end the Senate’s filibuster. Instead, it would eliminate the 60-vote threshold to end debate, instead requiring 51 votes.\n \n\n   \n  One of those lawmakers, freshman Sen. John Curtis of Utah, made clear Friday morning that he remained opposed despite Trump’s urging.\n \n\n   \n  “The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it,” Curtis wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Several GOP senators have echoed that sentiment in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through any rules change.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Roger Marshall called the idea a “non-starter” earlier this month, saying that “a republic protects the rights of the minority. Otherwise you just take a poll and you switch the direction the ship is going. So that filibuster helps protect the minority, and I think it’s served our country well.”\n \n\n   \n  Also earlier in the month, Thune himself ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end it.\n \n\n   \n  His team’s Friday statement reaffirming the leader’s opposition had some Senate Republicans breathing a sigh of relief, according to one GOP senate staffer.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” the GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/jetblue-flight-emergency-landing-florida","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"14:02:00Z","title":"At least 15 people sent to hospital after JetBlue flight drops altitude, forcing emergency landing in Florida, officials say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A JetBlue flight (Flight 1230) from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced a sudden drop in altitude of about 100 feet in just seven seconds, prompting an emergency landing at Tampa International Airport.

JetBlue flight drops altitude, forcing emergency landing in Florida, officials say \n       \n  By Pete Muntean, Taylor Romine, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:02 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal investigation into “a flight control issue” is underway after at least 15 people, including children, were taken to the hospital following a sudden drop in altitude on a JetBlue flight that forced an emergency landing in Tampa, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Flight 1230 was heading Thursday from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, when it “experienced a drop in altitude,” JetBlue said in a statement, causing pilots to call for medical help. The plane diverted to Tampa International Airport around 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Aviation Administration said.\n \n\n   \n  The plane dropped about 100 feet in about seven seconds around 1:48 p.m. before making a more normal descent into Tampa, data from  FlightRadar24  shows. Medical personnel were there to meet the plane on arrival, an airport spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA is investigating a “flight control issue” on the Airbus A320, it said, echoing a pilot’s message to air traffic controllers around the time of the brief descent. The National Transportation Safety Board is aware of the incident but has not started an investigation, the agency told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The flight disruption comes in a  volatile year  for air travel, with a major  midair collision ,  runway incursions  and  serious turbulence  already in play before the monthlong  government shutdown  raised staffing issues for  air traffic controllers  as the  holiday travel season  looms.\n \n\n   \n  Just before Thursday’s emergency, a strong cold front passed through Florida, leaving gusty winds and light rain showers. It was not immediately clear if weather was a factor in the flight’s altitude drop.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘flight control issue’\n \n\n   \n  While it’s unclear why the plane dropped in altitude, pilots told air traffic control the plane had experienced “a flight control issue,” audio from  LiveATC.net  indicates.\n \n\n   \n  Flight control failure is not without precedent for the Airbus A320, which has what’s called fly-by-wire controls: Control inputs from the pilot run through computers to trigger movements of the plane’s control surfaces.\n \n\n   \n  While the system is quite redundant, a failure about 30 years ago of the computer controlling an Airbus A320’s elevator – which controls its pitch: the up and down movement of the nose and tail – caused a Northwest Airlines plane to dive a hundred feet without any command from the pilots. The NTSB investigated that incident.\n \n\n   \n  As air traffic controllers on Thursday guided the JetBlue flight into Tampa, pilots reported injuries, including a possible “laceration in the head,” the audio indicates.\n \n\n   \n  Some 15 to 20 people aboard the plane were evaluated and taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Tampa Fire Rescue spokesperson Vivian Shedd said.\n \n\n   \n  Two children and 12 adults were taken to Tampa’s St. Joseph’s Hospital with minor injuries, and all have been discharged, a hospital spokesperson said. No further details about injuries were available.\n \n\n   \n  “Our team has taken the aircraft out of service for inspection, and we will conduct a full investigation to determine the cause,” JetBlue said in its statement. “The safety of our customers and crewmembers is always our first priority, and we will work to support those involved.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Martin Goillandeau contributed to this reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-tomahawks-trump-ukraine","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"Pentagon Cleared Giving Ukraine Long-Range Tomahawk Missiles, Leaving Final Decision to Trump","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon has cleared the White House to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing no negative impact on US stockpiles, but President Donald Trump retains final political authority over the decision.

Tomahawks have a range of around 1,000 miles.\n \n\n   \n  The assessment buoyed the US’ European allies, who believ e  that the US now ha s  fewer excuses not to provide the missiles, two European officials said. Trump also said just days before meeting Zelensky that the US has “a lot of Tomahawks” that it could potentially give to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  US and European officials were surprised, therefore, when Trump dramatically changed his tune days later, saying during opening remarks at a White House working lunch with Zelensky that the US “needs” the Tomahawks.   He then told Zelensky behind closed doors that the US would not be providing them — at least not yet.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s decision came one day after he spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who told Trump that Tomahawks could hit major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield but would damage the US-Russia relationship, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The White House and Pentagon did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not taken the missiles off the table altogether, sources previously told CNN, and the administration has drawn up plans to provide them to Ukraine quickly should Trump give the order. Trump has also grown so frustrated in recent weeks with Putin’s unwillingness to seriously consider peace talks that he approved new US sanctions on Russian oil firms last week and scrapped — for now — a planned meeting with Putin in Budapest to discuss Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  While the Pentagon doesn’t have concerns about stockpiles, US defense officials are still grappling with how Ukraine would train on and deploy the missiles, officials said. There are still several operational issues that would need to be resolved for Ukraine to be able to use the missiles effectively, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  One outstanding question is how Ukraine would fire the missiles if the US provided them. Tomahawks are most commonly launched from surface ships or submarines, but Ukraine’s Navy is severely depleted ,  so the missiles would likely need to be launched on land. The Marine Corps and Army have developed ground-based launchers that could be provided to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  But even if the US did not want to provide the launchers, European officials believe Ukraine could figure out a workaround. One official pointed out that Ukrainian engineers were able to develop a workaround to use the UK-provided Storm Shadow missiles, which were originally designed to be used by modern NATO aircraft and had to be integrated into Ukraine’s aging, Soviet-era fighter jet fleet.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on X earlier this week, Zelenksy said Ukraine hopes to expand its long-range capabilities by the end of this year so the war can end “on fair terms” for the country.\n \n\n   \n  “Global sanctions and our pinpoint precision are practically syncing up to end this war on terms fair for Ukraine,” he wrote. “All deep-strike goals must be fully locked in by year’s end, including expansion of our long-range footprint.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/media/gayle-king-cbs-news-bari-weiss-ellison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:54:00-04:00","title":"CBS News Roiled by Rumors, with Gayle King’s Future the Latest Flashpoint","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CBS News is facing significant internal and external turmoil due to rumors and speculation about leadership changes, most notably the potential departure of long-time host Gayle King from 'CBS Mornings.'

latest flashpoint \n       \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:54 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  CBS News is in an unenviable position right now: It’s the subject of anonymously sourced reporting and rumor-mongering that’s sowing confusion while division-wide layoffs cause pain and corporate changes add to anxiety.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the reported changes at CBS have not happened yet and may never happen. But each story adds to the uncertainty and unease in the air. The latest one is about Gayle King, with Variety  reporting  that she is “expected to depart” her longtime TV home, “CBS Mornings,” next year.\n \n\n   \n  If that’s the case, it would be news to King, whose contract doesn’t expire for another six months. She  told TMZ on Friday  morning: “All I’ve been told by everybody in this building is that they want me here, they like the job I’ve been doing… What I’m hearing in the building is not what I’m reading in the press.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the CBS News management team is in whack-a-mole mode, trying to tamp down the speculation — and probably trying to avoid any potential blowback from viewers.\n \n\n   \n  All the instability stems from David Ellison’s recent takeover of Paramount and  his decision to appoint  Bari Weiss as the editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, the entrepreneurial and opinionated co-founder of The Free Press website, is an irresistible story to the media chattering classes. People both inside and outside CBS are desperate to know what she’s going to change at the storied news division.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, who has been on the job for just a few weeks, has been frustrated about the leaks relating to her arrival, according to a recent  New York Times report .\n \n\n   \n  She certainly deserves time and space to get to know CBS News and think through potential changes. But just this week, there have been stories about who Weiss may or may not want to keep at “60 Minutes;” who she may or may not want to hire for the “CBS Evening News;” and now, what might happen to the morning show.\n \n\n   \n  “You know the old adage: Nobody knows anything,” a CBS source remarked, pointing out that all the speculation is destabilizing in the meantime.\n \n\n   \n  The news division also  laid off about one hundred people  earlier this week, though the cuts were foreshadowed months ago, well before Weiss was hired.\n \n\n   \n    The morning show intrigue\n \n\n   \n  The CBS weekday morning show has undergone multiple permutations over the past decade, and King has been the central player throughout, helming the show while other co-hosts have come and gone.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, Variety reporters Matt Donnelly and Brian Steinberg wrote that King is “expected to depart” the show and “may shift to a different role at the news division,” potentially with “a deal to produce her own programming for the network.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair also wrote that “negotiations are about to ensue,” which left some CBS staffers wondering: Is someone prematurely leaking that King is departing, and if so, why? Or is King privately telling people that she wants out, no matter what CBS offers?\n \n\n   \n  All the broadcast networks have been trying to lower salary costs in recent years, so there is little doubt that CBS would want King to accept a pay cut to stay at the network in any capacity.\n \n\n   \n  CBS responded forcefully to the Variety article, saying, “There have been no discussions with Gayle about her contract that runs through May 2026.” (And King told TMZ on Friday, “I am not going to negotiate in the media.”)\n \n\n   \n  It is highly unusual for a network to say when a star’s contract is up, but it showed that the typical window for negotiations hasn’t even opened yet.\n \n\n   \n  As Variety noted, “Moving King is a risky maneuver, especially because morning-TV is built on the relationships viewers build with the hosts.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s likely why CBS said in its statement that King is “a truly valued part of CBS and we look forward to engaging with her about the future.”\n \n\n   \n  Her co-host on the morning show, Nate Burleson, also commented personally on Instagram, reflecting how the uncertainty is weighing on staffers at the network.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope this rumor doesn’t hold up,” he wrote, calling King “a fixture, a force, and a part of the fabric of ‘CBS Mornings.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/sport/tennis-joao-fonseca-profile-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"14:34:00Z","title":"Teenage tennis star and ‘generational talent’ João Fonseca tempering power with patience as he ascends the sport","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"João Fonseca, a 19-year-old Brazilian tennis prodigy, has emerged as a generational talent in men's tennis due to his powerful forehand and early success, including two ATP Tour titles this year, with a standout win in Basel.

      2:34 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ever since he first picked up a  tennis  racket,  João Fonseca  has shown a penchant for power – even if it came with mixed results.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the kind of kid that destroyed the ball,” says Fonseca. “Sometimes, it would go into the fence; sometimes, it would go straight to the floor; and then, sometimes, we’re doing a winner.”\n \n\n   \n  That approach – fearless, furious and unrestrained – has stayed with the Brazilian into his professional career, and today, his ripping forehand is one of the most breathtaking sights in men’s tennis.\n \n\n   \n  Few players can match the 19-year-old Fonseca when it comes to  raw power , particularly on the forehand wing. This not-so-subtle, not-so-secret weapon has guided him to two ATP Tour titles this year, including in the Swiss city of Basel last week.\n \n\n   \n  There, Fonseca thumped 29 winners to see off Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the final, while his average forehand speed was clocked at 81 miles per hour. For comparison, top players  usually average  around 75.\n \n\n   \n  “I think my coach was really the first one that said: ‘Keep with this aggression,’” Fonseca tells  CNN Sports  about his all-out approach. “‘Keep doing this, but at the same time, let’s work with being more solid.’\n \n\n   \n  “During these last years, I understood that you can’t hit the ball hard every time … Sometimes, it’s a stupid idea, of course, but sometimes, it’s good to be aggressive, to be courageous and have confidence in your shots.”\n \n\n   \n  Lifting the title in Basel saw Fonseca become the third-youngest ATP 500 winner since the format was introduced in 2009, as well as the tournament’s youngest winner since Jim Courier in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  Still a teenager, Fonseca’s potential is huge, his freakish power likely to become more of a threat as he develops and refines his game. To some, he is destined to join  Carlos Alcaraz  and  Jannik Sinner  – by far and away the standout players in men’s tennis this year – at the very top of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “The Brazilian Blaster (Fonseca) is a generational talent as I said 2 years ago and will be right there someday with the Italian Flamethrower (Sinner) and Spanish Magician (Alcaraz),” Rick Macci, the former coach to Serena Williams,  wrote  on X recently.\n \n\n   \n  Those players, Macci added, will “create a new big three” to replace Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.\n \n\n   \n  Davidovich Fokina spoke along the same lines during his runner-up speech in Basel, telling Fonseca that he is “for sure going to be the next Nole (Djokovic) to beat Carlos and Jannik.”\n \n\n   \n  After winning last year’s Next Gen ATP Finals title – a tournament featuring the world’s best players under 20 – Fonseca turned heads at the Australian Open in January with a straight-sets victory over ninth seed Andrey Rublev.\n \n\n   \n  He followed that up by winning the Argentina Open a month later, becoming the second-youngest South American to win an ATP title in the Open Era.\n \n\n   \n  But Fonseca’s progress hasn’t been exponential. He failed to progress past the third round of a grand slam this year, perhaps a surprise after the enormous promise he showed at the start of the season.\n \n\n   \n  The victory in Basel, however, reaffirmed his status as one of the most explosive talents in the game, with Fonseca climbing 18 spots up the rankings to No. 28. That puts him well on track to fulfill his self-ascribed objectives for next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I think one of my goals is to be a seed, top 32 (at a grand slam),” says Fonseca. “It’s my personal goal. I’m working a lot to do it … let’s see how it goes.”\n \n\n   \n  To get to this level, Fonseca had to spend his formative years building a bond with tennis. As a young player, the game would make him feel restless, and he often found himself chasing big, haymaking shots on the court. He was even more impatient off it, unable to watch a full match without losing interest.\n \n\n   \n  That changed around 2019, when Fonseca sat absorbed as Novak Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in a  Wimbledon  final lasting four hours and 57 minutes – the longest final in the tournament’s history.\n \n\n   \n  A self-proclaimed Federer superfan, that match hurt Fonseca. As he started to enjoy tennis as a spectator, he would often watch the “Big 3” play out match after memorable match on the sport’s biggest stages, but it was the Swiss star who captivated him the most.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s my idol,” Fonseca confesses. Which goes some way to explaining why he suddenly found himself a sweaty, nervous wreck before meeting Federer for the first time in September.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a nice chat, about 10 minutes, and we talked a little bit about life, tour, how it is to live in Brazil and be far from home,” says Fonseca, adding: “He’s a super nice guy. You see these amazing players, these legends, as untouchable (and think): this guy is different. But no, he’s just a human being like us, super cool.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a very important moment; it’s going to be in my mind for my whole life.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s likely that the two might cross paths again, particularly given that Fonseca is sponsored by On – the sportswear company in which Federer has invested and helped with product development. The Brazilian was only 16 when he was signed by On and earmarked as a star in the making, joining a roster that includes six-time grand slam winner  Iga Świątek  and world No. 7  Ben Shelton .\n \n\n   \n  Several years earlier, Fonseca had made the decision to focus his sporting endeavors solely on tennis, not long after a  soccer  injury had left him sidelined for months.\n \n\n   \n  Like most kids growing up in Rio de Janeiro, soccer was, and still is, one of his great loves, even though his playing days have long since passed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a good level,” says Fonseca. “I’m a lefty leg, I had some skills, but nothing serious. I wouldn’t be professional or whatever. Fortunately, I stayed with tennis.”\n \n\n   \n  After reaching the quarterfinals of last year’s Rio Open aged 17, Fonseca decided to forego his college eligibility – he was holding a place at the University of Virginia – and turn professional.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, his march up the world rankings has been steady, quickly earning him an army of dedicated fans. Fonseca’s matches are some of the loudest on tour, and regardless of whether he’s playing in Brazil or further afield, yellow-and-green-clad spectators are guaranteed whenever he’s on a tennis court.\n \n\n   \n  It’s taken time, Fonseca admits, to grow accustomed to playing in front of such raucous crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “At the beginning, I was super nervous,” he says. “I needed to win, and there are people watching me, there are people cheering for me. The culture of Brazil is super loud, a lot of people supporting, I’ll say a little bit because of football.\n \n\n   \n  “I got used a lot to the crowd. Nowadays, I love playing with the crowd. I love them supporting me. I love that sometimes I’m in a bad situation in the match and they’re still supporting me, still cheering and motivating me.\n \n\n   \n  “I was more like a shy guy,” he adds, “and now I’m loving it.”\n \n\n   \n  Playing in loud matches at big tournaments is likely to be a mainstay of Fonseca’s career. He is slowly accumulating more experience against the world’s best players but hasn’t yet faced Djokovic – he’s hopeful of doing so before the Serb, now 38, retires – nor has he played either Alcaraz or Sinner.\n \n\n   \n  Those kinds of matches might become a regular occurrence should Fonseca, armed with that ferocious forehand, continue his march up the rankings. For now, he is watching closely as two players just a few years his senior rule over men’s tennis, sharing the past eight grand slams equally between them.\n \n\n   \n  One day, Fonseca might be in a position to challenge their duopoly.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is amazing,” he says of Alcaraz and Sinner. “They’re winning every tournament that they play.\n \n\n   \n  “They motivate all the other players to put more work in day by day, and try to be with them, try to win more tournaments, try to win matches, be more consistent. Hopefully, in the future, I will be with them, playing and competing in finals. But one step at a time, and let’s put in the work.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/donald-trump-end-shutdown-filibuster","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump Just Kneecapped the GOP’s Shutdown Strategy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, during a government shutdown that lasted nearly a month, issued a late-night call on Truth Social urging Republican leaders to invoke the 'nuclear option'—eliminating the Senate filibuster—to end the shutdown.

\n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After the government had been shut down for nearly a month, a conspicuously quiet  President Donald Trump  finally weighed in with a prescription for how to end it.\n \n\n   \n  Republican congressional leaders are probably wishing he hadn’t.\n \n\n   \n  Trump late Thursday night urged Republicans to end the shutdown by  invoking the so-called “nuclear option”  — that is, getting rid of the filibuster and 60-vote threshold in the Senate. This would allow Republicans to pass things on party-line votes in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE STONE COLD ‘CRAZY,’ THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  That Trump would call for this is not terribly surprising; he has spent years occasionally urging Republican leaders to scrap the filibuster. Nor is it particularly likely to provide an actual offramp in the shutdown; those same GOP leaders have steadfastly declined Trump’s entreaties before and rejected this idea repeatedly in recent weeks. It’s not even clear whether enough senators would vote for such a change if GOP leaders went along with it.\n \n\n   \n  So practically speaking, it’s a pointless interjection from the president.\n \n\n   \n  But it does matter in one way: It’s Trump yet again inserting himself into these kinds of talks in ways that are thoroughly unhelpful to his party. And this has become a trend.\n \n\n   \n  The reason it’s unhelpful in this case is that it legitimizes Democrats’ talking point that Republicans could end this shutdown any time they want to. And that could make it harder for Republicans to shake the blame they’ve been saddled with.\n \n\n   \n  It’s been pretty remarkable how much Americans have  continued to blame Republicans  more than Democrats for the shutdown, despite it being Democrats who are seeking the concession (i.e. an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies). A  Washington Post-ABC News poll  released Thursday showed 45% of Americans mainly blamed Trump and the GOP, versus 33% who held Democrats responsible.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, the idea that Republicans could end the shutdown anytime they want is a vastly oversimplified talking point. Yes, all they need is a majority of the Senate to nuke the filibuster. But there are myriad reasons to avoid invoking that nuclear option. And Republican leaders have pointed to them for weeks — specifically invoking what they fear Democrats could do without that 60-vote threshold if they regain control of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month called the filibuster “a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening to the country.” (His spokesperson on Friday said the leader’s position is “unchanged.”) Fellow Senate GOP leader John Barrasso of Wyoming argued that nixing the filibuster would ultimately allow Democrats to make Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia into states, with two senators apiece, and to pack the Supreme Court. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would mean there would be “no stumbling blocks or hurdles at all in the way of turning us into a communist country.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump is now legitimizing blaming his own party for the shutdown because they won’t have done the thing he told them to do.\n \n\n   \n  And if you’re a Republican in Congress, you’ve probably got déjà vu about now. That’s because Trump does stuff like this a lot – especially during shutdown debates.\n \n\n   \n  In early 2018, Trump  contradicted his own spokeswoman’s statement  of support for a short-term continuing resolution, making a late demand to scrap an extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program.\n \n\n   \n  Trump then pulled another  11th-hour shift a few weeks later , demanding immigration concessions that hadn’t previously been a focal point of leaders’ efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Before he was sworn in to his second term in January, Trump and Elon Musk combined in December to play the role of legislative arsonists again. GOP leaders had negotiated a bipartisan deal to avert a shutdown. But then Musk started waging war against it on X. Trump then joined him and  threw another wrench in the cogs , suddenly demanding a debt ceiling increase that hadn’t really been a part of discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has regularly given congressional Republicans fits in these situations – so much so that they’ll occasionally acknowledge their frustrations publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in early 2018  practically pleaded with Trump  to engage in the process and provide some direction. “As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels,” the Kentucky Republican said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump threw a late grenade in the process in December, Sen. Kevin Cramer said he was “very frustrated.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN’s Manu Raju asked the North Dakota Republican if he wished Trump had signaled his demands earlier, Cramer  responded dryly : “Yeah, I mean, maybe he hadn’t thought about it until just today. But yeah, that would have been very helpful.”\n \n\n   \n  None of this means Trump’s late entry into this shutdown debate is a game-changer.

And it immediately ratcheted up the pressure on Republican leaders, who have adamantly opposed eliminating the  60-vote threshold for passing legislation  as a way to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Top GOP lawmakers have long argued for keeping that threshold in place, asserting that the filibuster benefits Republicans — and will serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said in a statement to CNN Friday, “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.” The statement had some in his party breathing a sigh of relief.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” a GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   \n  Several GOP senators have echoed Thune’s sentiment in recent days in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through the rules change. Killing the filibuster would take a majority vote in the Senate, meaning Republicans could only lose three lawmakers assuming all Democrats oppose the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday morning, Sen. John Curtis of Utah  posted on X  that he remained a “firm no” on eliminating the filibuster, writing that “the filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump on Thursday appeared to dismiss those concerns, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government. The president made a similar case during his first term, though Senate Republicans never acted on it at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the  longest-ever government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n   Critical food aid  for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend. The White House on Thursday also sought to highlight the stress that the shutdown is putting on air traffic controllers by convening a roundtable of airline industry representatives and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n   This story  has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/weather/noaa-hurricane-hunters-shutdown-unpaid-melissa","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:54:00-04:00","title":"Hurricane Hunters Fly Into Historic Storm Without Pay Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a federal government shutdown, NOAA’s Hurricane Hunters conducted continuous, mission-critical flights into Hurricane Melissa — one of the strongest storms on record — without pay.

They have done it around the clock, 24/7, because their mission is considered essential to public safety.\n \n\n   \n  But this time, with the government shut down, they have done it all without pay.\n \n\n   \n  The Hurricane Hunters are a standard feature of US storm response. Information gathered by the planes’ specialized equipment, which includes a tail-mounted doppler radar that takes a virtual CT scan of the storm, are crucial for issuing accurate forecasts and gauging storm strength in real-time.\n \n\n   \n  The data, including the radar information, is fed straight into the computer models that forecasters use to predict a hurricane’s path and intensity.\n \n\n   \n  But as long-lived Hurricane Melissa rumbled on through the week, the people operating the flights have been under increasing financial stress.\n \n\n   \n  The crews of the agency’s decades-old WP-3D aircraft have now missed two paychecks due to the shutdown, according to a NOAA employee with knowledge of the hurricane hunter operations, who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n \n\n   \n  Crews are asked “To be fully mentally present, especially in this environment, and it’s hard to do that when you know you can’t potentially make ends meet,” the NOAA staff member said. “You’re dipping into savings to pay off your mortgage, you know, week to week or month to month.”\n \n\n   \n  The flights through the once Category 5 storm have been particularly hairy, with one of the NOAA aircraft having to return to its base for a safety inspection after exceeding its g-force limits from the turbulence.\n \n\n   \n  Videos during that flight show equipment falling from the ceiling of the plane, with roughly 20 crew members cursing and laughing as they are thrown against their safety harnesses.\n \n\n   \n  Following an inspection by ground crews, who are also working without pay, that same aircraft flew out later the same day on another mission into the storm, the NOAA staff member said.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA crews have met all the requests that the National Hurricane Center has made of them ,  the employee said. The Center assigns them to specific flight routes and schedules where scientists think in-situ data would improve the forecasts as much as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s just a notable thing that we have these crews going around the clock supporting the important mission that it is,” despite enduring increasing financial hardship, they said.\n \n\n   \n  They said the NOAA flights have been fully staffed with about 20 crew members per flight.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA flights continued as the  storm plowed into Jamaica , doing immense damage to the island nation and killing at least 19 people.\n \n\n   \n  They have kept flying to support America’s international partners, with flights on Thursday aimed at making sure Bermuda residents get accurate warnings of the storm’s intensity and path.\n \n\n   \n  NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster acknowledged the crews’ hard work and their financial stress. “NOAA looks forward to a swift end to the crippling federal government shutdown which is forcing essential workers and service members like our brave Hurricane Hunter pilots to go unpaid as they perform their mission-critical duties that protect the lives of Americans every day,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Air Force Reserve also flies into hurricanes and has flown numerous missions into Melissa, but those planes are not bristling with the same specialized equipment that the older NOAA aircraft are. They fly a more straightforward reconnaissance mission, keeping tabs of the storm’s intensity and movement, whereas the NOAA flights are aimed more at hurricane research and enabling forecasting improvements.\n \n\n   \n  Remarkably, one of the Air Force flights also had to turn around after getting beaten up by severe turbulence flying through Melissa. CNN reached out to the Air Force’s Hurricane Hunter squadron to inquire about their pay status but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unusual for two flights to have to turn back within the same storm and indicates the hurricane’s power during its approach to southwestern Jamaica. Melissa crossed the Jamaican coast tied for the strongest-ever landfalling Atlantic hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.\n \n\n   \n  Andy Hazelton, a hurricane researcher who works with NOAA’s hurricane research division at the University of Miami, told CNN earlier this week that the NOAA flight that had to turn around due to turbulence was the roughest ride in a hurricane that he has had since he began such work seven years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “You hit a big enough updraft and downdraft you have to make sure the plane is ok,” Hazelton, who is being paid during the shutdown via the university, said. “These crews are doing this all while not getting paid, so they deserve all the credit.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/andrew-mountbatten-windsor-what-next-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:26:00+00:00","title":"Prince no longer: What next for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, has been stripped of all royal titles and honors by King Charles III, following public outcry over his ties to convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein and allegations of sexual misconduct with Virginia Giuffre.

Andrew Mountbatten Windsor? \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:26 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A fortnight ago, he was  Prince Andrew , Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.\n \n\n   \n  Now, he is simply Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, Buckingham Palace announced that  King Charles III  had started a process to strip his brother of his titles and honors and evict him from the royal estate at Windsor, capping Andrew’s fall from grace over his ties to the convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. By the next morning, Andrew’s name had already been removed from the official role of the peerage – a crucial step in the formal scrapping of his titles.\n \n\n   \n  While the royal family hopes this move can draw a line under this years-long scandal,  questions  are swirling about where Andrew, 65, will live, whether he could yet face more legal troubles and whether his banishment will appease the British public. Here, we answer some of those.\n \n\n   \n    Where will Andrew sleep tonight?\n \n\n   \n  Most likely in  Royal Lodge , the grand 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park, west of London, which has been Andrew’s home since 2003. The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, and his 75-year lease was due to expire in 2078.\n \n\n   \n  But in its Thursday night statement, Buckingham Palace said Andrew had been served formal notice to surrender his lease and that he would “move to alternative private accommodation.” It is understood that he will move as soon as is practicable.\n \n\n   \n    Where will he live in the future?\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources have told CNN that Andrew will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. That vast estate on England’s eastern coast is home to some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  It is also where the royal family spends Christmas. Before the Thursday night announcement, Andrew had already been told he would not be welcome at the country retreat over the holidays, a royal source had said.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew might not move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, another source said, because giving notice, surrendering the lease and orchestrating the move is expected to take some time.\n \n\n   \n    Will he receive an income?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, but we don’t know how much. After he stepped back from public duties following his disastrous 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Andrew was thought to receive an annual allowance of about £1 million ($1.3 million) from the late Queen, according to British media reports.\n \n\n   \n  Those payments initially continued under Charles, the reports said, but it is understood that the King had stopped providing the allowance.\n \n\n   \n  Despite now being stripped of his prince title, CNN understands that Andrew will still receive an income from Charles.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s finances have always been something of a mystery. His only source of income that has been declared is the pension he receives from his time in the navy between 1979 and 2001, said to amount to £20,000 ($26,000) a year.\n \n\n   \n    Is he still in the line of succession?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew may have lost his titles, status and honors but he is still eighth in line to the British throne.\n \n\n   \n  There is a process to formally remove him from the line of succession by legislation, but it would take time as it requires the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world.\n \n\n   \n  The last time this protocol was invoked was in 1936 with the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n    What will happen to his family?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew and Sarah Ferguson divorced in 1996 but have lived together at Royal Lodge in Windsor since 2008. His ex-wife reverted to her maiden name earlier this month when Andrew relinquished the use of his royal titles, including Duke of York. She is also moving out of Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements. It is understood that she will not be joining Andrew when he moves to Sandringham.\n \n\n   \n  Their daughters, Princess Beatrice, 37, and Princess Eugenie, 35, are non-working royals and will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Beatrice lives with her husband in the Cotswolds, about 100 miles from London, but has an apartment at St. James’s Palace in the capital. Eugenie and her husband have a cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace but spend a lot of time abroad. Their living situations will not be affected by their father’s exile.\n \n\n   \n    Could he be hauled in front of parliament?\n \n\n   \n  The Liberal Democrats, an opposition party, have lately called for Andrew to give evidence to a parliamentary committee about his finances and potential rent paid to live in Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to give members of parliament time to debate Andrew’s finances, despite public outcry for proper scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  This week, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative lawmaker and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, wrote to the Crown Estate Commissioners seeking more information on Andrew’s lease arrangements for Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  That committee is responsible for “upholding best value for taxpayers’ money,” Clifton-Brown wrote, and as such “we feel it is reasonable to seek further information on the status of, and rationale for, the lease of Royal Lodge.”\n \n\n   \n    Might he face further legal challenges?\n \n\n   \n  Potentially. Republic, an activist group seeking to abolish the monarchy, says it is pursuing a private prosecution of Andrew “because if the government and police won’t hold him to account, we will.”\n \n\n   \n  The group says it has instructed lawyers to investigate and, if appropriate, begin a private prosecution over allegations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.\n \n\n   \n   Virginia Giuffre , a prominent accuser of Epstein and his circle, alleged that Andrew had sex with her three times when she was a teenager. In her recent memoir, published posthumously, Giuffre wrote that Andrew “believed that having sex with me was his birthright.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite claiming never to have met her, Andrew reportedly paid millions of dollars to Giuffre in 2022 to settle a civil case she brought against him. He has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre died by suicide in April. On Thursday, Sky and Amanda Roberts, Giuffre’s brother and sister-in-law, told CNN that Giuffre would have been “joyous” to know that Andrew had been stripped of the title that helped shield him from accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “I think she would be proud, and I think she would turn to her children and say, ‘I did it. I got the bad guy,’” said Amanda Roberts.\n \n\n   \n    Will this be enough for the British public?\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to say. Andrew is deeply unpopular with the British public. In a poll published Thursday by YouGov, 91% of Britons had a negative opinion of Andrew. Just 4% had a positive one. By contrast, Britons generally like Prince William (76%) and Charles (62%), and overall have a positive view of the monarchy as an institution (56%).\n \n\n   \n  If Andrew’s fall from grace began in earnest after his 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, the royal family have repeatedly tried to draw a line under the scandal – first by Andrew’s withdrawing from public life, then by removing his military titles and patronages, later cutting him off financially, then by his relinquishing some of his titles – and now by the King casting him out of the palace for good as a pariah.\n \n\n   \n  None of the measures have quelled the public outcry. It remains to be seen whether this time will be different.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the Andrew scandal has roiled on for so long because, for the public, his “punishments” do not seem proportionate to the allegations that he faces. While the loss of his titles and favored residence may be a personal tragedy for Andrew, it elicits little sympathy from a public demanding proper accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t matter if he’s Prince Andrew or Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – we’re still pursuing a private prosecution of him,” said Republic, the activist group.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/prince-andrew-title-and-honors-remove-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:27:00-04:00","title":"King Charles strips his brother Andrew of ‘prince’ title and evicts him from royal mansion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a landmark move, King Charles III has initiated the formal stripping of Prince Andrew’s royal titles and evicted him from Royal Lodge in Windsor, citing serious lapses in judgment related to his connections with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations of sexual assault by Virginia Giuffre.

The question now: whether King Charles and the British establishment have done enough to prevent Andrew’s association with  Epstein  from engulfing the monarchy.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre – who the prince claims never to have met – died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in a statement on Thursday: “Today, an ordinary American girl, from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.”\n \n\n   \n  Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, told CNN that it had been a “joyous and happy and sad day.”\n \n\n   \n  In the statement, Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew would be forced out of his residence and take the family name. “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His  lease on Royal Lodge  has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, about 100 miles north of London, which is privately owned by the British monarch. Royal Lodge sits within Windsor Great Park, part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state. Andrew’s new accommodation will be privately funded by King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  It’s understood the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is not expected to move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, according to a royal source.\n \n\n   \n  Moving in the new year might also avoid potential awkwardness over the holidays as Sandringham is traditionally where the royal family gathers for the festive season. It was previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from Christmas celebrations.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had sought to end the renewed scrutiny of his conduct by relinquishing  use of his titles  earlier this month. But his moves did little to stem the flow of negative headlines and sparked fresh questions about how he was able to pay Giuffre a reportedly multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil case in 2022 and fund his lifestyle despite having not been a working royal since 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Public anger has also grown after it emerged last week that he paid $1 million for Royal Lodge, in the heart of Windsor Great Park near Windsor Castle, in 2003, and only a peppercorn rent “if demanded” each year since then, according to his lease agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Thursday’s announcement, Andrew remains eighth in line to the British throne. That status  could be removed  by legislation, but it would require the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world, which would take time. The last time this protocol was used was when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that rather than formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York via an act of parliament, King Charles will send royal warrants to remove Andrew’s peerages.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The stripping of his titles takes immediate effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  In his interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Sky Roberts said King Charles’ decision vindicated the years of campaigning by his sister. “She should be here. She should be having this interview with you,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had been fighting for this for a long time. She always said… only one of us is telling the truth and I know that’s me,” Roberts said. “We’re really proud of her. We’re so proud of what she was able to achieve.”\n \n\n   \n  Calling it a “huge moment” for his sister and other survivors, Roberts said: “It’s an acknowledgement to say, we believe you. We see you. And for me, I love you. We love you… This is a very vindicating moment for us. And I just wish she was here to to share this with us.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in their statement they would fight to ensure other associates of Epstein would face similar judgement. “Our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory,” the statement said, adding they will “not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”\n \n\n   \n    Calls for Andrew to face justice continue\n \n\n   \n  The anti-monarchy group Republic said Thursday that it had instructed lawyers to launch a private prosecution against Andrew “over accusations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.”\n \n\n   \n  The group said its lawyers would be actively investigating the case against Andrew and aim to begin proceedings in the coming weeks. Republic has previously called for the police to investigate Andrew.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be very clear, Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatton Windsor – is not facing justice. He’s not being held to account. Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said Thursday following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the British monarch was  heckled by a protester  who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.\n \n\n   \n    Andrew’s daughters to retain princess titles\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign – in line with rules set out by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lived with him for the past 20 years at Royal Lodge, will also move out and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Ferguson, 66, is the mother of Andrew’s two children. They wed in 1986 and divorced a decade later. She previously held the title of Duchess of York, but reverted to her maiden name when Andrew relinquished his titles earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also understands that the British government was consulted on the King’s decisions, and the government has made it clear that it supports the moves.\n \n\n   \n  The last time a prince had his title removed is understood to be more than 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. The action was taken after he fought in World War I for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s MiSeon Lee contributed to this report.

Is it too little too late? \n       \n  Analysis by Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:30 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  King Charles’  decision  to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy as well as the  30-room mansion  where he’s lived for more than 20 years was as sudden as it was dramatic.\n \n\n   \n  It is the ultimate humiliation for the 65-year-old now-former prince,  known to enjoy the trappings and privilege of royal life. He will move out of Royal Lodge, his sprawling mansion in the heart of the Windsor estate just outside of London, and be exiled to the countryside to live in obscurity.\n \n\n   \n  The monarchy had been under intense pressure to resolve the Andrew issue amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which was further inflamed by the release of his sexual abuse accuser  Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.  Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks ago, Andrew  gave up the use  of his titles and honors, more than five years after  stepping back as a frontline royal . He said he was putting “duty to my family and country first,” but it did little to stop the snowballing scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Thursday evening, a brusque bombshell announcement from Buckingham Palace: Andrew is to lose his princely status, and effective immediately he is plain old Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, a commoner.\n \n\n   \n  The palace statement was clear – the decision was the king’s and Andrew had no choice in the matter (although he is understood not to have objected to his brother’s actions). Notable in the statement too, an expression of solidarity with victims of abuse.\n \n\n   \n  The significance of Charles’ moves on Thursday cannot be overstated. ﻿Not since the abdication crisis of 1936 has there been such a public casting aside of a senior British royal.\n \n\n   \n  The decision would doubtless have been difficult – and, given the personal family dynamics at play, deeply personal. But the monarch had no choice – Andrew’s controversies have been dogging the family for years and the publication of his accuser’s posthumous memoir was the final straw. The negotiations to get to this stage will have been challenging but the monarch had no option but to engage damage control mode.\n \n\n   \n  It was not just the public that had expressed outrage and frustration; there had also been increasing calls for Andrew to appear before a parliamentary committee. Perhaps this move will head off that particular indignity.\n \n\n   \n  Royal historian Kate Williams said the King’s decision was “unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a huge move from the royal family. Just recently, the King announced that Andrew was stepping back from the title Duke of York just a few days before Ms. Giuffre’s memoir was published. But that simply wasn’t enough for public opinion,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We have had people in the past losing the title of prince or princess. Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) said his daughters were no longer legitimate after he annulled the marriages with their mothers, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn – but he changed his mind later.”\n \n\n   \n  She also pointed out Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – whose title of the Duke of Albany was removed by parliament in 1917 after he fought for Germany in World War I. But Andrew’s situation, Williams said, was different as he was censured because of his serious errors of judgment.\n \n\n   \n  The King’s moves were welcomed by many British politicians. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that “the King has clearly felt that this is the right decision for the royal family” but added that it “must have been a very difficult thing” to act against his own sibling.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats said Andrew’s situation “had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”\n \n\n   \n  For several weeks, it has felt like some sort of announcement was coming down the pike and was simply a case of when, rather than if.\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources told CNN that the King was trying to act swiftly following recent developments but had needed some time to consult legal and constitutional experts.\n \n\n   \n  It is also understood that the King took action in light of his sibling’s serious lapses of judgment and has the support of the wider family, including Prince William.\n \n\n   \n  The statement, when it came, was uncompromising. “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  For many people in the country, and certainly critics of the royal family, these moves might not be enough to rehabilitate the monarchy’s tarnished reputation. For some, the removal of Andrew’s status as prince only goes so far. Other critics say the family has shielded Andrew over the years, and pressure for some sort of accountability needs to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite being stripped of his prince title, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. Royal sources have told CNN that he will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, and will receive an income from Charles as well.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is not expected to move from his Windsor mansion to Sandringham in Norfolk until after the Christmas holidays, according to a royal source. The move will happen as soon as possible and practical, but the process of giving notice, surrendering the lease and other practicalities of the relocation can be a drawn-out process.\n \n\n   \n  Moving in the new year might also avoid potential awkwardness over the holidays as Sandringham is traditionally where the royal family gathers for the festive season. It was previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from Christmas celebrations with the rest of the Windsor clan.\n \n\n   \n  His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has been living with Andrew at Royal Lodge for the last two decades, is moving out as well and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Their two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear if the King’s actions will be enough to give a public perception that the situation has been handled, but Charles seems to be doing as much as he feels he can within his own royal prerogative.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/travel/the-worlds-best-hotels-for-2025-revealed","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"11:46:00-10:31","title":"The world’s best hotel for 2025 is a waterfront skyscraper","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rosewood Hong Kong, a 65-storey waterfront luxury hotel in Hong Kong designed by Taiwanese architect Tony Chi, has been named the world’s best hotel for 2025 in the annual World’s 50 Best Hotels list.

Hardingham-Gill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:46 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s only been open for six years, but Rosewood Hong Kong has quickly become a distinguished feature of Hong Kong’s iconic skyline, as well as a force to be reckoned with in the luxury hotel scene.\n \n\n   \n  And after landing in the top three of the World’s 50 Best Hotels list twice, the 65-storey property came in  first place  this year.\n \n\n   \n  Designed by Taiwanese designer Tony Chi, the contemporary 413-room hotel beat out last year’s winner, Capella Bangkok, in the highly anticipated list from the global hospitality brand 50 Best, announced at an awards ceremony in London last night.\n \n\n   \n  Angus Pitkethley, complex director of sales and marketing for Rosewood Hong Kong, told the crowd at the Old Billingsgate events venue that it was a “real surprise and a real honor” to come out on top this year.\n \n\n   \n    World-class service\n \n\n   \n  “What an emotional night here in London…” Pitkethley added. “Just a huge amount of pride and gratitude to be recognized with this award.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked what he believed was the secret to the Rosewood Hong Kong’s success, Pitkethley credited the staff at the $650-a-night hotel, which is located on the Kowloon waterfront in Hong Kong.\n \n\n   \n  “We have an incredible team back at the hotel, who are not only passionate about hospitality, but really passionate about Hong Kong,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Describing this year’s list as “a true celebration of the very best properties from 22 destinations across six continents,” Emma Sleight, head of content for The World’s 50 Best Hotels, was full of praise for the Rosewood Hong Kong, which opened in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  “This exceptional hotel offers world-class service and sensational guest experiences in the heart of one of the world’s most bustling and dynamic destinations,” said Sleight.\n \n\n   \n  “Rosewood Hong Kong’s positioning as No.1 further consolidates Asia as a leading luxury travel destination for both business and leisure travelers.”\n \n\n   \n    Asia dominates\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Four Seasons Bangkok at Chao Phraya River, a 299-room retreat located in the center of the Thai capital’s creative district, came in second place, closely followed by Capella Bangkok, which took third place on the list, which was heavily dominated by Asian hotels.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Passalacqua, a boutique hotel located in Italy’s Lake Como was the only non-Asian hotel in the top five. The 18th-century villa took fourth place this year, making it the highest ranked European hotel, and was also named the Best Boutique Hotel.\n \n\n   \n  Historic hotel Raffles Singapore, the birthplace of the Singapore Sling cocktail, rounded out the top five.\n \n\n   \n  Other hotels in the Asian region featured on the list included Mandarin Oriental Bangkok (No.7), Upper House Hong Kong (No.10), Bulgari Tokyo (No.15), Aman Tokyo (No.25), Janu Tokyo (No.37), Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong (No.41), and The Tokyo Edition Toranomon (No.45).\n \n\n   \n    Very best properties\n \n\n   \n  The highest ranked hotel in North America was Chablé Yucatán (No. 8), one of four Mexican hotels featured. A former 19th-century hacienda, nestled in the Mayan jungle, Chablé Yucatán is “inspired by nature, culture, and human connection,” said Diego Gutiérrez, CEO of Chablé Hotels, in a press release. The Mark in New York was a new entry this year, placing at No.43 and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles ranked at No.42.\n \n\n   \n  Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, which also won the Lavazza Highest New Entry Award, and Rosewood São Paulo were the only South American hotels on the list, placing at No.11 and No.24 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Dubai’s Atlantis The Royal, No.6, was the highest ranked hotel in the Middle East, while Capella Sydney, No.12, beat out the competition for the Oceana region. At No.13, Marrakech’s Royal Mansour was the highest ranked hotel in Africa.\n \n\n   \n  The World’s Best Hotel list is decided by the World’s 50 Best Hotel Academy, which is made up of 800 hotel industry experts, including hoteliers and travel journalists, spread across 13 destinations around the globe.\n \n\n   \n    The World’s 50 Best Hotels 2025\n \n\n   \n  1.

And the government is more shut than ever.\n \n\n   \n  Washington woke Thursday to a whiff of rare hope that  behind-the-scenes efforts  were accelerating in the Senate to end a federal shutdown now imposing severe pain on millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  But the day ended with senators skipping town for the weekend — to join members of the House not seen inside the Beltway for so long it’s hard to remember what they look like.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made his first intervention in the shutdown drama since returning from a trip to Asia,  calling on Senate Republicans to end the filibuster  — the device that requires 60 votes to pass most major legislation and currently represents the only brake on his power that Democrats have in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Such a move would allow Republicans to open the government while bypassing Democratic demands. But it would open the possibility that Democrats could pass into law sweeping progressive reforms and roll back swaths of the conservative agenda if they control both chambers of Congress at some point in the future. Trump may not care what happens when he’s no longer president, but eliminating the filibuster would represent a fundamental political shift.\n \n\n   \n  This new wrinkle in Trump’s strategy will no doubt pile more pressure on Senate Majority Leader John Thune. And while Trump can shift his position from one moment to the next, his new gambit may indicate he’s more interested in crushing Democrats than seeking a way out of the increasingly damaging shutdown. Republican leaders in both parties have stated they don’t support ending the filibuster because of the implications for any future Democratic majority.\n \n\n   \n  What’s so galling in the current shutdown   is that both Republicans and Democrats insist they are keeping faith with their duties — taking care of the American people — but that the other side is willing to drive ordinary citizens to the brink of hunger or sickness.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown, refusing to extend federal funding until Republicans agree to extend expiring  enhanced Obamacare subsidies , without which millions of citizens will see  the cost of health care rocket .\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are willing to talk — but only when the government is opened again. Their assurances aren’t being taken at face value since their president routinely ignores the terms of deals and Congress’ constitutionally sound decisions on how to spend taxpayer money.\n \n\n   \n  The result:  Vital SNAP benefits  that help feed more than 40 million people are within hours of running out. Federal workers deemed essential have slogged through demoralizing weeks without pay. And it’s no vacation for their furloughed colleagues either: Financial obligations aren’t shut down just because the government is.\n \n\n   \n  Little is evident on the horizon that could prevent the monthlong shutdown from becoming the longest on record next week.\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of meaningful progress, dismayed lawmakers spent the day venting and trading insults.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accused Republicans of starving kids. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of putting extreme pressure  on air traffic controllers , implying they were risking the nation’s “extra safe” skies.\n \n\n   \n  Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said that staying in town for another weekend waiting for Democrats to come to the table “is gonna be a waste of time.” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, told CNN’s Dana Bash he was shocked “at the level of cruelty” shown by his GOP colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  And renegade Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has had it up to here with everyone. “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month,”  Fetterman told CNN . He also complained about his own party’s tactics. “We can’t even get our sh*t together and just open up our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    One judge says she won’t let people die\n \n\n   \n  Democrats might have some justification in arguing that Republicans and their health care policies and endless attempts to kill Obamacare set the stage for this crisis. But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.\n \n\n   \n  But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government. And any victory for either party at this point will be hollow, since it will be built on the suffering of citizens.\n \n\n   \n  One federal judge in Boston is doing what the judiciary often seems to do these days: stepping in where Congress has failed.  US District Judge Indira Talwani  signaled she will intervene in the dispute over the Trump administration’s refusal to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to fund food stamps under SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” Talwani said in the kind of plain English that lawmakers seem to shed when they get to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, Talwani said. “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger.\n \n\n   \n    Is there any hope for a breakthrough?\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes in Washington, the darkest hour is the one before dawn. So maybe there’s a chance the vicious rhetoric is a smokescreen allowing everyone to vent before they compromise.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s another characteristic of modern Washington that may be more apt right now — the way that disaster always has to nearly strike before two parties mired in their ideological extremes find a sliver of common ground.\n \n\n   \n  But at some point, this shutdown will end. It has to.\n \n\n   \n  If the denouement does not come from a president who discovers a moral or political imperative to live up to his 2016 convention vow, “I alone can fix it,” it may emerge from a creative fudge in the Senate in which Republicans give a handful of Democratic senators political cover to vote to break the filibuster and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Thune — who ditched his suave self-control on Wednesday to  rage at Democrats  in a Senate rant — struck one hopeful note when he said there was an uptick in bipartisan conversations this week. “We got members on both sides who are continuing to dialogue,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune doesn’t yet have the political space to offer Democrats the kind of tangible deliverables they would need. “When they’re willing to produce the votes to open up the government, we’re going to talk,” he said, restating the sticking point.\n \n\n   \n  One possible endgame scenario is that the Senate could blur the sequencing of when the government reopens and talks get serious on Obamacare subsidies. But knowing how something might eventually end is easier than getting there.\n \n\n   \n  Therefore, in the absence of progress, everyone had to fill the space.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now beginning Day 30 of the Democrat shutdown,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana. “There are millions of Americans … that are bracing themselves for further pain and hardship.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York accused the administration of enacting “policy violence” by refusing to extend Obamacare subsidies while offering a  $20 billion bailout  to Trump’s MAGA pal President Javier Milei in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said he wasn’t worried about his own air travel as air traffic control snarls, but did “worry about the flights of thousands and thousands of people.” Mixing transportation metaphors, he accused Democrats of being “way off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n  And Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York followed his warning on Wednesday that Trump “is a vindictive politician and a heartless politician and a heartless man” by accusing Republicans of bringing down “the specter of financial disaster” on Americans — including in red states — over health care.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not exactly promising.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune told reporters, “I’m always optimistic. Aren’t you?”\n \n\n   \n  That’s a tough one, senator.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting as well as to correct Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ state, Wyoming. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/africa/tanzania-opposition-dispute-election-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:40:00-04:00","title":"What to know about a disputed election in Tanzania, where single-party rule is being challenged","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tanzania is experiencing a major political crisis following a disputed presidential election, where President Samia Suluhu Hassan, the country’s first female leader, is accused of running a largely unopposed campaign despite 16 registered candidates.

\nUpdated: \n        10:40 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Protests are spreading in  Tanzania  as electoral authorities count the votes in a disputed presidential election that rights groups, opposition figures and others say was clouded by a climate of fear in the months leading to election day.\n \n\n   \n  The military has been deployed alongside the police to quell riots in major cities since Wednesday’s election. The sight of soldiers patrolling the streets, sporadic gunfire and closed stores is rare in the usually peaceful country that many foreigners visit for its pristine coastal beaches and safari tourism.\n \n\n   \n  That’s partly because Tanzania’s first female leader, who has served as president since 2021, has sparked widespread anger for  running virtually unopposed  after her two main opponents were blocked or prevented from contesting.\n \n\n   \n  President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who seeks five more years as president, ran against 16 candidates from smaller parties. Critics say that’s a coronation, not a contest. Hassan is now the subject of a range of uncharitable cartoons, posted on social media, derided as a dictator and lampooned as being afraid of competition.\n \n\n   \n  Tundu Lissu, leader of the Chadema opposition group, has been jailed for months, charged with treason after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from standing.\n \n\n   \n    Political maneuvering\n \n\n   \n  At stake for the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi party, or CCM, is its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hope to lead the country toward political change.\n \n\n   \n  The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, or ACLED, a nonprofit tracking violence and protest movements around the world, describes CCM as the “last of the hegemonic liberation parties,” trying to cling to power by blocking the opposition “through administrative, legal, and extra-legal means.”\n \n\n   \n  The pattern includes enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings, according to Amnesty International. In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited  more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019 , saying they were “alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression” ahead of elections.\n \n\n   \n  Internet access has been on and off since Wednesday as the nation awaits official results.\n \n\n   \n  Tanzania’s president has “overseen an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents,” the International Crisis Group said in its most recent analysis. “The government has curbed freedom of expression, ranging from a ban on X and restrictions on the Tanzanian digital platform JamiiForums to silencing critical voices through intimidation or arrest.”\n \n\n   \n  Local police even appeared to be “conducting so-called online patrols,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The political maneuvering by Tanzanian authorities is unprecedented even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multi-party politics in 1992.\n \n\n   \n  Government critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region.\n \n\n   \n  In Uganda, the opposition leader Bobi Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, is the leader of what began as the “People Power” movement, which aims for a break with nearly four decades of the same leader. President Yoweri Museveni took his lowest-ever share of the vote in the 2021 election, marking the 43-year-old Wine as a formidable national leader.\n \n\n   \n  In Kenya, young people have been trying to hold President William Ruto accountable over official corruption and his alleged failure to keep campaign promises. Last year and earlier this year, they held demonstrations in the capital Nairobi that were so large and persistent that Ruto deployed the military to restore order.\n \n\n   \n  In  Mozambique  a year ago, violence erupted in the streets after the opposition figure Venâncio Mondlane brought his supporters to the streets of the capital Maputo following a disputed election.\n \n\n   \n  In  Madagascar  earlier in October, protests by mostly young people helped overthrow the government of President Andry Rajoelina, who fled the country after an elite group of the military joined crowds protesting water and electricity cuts.\n \n\n   \n    Tanzania is an outlier\n \n\n   \n  But Tanzania is different, an outlier in the region.\n \n\n   \n  A version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since independence from Britain in 1961, a remarkable streak that Hassan is trying to extend as opposition leaders try to break CCM’s grip on the country.\n \n\n   \n  CCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or ten years. Hassan herself was able to rise to the presidency as vice president without incident when her predecessor, John Pombe Magufuli, died suddenly after the start of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  The orderly transition sustained Tanzania’s reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for CCM’s considerable support, especially among rural voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/tech/microsoft-amazon-meta-google-earnings-ai","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:05:00-04:00","title":"Big Tech Keeps Splurging on AI.

The pressure is ramping up to show why \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:05 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Silicon Valley’s mega AI spending spree isn’t slowing down anytime soon. But Wall Street’s patience to see a return might be wearing a little thin.\n \n\n   \n  That message rang clear when Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet all said this week that they’re forking over more   on capital expenditures, like   leases and equipment for data centers and infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the way analysts grilled executives from companies like Meta, Alphabet and Google on earnings calls this week, they’re eager for signs that these massive investments will pay off in a big way.\n \n\n   \n    AI spending continues to soar\n \n\n   \n  Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all grew their overall revenue year-over-year and surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. Microsoft and Google saw their cloud businesses expand by 40% and 34% respectively, while Amazon Web Services sales grew 20% year-over-year – a sign that companies are indeed relying on their services in the age of AI.\n \n\n   \n  And they’re continuing to pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and data centers, an investment they call necessary for the internet’s next era.\n \n\n   \n  The dollar amounts involved are staggering.\n \n\n   \n  Google expects to   spend $91 to $93 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, up from the $85 billion it previously forecast. Microsoft sees that spending   up 74%, to $34.9 billion this year, largely lining up with the more than $30 billion it predicted for the quarter. Meta spent $19.37 billion, up from $9.2 billion a year ago and more than the $18.4 billion analysts expected.\n \n\n   \n  And Amazon estimates the 2025 bill will hit $125 billion – and   expects to increase that in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Even Apple, which is not a major cloud provider, expects to increase its capital expenditure spending related to AI investments, Apple Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said on the company’s Thursday earnings call.\n \n\n   \n  Existing data centers need to be upgraded to handle AI workloads, leading to the giant outlays, said Melissa Otto, head of research for investment research service S&P Global Visible Alpha.\n \n\n   \n  Tech giants justify that spending by saying demand is outstripping supply. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “as fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”\n \n\n   \n    Wall Street wants big answers from Big Tech\n \n\n   \n  But Wall Street wants more than just promises of future returns. Meta shares fell as much as 13.5% on Thursday, while Microsoft’s were down more than 3%.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly every question on Meta’s earnings call focused on how the company views its AI investments translating into income, the timeline for new products and models coming out of its Superintelligence Lab and its general approach to AI.\n \n\n   \n  Zuckerberg called AI useful for powering virtual assistants and helping advertisers plan their campaigns. More than a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis, he said, adding that AI can lead to “all kinds of new products around different content formats.”\n \n\n   \n  “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it,” he said about the Superintelligence Lab’s efforts.\n \n\n   \n  On the Microsoft call, analysts wanted to know if clients will make good on promised purchasing commitments and whether the tech industry can really make money from global AI investments. Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said its investments reflect business that’s already been booked, saying that demand is increasing.\n \n\n   \n  Google investors wanted to know how AI summaries and agents are changing how the company makes money from search. Google’s chief business officer said the company makes about the same money from ads   below and within the AI responses as with traditional search.\n \n\n   \n  The answers satisfied some analysts; UBS said it maintains its “conviction that AI-related stocks should drive further equity performance,” while CFRA Research said it came away from the quarter “more optimistic” about Google’s core business and that Meta “remains committed to becoming the leading AI lab.” Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives said Microsoft is “hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front.”\n \n\n   \n  But that’s as long as they keep growing the products that catapulted them to become the world’s largest tech companies in the first place. Investors are more likely to raise their eyebrows at all this spending if customers start shying away from Meta’s social media apps or Google’s search engine, according to Otto.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re seeing a pressure to accelerate innovation,” said SuRo Capital’s Evan Schlossman. “You have new space in AI that people believe will be extremely valuable, and so there is a rush to sort of fill that void.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591497","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"14:43:00-04:00","title":"As SNAP benefits run dry, 'grocery buddies' are footing their neighbors' food bills","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown causes a pause in SNAP benefits—funding that supports about 42 million Americans—residents across the country have stepped up to help through an informal 'grocery buddy' system.

dry, 'grocery buddies' are footing their neighbors' food bills \n         By Juliana Kim \n        \n           Updated Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 2:43 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         For Alicia Spradley, it all started with a quick prayer. Spradley from Chicago had seen the news that federal food aid was pausing at the start of November due to the government shutdown. With local food banks  already stretched thin , she worried that her neighbors might soon go hungry. So, on Monday night, she closed her eyes and asked, \"What can I do to help?\" A few hours later, she came across a post on a Facebook community group about becoming a \"grocery buddy\" — someone who buys groceries for a stranger or anyone at risk of losing their food benefits. Without hesitation, Spradley wrote her own callout, offering support. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said funding has run dry for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — better known as SNAP or food stamps — past October. For nearly 42 million Americans who rely on the assistance, that means their debit-like EBT cards are at risk of not being refilled this month. Some states have committed funding to help fill the gap, but it's unclear how long the support can last. On Friday,  a federal judge ruled  that the USDA must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going and ordered an update by Monday. It remains unclear how the Trump administration will respond. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response to the limbo, there has been a wave of people nationwide on social media participating in an informal grocery buddy system until benefits are restored. Some \"buddies\" are sending gift cards, while others are shopping and dropping off groceries. In her neighborhood of Rogers Park, Spradley said more than two dozen people replied to her offer — some asking for help themselves, others pointing to friends or neighbors who need the support. \"I did not think that in just a short period of time that we would get that much interest,\" said Spradley, who also runs Plate & Pathways, a small nonprofit that works to combat food insecurity. SNAP is the largest anti-hunger program in the country. Most of its recipients are seniors, people with disabilities and families with children. Similarly, Spradley said many of the people who asked for her help were elderly or working families who struggled to find the time to visit a local food pantry. \"I'm glad that people have the courage to reach out and ask for help,\" she said. Hannah Coburn, a night-shift nurse in Spokane, Wash., felt the same way when she posted a callout on her private Facebook account. At first, most of the replies were from friends cheering on the idea. Then, a message popped up in her inbox: It was from an acquaintance she had met a few times at roller derby events. \"She said that it was really hard for her to reach out,\" Coburn said. \"It didn't even occur to me that she would be someone who would lose that.\" According to Coburn, the acquaintance said she had some money set aside for groceries but ended up using the funds for unexpected car repairs. Coburn's takeaway is that anyone could be relying on SNAP benefits and sometimes, the only way to find out who needs help is to offer it first. \" I hope that more people see that and get an idea of like, 'Oh, I could do something and maybe it could be helping somebody that I actually know,' \" she said. Others say they were motivated to step in because they had experienced financial hardship firsthand. Karie Fugett, an author from Dothan, Ala., said she grew up on food stamps and, later in life, faced periods of living in her car and not knowing where her next meal would come from. \"I am lucky right now to be able to afford groceries, afford my rent, all of that, but I haven't forgotten that in the past that wasn't the case and that people helped me,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Fugett is currently supporting two families on SNAP, totaling over $1,000. To do so, she said she plans to tap into funds that she saved to build her future house. \"I'll just figure out how to get that money back later,\" she said. \"I don't need it in this moment and other people need things in this moment, so that's a priority to me.\" Fugett also expressed frustration that families are at risk of going hungry as a result of lawmakers unable to reach an agreement to end the government shutdown. \"It's especially upsetting that it's because the people that we voted into office are not doing their job,\" she said. While grocery buddies offer immediate help, SNAP changes could cause long-term woes In North Carolina's Outer Banks, Micah Iverson, a project manager and musician, said he recently dropped off groceries for a single mother of four children in his community. The experience gave him a new perspective. \"I've never bought baby diapers before,\" he said. \"They're very expensive, in case you didn't know.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Iverson paid for the woman's groceries using a $300 gift card that he won at a trivia game. The night that he went to unload the bags into the woman's car, Iverson said they both were holding back tears. \" She kind of stopped me at the end and was like, 'I really didn't know what I was gonna do, so thank you,'\" he said. Although his gift card only lasted for one grocery trip, Iverson said he plans to check in and help out with groceries in a few weeks if SNAP remains stalled. \" We'll do this just until something changes,\" he said. The lapse in federal food and nutrition assistance isn't necessarily short-lived. Since the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July , SNAP has faced budget cuts and stricter eligibility rules. Starting this month, states must comply with new work requirements to qualify for the aid — a change that could leave  2.4 million people without benefits . Spradley in Chicago has been grappling with how to be a grocery buddy long-term. \" We're trying to figure this out as a community to make sure that we are not leaving anybody out and we are just coming up with things as we go,\" she said. Earlier this week, Spradley said she met with a mother who was panicking over how to feed her seven children this month. She handed the woman some cash — pooled from her wallet and donations — and what happened next surprised her. \" She's like, 'Anything that you know I can do to help you guys, let me know,'\" she said. \"And it just moves me because here is this person in need and they are still trying to be of service to the community.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:   The government shutdown and the current freeze in the anti-hunger program known as SNAP has left about 12% of the U.S. population with a potentially big gap in their grocery budgets. As lawmakers discuss potential solutions, some recipients are having their groceries paid for by neighbors and strangers who are footing the bill until the SNAP program is restored. It's part of a growing trend on social media. NPR's Juliana Kim reports. JULIANA KIM, BYLINE: Micah Iverson from Outer Banks, North Carolina, had just won a few hundred dollars at a trivia game when he heard about the SNAP freeze. Hours later, he saw on Facebook a friend pledging to cover groceries for anyone at risk of losing assistance. MICHA IVERSON: I saw that post, and I thought, well, I have 300 extra dollars. So let's get this started. KIM: Iverson wrote his own post. And soon after, he got a message from a woman saying... IVERSON: Hey. I have this neighbor. She's a single mom with four kids, and I think she is losing her SNAP benefits. KIM: When he reached out to the mom, he says she was shocked by the offer. Across the country, people have been participating in this informal system of grocery buddies amid fears that families who rely on SNAP may go hungry. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive the monthly benefit, most of whom are seniors, people with disabilities and families with children. When Hannah Coburn from Spokane, Washington, pledged to be a grocery buddy, she didn't realize she would be helping someone she's met at roller derby events. HANNAH COBURN: She had messaged me, and she said that it was really hard for her to reach out. KIM: The woman told Coburn she had money set aside for groceries but ended up needing it for unexpected car repairs. Coburn's takeaway is that anyone could be relying on SNAP benefits, and sometimes the only way to find out who needs help is to offer it first. In North Carolina, Iverson recently dropped off groceries to the mother of four. He says he couldn't help but choke up. IVERSON: She kind of stopped me at the end and was like, I really didn't know what I was going to do, so thank you. KIM: Iverson says he went in for a handshake and then... IVERSON: She was like, hug me, come on (laughter). This is very sweet of you. I was like, OK. KIM: That one grocery trip used up Iverson's entire gift card, but that doesn't mean he's done helping. He says if SNAP remains paused a few weeks from now, he'll check back in with the woman and buy more groceries. Juliana Kim, NPR News. PFEIFFER: If you or someone you know is in need of groceries during this uncertain period, The Emergency Food Assistance Program might be an option. It purchases food from farms and offers free monthly groceries to families who qualify. To find your local distribution sites, look up The Emergency Food Assistance Program in your state, then call or stop by a site to ask how to join. Meanwhile, two federal judges ruled on Friday that cutting off SNAP benefits is unlawful. They've given the Trump administration until tomorrow to come up for a plan to how to proceed.

It caught even some advisers by surprise. \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:12 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Chinese leader Xi Jinping inserted a reference to “twists and turns” in his relationship with  President Donald Trump  in the opening remarks of their summit this week, he could hardly have imagined the twist that came minutes before the talks began.\n \n\n   \n  Writing from Marine One, which was gliding toward the airport in South Korea where he was due to meet Xi, Trump  instructed the Pentagon  to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing other nations’ — including China’s — own capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  “That process will begin immediately,” the president wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  The directive took even many of Trump’s advisers off guard, according to officials, leading to unanswered questions about when, or if, the testing would actually begin. Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.\n \n\n   \n  Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”\n \n\n   \n  “To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked by reporters in Malaysia on Friday about Trump’s post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon would move quickly and work with the Department of Energy. He argued that “resuming testing is a pretty responsible” way to keep a “credible nuclear deterrent.”\n \n\n   \n  Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n  A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”\n \n\n   \n  He seemed less cautious in his  Truth Social message  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.\n \n\n   \n  “With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”\n \n\n   \n  If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.\n \n\n   \n  “The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.\n \n\n   \n  In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.\n \n\n   \n  In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”\n \n\n   \n  “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.\n \n\n   \n  “If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96296","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"01:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration faces Monday deadline on use of contingency funds for SNAP","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration faces a critical Monday deadline in November 2025 to respond to federal court orders requiring the continuation of SNAP funding during the government shutdown.

The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation's social safety net — and it costs about $8 billion per month nationally. The situation leaves millions with uncertainty about how they will feed themselves. Benefits will be delayed in November regardless of the outcome of the court cases because many beneficiaries have their cards recharged early in the month and the process of loading cards can take a week or more in many states. Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions. Cities and nonprofits also filed a lawsuit. On Friday, judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts ruled separately that the administration must continue to pay for SNAP. They both gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the program partially or in full for November. The USDA has a $5 billion contingency fund for the program, but the Trump administration reversed an earlier agency plan to use that money to keep SNAP running. Democratic officials argue that the administration could also use a separate fund of about $23 billion. U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, said SNAP must be funded using at least contingency funds, and he asked for an update on progress by Monday. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said all previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored. During the shutdown, the USDA has terminated existing waivers that exempted work requirements for older adults, veterans and others. In Boston, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled the suspension was unlawful and said USDA has to pay for SNAP. Talwani ordered the federal government to advise by Monday whether they will use emergency reserve funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the program using both contingency funds and additional available funds. Advocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills. The majority of states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the SNAP debit cards. To qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four's net income after certain expenses can't exceed the federal poverty line, which is about $32,000 per year.

The commonwealth's gubernatorial race — one of just two held the year after presidential elections — is often seen as a temperature check on how voters feel about leaders in Washington. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee and former congresswoman, has maintained a lead in polls since very early in the race over Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. But this year, while  voters' top concerns  are energy prices, housing affordability and jobs, the rest of the race has become a referendum on everything from political violence to redistricting. Here, public media journalists across Virginia take us into each issue. DOGE and the federal government shutdown The challenges  facing Virginia's 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors came long before the Oct. 1 government shutdown. Earlier this year, during Elon Musk's DOGE efforts, thousands of Virginians were laid off. Democrats in the commonwealth hope that voter anger over the firings and furloughs will carry them to victory on Tuesday night. On the campaign trail, Spanberger talks about sticking up for federal workers in the face of the \"chaos from Washington.\" At a campaign event Thursday, Spanberger put it this way: \"The stakes of this election are serious.\" As furloughs stretch into a second month, Virginia Republicans have also seen a political opening in the shutdown. \"My opponent, all summer long, has been playing political football with federal workers by trying to say that she loves them more than anyone else,\" Earle-Sears said on the debate stage, and then criticized Spanberger for encouraging Democrats in Congress to resist any funding deal that doesn't include continuing health care subsidies. But Earle-Sears hasn't shied away from the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce. She has said she believes claims of \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" and argues that the impact of layoffs in Virginia will be minimal due to the economic strength she and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin have stewarded over the previous four years. Political violence A scandal in the race for attorney general has reverberated up the ticket. Early last month,  text messages from 2022  show Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general and a former member of the Virginia legislature, describing hypothetical violence against a political opponent. Earle-Sears and other Republican candidates have tried to tie the text messages to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, painting Democrats as politically violent. Spanberger condemned the messages and political violence generally, but didn't withdraw or double down on her endorsement of Jones. \"It is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information,\" she said in the gubernatorial debate. Jones' Republican opponent, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, is appealing to Spanberger voters to split their tickets. Redistricting  Democrats in the Virginia legislature threw another wrench into the campaign last week by calling a surprise series of meetings after North Carolina became another state to redraw its congressional map to favor the GOP at the behest of President Trump. On Friday, the Virginia legislature proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms. Because it needs to be approved by legislators again next year before voters can finalize the amendment next spring, its success depends on Spanberger winning her race and Democrats maintaining control of the House of Delegates. How much the redistricting plan changes voters' minds is up for debate. Close to a million voters cast their ballots before the Democrats announced their plan, while the redistricting session took delegates off the trail during the final full week of campaigning. Earle-Sears, who presides over the state Senate in her role as lieutenant governor, was also called back to Richmond. She still managed to hold events  around the state , and a press conference on the steps of the Virginia Capitol, while a small crowd held \"Winsome For Governor\" signs. Spanberger has made few public comments about redistricting, beyond signalling her  general support . Transgender youth Republicans up and down the ballot have made Virginia's transgender youth a major campaign issue. The argument over transgender athletes and bathrooms in Virginia schools really took off when Republican Glenn Youngkin made it a focus of his 2021 campaign for governor. Arguably, it helped him become the first GOP governor elected in more than a decade. But, despite Republicans spending millions on ads around transgender students in 2025,  recent polling  shows it's a top concern for 3 percent of voters. The economy and countering Trump's policies are at the forefront of most voters' minds. Spanberger has said she likely leads on the subject because Republicans have been \"villainizing kids.\" \"Particularly efforts to heavily politicize a group of kids who need a bit of grace, and the adults around them to show thoughtfulness,\" the former congresswoman said. \"I'm not taking a stand because it's the easy thing to do. Of course, it's not easy. I'm being abused for it,\" Earle-Sears  said , comparing her support for cisgender students to the civil rights movement.

For many, he's now a national leader \n         By Elena Moore \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It's been years since Democratic voter Lea Ash felt hopeful about a politician, but that changed recently. \"He's been really the only bright spot for me this year,\" she said. \"[He] wants to listen to the people he's seeking to govern.\" The 26-year-old is referring to Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York, who has centered his campaign on affordability concerns. For that reason, he easily has Ash's vote — if only   she lived in the city he was running in. Instead, she lives more than 1,200 miles away. \"I would like to believe one day there could be a Zohran Mamdani for Gulfport, Miss., but I don't think that's ever going to happen, at least not in my lifetime,\" Ash said, acknowledging her state's deep conservative roots. \"But it gives me hope that it can happen in other places across the country.\" In just a few months, Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assemblyman and Democratic Socialist, has gone from a long-shot fringe candidate to a national figure — securing an upset win in the   June primary, where voters 18-29 had the  highest turnout of any age group .  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Now, on the cusp of Election Day — where polls show him the clear frontrunner over his closest rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo — Mamdani is counting on that youth coalition to show up again. But his pledge to address rising costs appears to be resonating with young people far outside of the five boroughs. It's a message that many Gen Z and millennials say speaks to  their most pressing concerns  at a time when many feel hopeless about their leaders and yearn for new voices willing to break with political norms. \"When a candidate is able to speak to the concerns of the populace and validate those concerns … I think that that has a big impact, especially when it comes to young people,\" said Ruby Belle Booth, who studies young voters for the nonpartisan research organization CIRCLE. \"They really feel heard and like they're being respected,\" she added. \"I think any candidate can do that and have success. But right now it's Mamdani and maybe before that, it was [President] Trump.\" A local movement for Mamdani has gone national Despite living in ruby red Mississippi, Ash says she's always voted for Democrats. However, in recent years, she's grown frustrated and ignored by political leaders. It's a feeling exacerbated by her own economic situation. The pandemic cut her college experience short, and she struggled to find work, forcing her to move back home. Now, years later, even with a job, she's unable to afford her own place. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Giving up on that goal, she says, was a hard pill to swallow. \"When [my mom] was in her twenties, she was married, and she and my dad owned a house by this point, and I can't even afford to rent in a city in Mississippi,\" she said, adding that she's seen  housing prices increase  despite the state having one of the  highest poverty rates  in the country. \"It's a little demoralizing.\" But Ash hopes, if Mamdani wins, it'll send a message to Democrats in other cities around the country to take issues like housing affordability more seriously. A focus on the economy and breaking the status quo  Mamdani has campaigned on a slew of promises, particularly  around housing  — notably, he's vowing to freeze the rent for rent-stabilized units and build 200,000 new apartments for low and middle-income New Yorkers. Those proposals are part of his larger,  ambitious platform aimed at cutting prices , ranging from creating city-run grocery stores to making city buses and childcare free. His critics on the left say these ideas are unrealistic — even in a liberal bastion like New York City. Among conservatives, including Trump, Mamdani's views have been characterized as extreme or dangerous. Those warnings, however, don't seem to be fazing many young Americans, who appear most drawn to his message over any political label from either Democrats or the GOP. \"Mamdani is this candidate who is actively challenging the status quo in a lot of ways rather than representing it,\" said Booth. She points to  a CIRCLE survey  from this spring that found that just 16% of those under 30 believe Democracy is working for them, which Booth argues isn't indicative that these voters are thrilled by politics as usual. Although they hold vastly different ideologies, Booth argues Trump tapped into a similar anti-establishment mentality last year. Economic concerns were the top issue for those 18-29 last fall, and voters who prioritized the economy were also more likely to vote for the president,  according to a CIRCLE analysis of 2024 AP VoteCast data . \"I think that young people, we've seen, are not really thinking about politics in terms of those two parties and are evaluating it more in terms of the issues that they really care about,\" Booth said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Affordability concerns should cross party lines, argues 26-year-old Democrat Emily Wilson. Based in St. Petersburg, Fla., she's also supporting Mamdani from afar, and says she often talks politics with her colleagues at the spa where they work. \"Grocery prices and bus prices and rent prices, these are issues affecting both Democrats and Republicans,\" Wilson said. Though she acknowledges that some people could see Mamdani's candidacy as too radical outside of New York, she argues that a similar economic message could be effective when delivered by a candidate who knows the community. \"I think if a Floridian or a Texan were to talk about the same issues that Zohran [is talking about], I think he would have the same appeal,\" she said. Up north in a small town near Ann Arbor, Mich., Daisy Lupa, 25, feels similarly. As someone who has begrudgingly backed national Democrats in recent years, she says Mamdani's campaign is refreshing, and believes many of his proposals could help communities like hers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think that a lot of stuff that he is trying to push forward in New York … are things that we need even more in rural areas and even more in the Midwest because we don't have it at all,\" she said. \"It's flawed in New York,\" she added. \"It's absent here.\" Cautious optimism Of course, a central question for those who actually can vote in the New York mayor's race is whether Mamdani can truly solve the affordability crisis. For Dillon Robertson, 32, money is a constant worry. He commutes to college in Connecticut and will graduate with close to $250,000 in student loans. He's supporting Mamdani and says many of his cost-saving proposals could make his life easier, but at the same time, he worries if it's all possible. \"A lot of the stuff he says sounds nice. But I both wonder, can he do it? Can he pull it off?\" he said. \"Or [is] it just kind of like a Band-Aid on a leaky ship?\" Still, he admits, if the options are to keep plodding along or try something new, he's ready to give it a shot. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5594899","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-20:26","title":"Israel Says It Received Remains of 3 Hostages from Gaza as Fragile Ceasefire Holds","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 2, 2025, Israel announced it had received the remains of three hostages from Gaza, with Hamas claiming the bodies were found in a tunnel in southern Gaza.

received remains of 3 hostages from Gaza as fragile ceasefire holds \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 8:26 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         JERUSALEM — Israel on Sunday announced that the remains of three hostages had been handed over from Gaza and would be examined by forensic experts, as a fragile  month-old ceasefire held . A Hamas statement earlier said the remains were found Sunday in a tunnel in southern Gaza. Since the ceasefire took effect on Oct. 10, Palestinian militants had released the remains of 17 hostages, with 11 remaining in Gaza, before Sunday's handover. Israel's military said official identification of these remains would be provided to families first. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. President Donald Trump later on Sunday indicated that the remains of Omer Neutra, an American-Israeli citizen, were among the hostages returned by Hamas. The president said he has spoken with the family of Neutra, who served as a tank platoon commander in the Israel Defense Forces. Israeli officials have said they believed Neutra, a Long Island, New York native, was killed in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that sparked the war. \"They were thrilled, in one sense, but in another sense, obviously, it's not too great,\" Trump said of Neutra's parents. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Militants have released one or two bodies every few days. Israel has urged faster progress, and in certain cases it has said the remains aren't of any hostage. Hamas has said the work is complicated by widespread devastation. Emotions around the remains have been high among families, who continue to rally weekly. On Saturday night, Moran Harari, a friend of the late Carmel Gat, urged Israel to have restraint. \"This cursed war has taken so many lives of dear people on both sides of the fence. This time, we must not fall into it again,\" Harari said during a rally in Jerusalem. Israel in turn has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians for the return of the remains of an Israeli hostage. Health officials in Gaza have struggled to identify bodies without access to DNA kits. Only 75 of the 225 Palestinian bodies returned since the ceasefire began have been identified, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which has posted photos of remains in the hope that families will recognize them. The exchange has been the central part of the initial phase of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire. The 20-point plan includes the formation of an international stabilization force of Arab and other partners that would work with Egypt and Jordan on securing Gaza's borders and ensure the ceasefire is respected. Multiple nations have shown interest in taking part in a peacekeeping force but called for a clear U.N. Security Council mandate before committing troops. Other difficult questions include Hamas' disarmament and the governance of a postwar Gaza, as well as when and how humanitarian aid will be increased. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier Sunday that \"there are still pockets of Hamas\" in parts of Gaza controlled by Israeli forces. \"There are actually two in Rafah and Khan Younis, and they will be eliminated,\" Netanyahu said during a Cabinet meeting. The deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas began with the Hamas-led 2023 attack that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others hostage. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 68,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts. Israel, which has denied accusations by a U.N. commission of inquiry and others of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the ministry's figures without providing a contradicting toll. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5535648","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"The Declining Population Will Make It Even Harder to Care for Elders","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. population ages and birth rates decline, the burden of elder care is intensifying.

     By Kristin Wright, Marisa Peñaloza \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Sunday \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON, D.C. — Maurice White, 75, and Renee DeVigne, 68, are among the millions of family caregivers in the U.S. whose lives center around caring for aging loved ones. The Washington, D.C. couple has gone to extraordinary lengths, into their own retirement years, to take care of family elders. They've cared for White's mother Evelyn White in their home for 25 years. The retired teacher turned 104 in October. She's one of the last of their elders they will care for. \"There have been 12,\" said DeVigne. \"His father, my mother, and other aunts, uncles, grandparents.\" The couple also helps care for DeVigne's dad, who lives in a memory care facility. While people are living longer, they're also having fewer children,  according to the United Nations . In the U.S., this population shift means caring for parents, grandparents, and other relatives could become even more challenging with fewer family members to pitch in. The caregiving industry is already experiencing a workforce shortage. The   decline in the birth rate  may reshape how we think about caring for the oldest Americans. Multigenerational living Maurice White and DeVigne say they know many families can't keep loved ones at home for various reasons. Some are juggling the demands of jobs and parenthood. White retired early — 20 years ago — and the couple doesn't have children. Some families may not have enough space in their homes. White built an apartment in their basement for his mother. He says their culture as a Black family plays an important role in their decision to provide care at home. \"I do think that African-American families have more of a tendency to do that, many because of money, but more just because of the family connection,\" he said. \"This is my mom. We put her to bed every night and say prayers with her.\" According to  Pew Research Center , about 26% of Black and Hispanic Americans, and 24% of Asian Americans lived in multigenerational households compared to 13% of white Americans in 2021. And the  Bureau of Labor Statistics  says from 2021-2022, 45% of Black elder care providers were taking care of a parent. For Hispanics or Latinos, that same figure was about half. Ai-jen Poo is Executive Director of Caring Across Generations and President of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. She says the U.S. is nearing a tipping point with families overwhelmed by caregiving demands. \"We've kind of taken this model of care where you're on your own and you're expected to shoulder and manage it as an individual or as families alone,\" she said. \"We've taken this model to its very limit and we're all at the edge of the cliff looking down and wondering what to do next.\" White and DeVigne took care of his mother Evelyn without assistance until she started needing more support a couple of years ago. Then, they hired home health aide Selisa Sutton. \"I'm like family. I call her my auntie,\" said Sutton, 52. Evelyn was out for mile-long walks. \"She was bathing herself, brushing her teeth, getting herself dressed, she'd ride her bike, we'd go to the senior citizen center everyday!\" But this summer, everything changed. Evelyn had a stroke. She was in the hospital for nine days and then started short-term rehab at Knollwood Life Plan Community, a senior living community in Washington, D.C. Workforce shortages and rising cost of care Knollwood is among many care facilities that have had to navigate the strain of workforce shortages. Beverly Morgan, a registered nurse and director of Sales and Marketing at the center says she's concerned about these shortages because it's projected to grow worse nationally. \"The shortage was an issue 10 years before the pandemic. Then, you had this horrific pandemic that took a large portion of people out of the system,\" she said. The Trump Administration's immigration policies are also expected to   deepen the strain .   Immigrants make up  more than a fourth of professional direct long-term care workers. The median cost of a home health aide for 40 hours a week was more than $68,000 a year in 2023, according to  KFF , an independent health policy research, polling and news organization headquartered in the D.C. area. The median annual price tag for a private bedroom in assisted living exceeded $64,000. Assisted living support at Knollwood starts at about $89,000 a year. Families typically must pay out-of-pocket or use long-term care insurance for both types of care. Congress has made cuts to Medicaid, as more than 700,000 aging adults, people with disabilities, and those with chronic conditions are   on waitlists  to receive Medicaid home and community-based care in dozens of states. \"If we're living an average of 20 years longer … we've got to re-imagine a system of care and a culture of caregiving,\" said Poo. Human connection is key  Maurice White and Renee DeVigne's advice for people who want to care for loved ones at home is to learn as much as possible about their elders' needs and resources.    \"Research, research, research,\" said White. \"You try to do your due diligence to gather your facts and learn and ask questions,\" said DeVigne. \"I try to surround myself with people who know more than I do.\" Over the years, the couple has done workshops on spirituality and self-care. They say they've also incorporated meditation and other techniques to promote mental and emotional well being. DeVigne says the family's prayers were answered. After weeks of rehab, Evelyn White returned home. \"We're proud of you, Mom, because you've worked very hard,\" said DeVigne. \"It's hard to do rehab in the best of times, but at 104, you're an inspiration to us all.\" Evelyn says she's grateful for her life, and all the care and love she gets from her son and daughter-in-law. They say, over all these years, she has passed down to them her philosophy on life. \"Being nice to everyone and being appreciative of the things that are done for you,\" said White. Since returning home, her family says she has gotten positive reports from her doctors. White is rebuilding some strength in physical and occupational therapy, and she's back at the senior center. The family is reflecting on their experience at Knollwood in the facility-care system. It has given them new perspective and made them think differently about the future. White and DeVigne say they're still figuring out what type of care and care setting they want for themselves. The one thing they know they need and want is human connection. \"I've always said I'd stay in my house until the day I died,\" said White. \"But it dawned on me, you can be isolated all the time. I think that's one of the things that's helped mom, she has never been isolated. We keep her going and it made a difference. It kept her alive!\" The couple's hope is that the country can solve the caregiving crisis and be ready for shifts in the population. They imagine a day when families can afford care, the professional workforce is valued with better wages, and elders get the care they deserve. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:   The caregiving industry is already struggling with a workforce shortage. Add to that, the fact that Americans are living longer and having fewer children. It's a population shift that means more people are growing into old age than people coming up behind them. In this report, NPR's Kristin Wright puts those two together - the decline in the birth rate and how that may reshape how we think about caring for the oldest Americans. KRISTIN WRIGHT, BYLINE: A retired school teacher sits in her black-and-white striped blazer and pearls, ready for a party in her honor. She smiles when you catch her eye. EVELYN G WHITE: My name is Evelyn G. White. WRIGHT: White is celebrating another birthday. She's 104 and grateful for her life and all the care and love she gets from her son, Maurice White, and his wife, Renee DeVigne. We ask if he's her only son. E WHITE: As far as I know. (LAUGHTER) WRIGHT: The couple has been caring for White at home for 25 years. They think she's one of the last of many they've cared for. RENEE DEVIGNE: There's been 12. MAURICE WHITE: There's my dad. DEVIGNE: You know, his father, my mother, other aunts, uncles, grandparents. WRIGHT: They took care of White on their own until just a couple of years ago when she started needing more support. The family began hiring home health aides and found Selisa Sutton. SELISA SUTTON: I'm like family. I call her my auntie. WRIGHT: Sutton says White was usually very active, going out for mile-long walks. SUTTON: She was bathing herself, brushing her teeth, getting herself dressed. She would ride her bike. We'd go to the senior citizens center every day. WRIGHT: But one day this summer, things changed. White had a stroke. She couldn't move her left side. She was in the hospital for nine days and then had to go to rehab at Knollwood senior living community in Washington, D.C., before she could go back home. Sutton still sings gospel music to her every day. SUTTON: (Singing) This is the day. This is the day that the Lord has made, that the Lord has made. WRIGHT: White is surrounded by Sutton and her family. She sits at a table in the dining room at Knollwood for the celebration. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WRIGHT: The room is decorated with balloons, the tables set with white and royal blue linens and pink flowers. Sunlight streams through the windows. Six women are being honored. They've made it to 100. White's family says she's passed down to them her philosophy on life. E WHITE: Being nice to everybody and being appreciative of the things that are done for you. WRIGHT: Being nice and appreciative - her son says that's the way he was raised. So he and his wife insisted that Mom, who was a widow, move in with them all those years ago. It took a while to convince her, but she quickly adjusted. M WHITE: She said to me, this is the best thing I've ever done in my whole life. I don't have to worry about the roof, the heating, the - nothing. And we were so relieved 'cause I was really worried that we had pushed her into something she didn't want. WRIGHT: They know many families can't keep loved ones home. The couple never had children of their own. They shuffled back and forth from house to house most days, tending to their elders while working and built an apartment in their basement for White. Maurice White says as a Black family, culture plays a role. M WHITE: I do think that African-American families have more of a tendency to do that - many because of money but more just because of the family connection. It's just this is my mom. We put her to bed every night and say prayers with her. WRIGHT: According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, about a quarter of Black, Asian and Hispanic-Americans - the term used by Pew - live in multigenerational households like theirs. Like so many, Maurice White and Renee DeVigne wish they had a senior-care blueprint. They're still learning how to care for White as she gets older. M WHITE: And it's a gradual process. I mean, every week or every month, something changes. Mom had been fixing her own food, and then it got to the point where it started to be an issue. WRIGHT: And now things are changing again since the stroke. Walking is harder than it used to be, and White will have to sleep in a hospital bed when she gets home from rehab. This is the couple's advice for people who want to care for their loved ones at home. M WHITE: Research, research, research. WRIGHT: White has long-term care insurance, but her family still had to shift some things around, like selling property to cover some of her care... DEVIGNE: You try to do your due diligence to gather your facts and learn and ask questions. WRIGHT: ...And finding people like Sutton who love caring for others. SUTTON: How you feel, Ms. White? E WHITE: Good. Feeling good. WRIGHT: Even with an experienced, dedicated caregiver who comes into their home, there are many hard days. The couple has taken workshops to help manage the stress and emotions. DeVigne shares this release technique. SUTTON: If you are driving in your car, you blast your radio or your music. You're screaming at the top of your lungs. You just scream. WRIGHT: Millions of families across the country are feeling the frustration too. The cost of care keeps rising, and cuts to Medicaid and yearslong state waiting lists for home and community-based care leave many with few options. And at this rate, population shifts will mean more older people and fewer caregivers. BEVERLY MORGAN: My concern is the nursing shortage. WRIGHT: Beverly Morgan is the head of marketing at Knollwood, where White went for stroke rehab. Morgan's been a registered nurse for 30 years. MORGAN: There's a physician shortage. There's a physical therapy - I mean, health care professionals are dwindling. WRIGHT: It got worse at the height of the pandemic, and the Trump administration's immigration policies are expected to put more strain on the care workforce. Immigrants make up almost a third of professional, direct, long-term care workers. Beverly Morgan wonders how older people will get the care they need in the future. MORGAN: I'm not so sure as a country how we're going to be able to meet those needs when the population of people are growing but the professionals that are going to be able to serve them are not. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: One, two, three... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. WRIGHT: At the party, the honorees get bouquets of pink roses, including Evelyn White. (SOUNDBITE OF PAPER CRINKLING) E WHITE: Thank you so much. WRIGHT: She says the celebration was moving. E WHITE: It was wonderful. I thought it was so nice. I'm blessed. WRIGHT: Blessed, she says. DeVigne says the family's prayers have been answered. After weeks of rehab, White's going home. DEVIGNE: We're proud of you, Mom, because you've worked very hard here. It's hard to do rehab in the best of times, but at 104, you're an inspiration to us all. E WHITE: Thank you. Ain't that nice? WRIGHT: Generations to come will make hard decisions about how to care for their elders. Some days, White's son, who's 75 and daughter-in-law, who's 68 - both retired - talk about who will take care of them and where. M WHITE: I've always said I'd stay in my house until the day I died. WRIGHT: The couple agrees they have more talking to do, but they do know they'll always need human connection. M WHITE: Then it dawned on me, but then you can kind of be isolated all the time. And I think that's one of the things that's helped Mom. She's never been isolated, and it made a difference. It kept her alive. WRIGHT: Maurice White and Renee DeVigne's hope is that the country can solve the caregiving crisis and be ready for shifts in the population so that families can afford care, professional workers are valued with better wages and aging family members get the care they deserve.

    Trump is leaning into his crackdown on city crime. The GOP sees it as a winning issue \n         By Franco Ordoñez \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump threatened to deploy more troops to U.S. cities this week — and not just the National Guard — as part of what he describes as his national crackdown on crime. Speaking to U.S. troops aboard an aircraft carrier in Japan, Trump said he planned to expand his crime and immigration offensive because \"we have cities in trouble.\" \"We're sending in our National Guard, and if we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard, because we're going to have safe cities,\" Trump said, aboard the USS George Washington at the Yokosuka Naval Base. \"We're not going to have people killed in our cities. And whether people like that or not, that's what we're doing.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The White House has transformed what started as a focused effort, purportedly meant to address crime in Washington, D.C. into a nationwide campaign to portray Trump and the Republicans as unabashed crime fighters while painting Democrats as coddlers of crime. Violent crime in the city was at a 30-year low prior to the Guard's arrival. Trump has also deployed troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, Tenn., and Portland, Ore, which has triggered protests and lawsuits. Democratic leaders have accused the White House of exaggerating the challenges in order to launch an illegal military occupation. But Trump is banking on the moves helping him and Republicans in next year's midterms. At a cabinet meeting in August, Trump called crime a stronger issue for Republicans to run on than transgender athletes in school sports and possibly even immigration. \"Crime is probably the issue that he fares best on, certainly better than handling inflation or trade or even international relations, despite some of the successes that he's had recently,\" said Jon McHenry, a Republican pollster with North Star Opinion Research. Political data points to a clear opportunity for Trump and the Republicans. Though FBI data show that violent crime decreased by 4.5 percent last year, a  new Gallup poll released Thursday shows  almost half of Americans — 49 percent — feel that crime has risen from last year — while about a third — or 33 percent — feel crime has gone down. The Gallup poll also reveals some political risks for Trump. More Americans oppose using federal troops to combat domestic crime than support the move — but the divide is largely along political lines, as Republicans overwhelmingly support the use of troops while Democrats are opposed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Crime shouldn't be looked at through a partisan lens, but Trump has tapped into one of the most basic quality of life issues, said Jillian Snider, a member of the Council on Criminal Justice and retired New York police officer. She said most people do not look online to see if crime is up or down. They instead walk down the street. \"That is the real problem here, that general community members, they don't care as much to be schooled by what the stats show us,\" said Snider, who also teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"They just care about how they feel in their communities.\" Republicans have long leaned into law and order, but veteran political strategist Alex Conant says Trump embraces the issue in an unprecedented way when you look at troops in cities. \"He told his base he was going to get crime in American cities under control. And now, when you turn on the TV at night, U.S. troops are trying to do exactly that,\" Conant said. \"Now, obviously, there's going to be a lot of opposition to it, especially amongst Democrats, people who live in some of those neighborhoods. But this is what he told his base he would do, and now he's delivering it. And, he's proud of it.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:   President Trump threatened this past week to deploy more troops throughout the country as part of what he describes as a crackdown on crime. He spoke to US troops in Japan and argued he has to do this to save American cities. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're sending in our National Guard, and if we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard because we're going to have safe cities. We're not going to have people killed in our cities. And whether people like that or not, that's what we're doing.

FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: President Trump made a rare visit this summer to the White House briefing room to announce he was deploying hundreds of national guard troops to Washington, D.C. And he told a story about growing up in New York City and going out to eat with his late father, Fred Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: He used to say, son, when you walk into a restaurant and you see a dirty front door, don't go in, because if the front door is dirty, the kitchen's dirty also. ORDOÑEZ: Ignoring the fact that violent crime in Washington, D.C., is at a 30-year low, Trump promised to crack down on the, quote, \"bloodthirsty criminals,\" clean up trash and clear out the homelessness. He appeared to be evangelizing the widely criticized broken windows theory, which contends that failing to address smaller problems like smashed windows leads to bigger problems and more serious crimes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Same thing with the Capitol. If our capital's dirty, our whole country is dirty. ORDOÑEZ: But what started out as a focused effort in Washington, D.C., has since transformed into a nationwide campaign to present Trump and the Republicans as unabashed crime fighters, while painting Democrats as coddlers of crime. Trump has now deployed troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, Tennessee, and Portland, Oregon. Democrats have cried foul. Leaders have accused the White House of launching an illegal military occupation. Meanwhile, Trump says Democrats have fallen into a political trap that will only pay off for Republicans in next year's midterm elections. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: But I would say that crime is stronger than men playing in women's sports. I think it's stronger than transgender for everybody. You know, transgender for everybody, according to them - it's stronger. Of course, it's - this is the cause of it - open borders. ORDOÑEZ: Jillian Snider of the Council on Criminal Justice and a retired New York police officer says Trump has tapped into one of the most basic quality-of-life issues. Crime shouldn't be looked at through partisan lines, she says. If people don't feel safe, they don't feel safe, no matter what anyone tells them. JILLIAN SNIDER: That is the real problem here, that general community members - they don't care as much to be schooled by what the stats show us. They just care about how they feel in their communities (ph). ORDOÑEZ: And the political data points to a clear opportunity for Trump and the Republicans. A new Gallup poll released this week shows almost half of Americans - 49% - feel that crime has risen from last year, while about a third - or 33% - feel crime has gone down. The FBI says actual violent crime has decreased by 4.5% last year. The Gallup poll also cites some risks for Trump. More Americans oppose using federal troops to combat domestic crime, but the divide is largely along political lines, as Republicans overwhelmingly support the use of troops while Democrats are opposed. ALEX CONANT: Trump views cracking down on crime as a huge political winner, and historically, he's right. ORDOÑEZ: Veteran political strategist Alex Conant says Republicans have long leaned into law and order. But Trump embraces it in an unprecedented way, when you look at troops in cities. CONANT: But it's hard to argue that it's not a political winner form with independents, suburban voters and his base, you know, the very people that elected him. ORDOÑEZ: And he says, while Democrats don't want to condone Trump's policies, they need to be careful how they condemn the actions, especially if they lead to voters feeling safer.

in a plaza in front of dozens of people who had gathered for Day of the Dead festivities, authorities said. Local politicians in Mexico are frequently victims of political and organized crime violence. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The mayor of the Uruapan municipality, Carlos Alberto Manzo Rodríguez, was gunned down Saturday night in the town's historic center. He was rushed to a hospital, where he later died, according to state prosecutor Carlos Torres Piña. A city council member and a bodyguard were also injured in the attack. The attacker was killed at the scene, Federal Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch told journalists Sunday. The attack on the mayor was carried out by an unidentified man who shot him seven times, García Harfuch said. The weapon was linked to two armed clashes between rival criminal groups operating in the region, he added. \"No line of investigation is being ruled out to clarify this cowardly act that took the life of the mayor,\" García Harfuch said. Michoacan is one of Mexico's most violent states and is a battleground among various cartels and criminal groups fighting for control of territory, drug distribution routes and other illicit activities. On Sunday, hundreds of Uruapan residents, dressed in black and holding up photographs of Manzo Rodríguez, took to the town's streets to accompany the funeral procession and bid farewell to the slain mayor. They chanted \"Justice! Justice! Out with Morena!,\" a reference to the ruling party of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. In recent months, the Uruapan mayor had publicly appealed to Sheinbaum on social media for help to confront the cartels and criminal groups. He had accused Michoacan's pro-government governor, Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla, and the state police of corruption. At the head of the procession, a man led Manzo Rodríguez's black horse, with one of the mayor's signature hats placed on the saddle. A group of musicians, also dressed in black, followed and played mariachi songs. In the narrow streets of the agricultural town, where avocados are the main crop, dozens of police and military officers stood guard around the area. The attack on Manzo Rodríguez, a former Morena legislator, was captured on video and shared on social media. The footage shows dozens of residents and tourists, some in costume and with painted faces, enjoying the event surrounded by hundreds of lit candles, marigold flowers and skull decorations. Then several gunshots ring out and people run for cover. In another video, a person is seen lying on the ground as an official performs CPR while armed police officers guard the area. Manzo Rodríguez had been under protection since December 2024, three months after taking office. His security was reinforced last May with municipal police and 14 National Guard officers, García Harfuch said, without specifying what prompted the measure. Manzo Rodríguez, who some nicknamed \"The Mexican Bukele\" in reference to the tough security policies of El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, took office as mayor of Uruapan after winning that year's midterm elections with an independent movement. The mayor's killing follows the death of Salvador Bastidas, mayor of the municipality of Tacambaro, also in Michoacan. Bastidas was killed in June along with his bodyguard as he arrived at his home in the town's Centro neighborhood. In October 2024, journalist Mauricio Cruz Solís was also shot in Uruapan shortly after interviewing Manzo Rodríguez. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5594866","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"19:02:00-05:00","title":"In Chicago, a Halloween weekend of immigration arrests and violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the Halloween weekend in 2025, heightened immigration enforcement in Chicago under 'Operation Midway Blitz' led to widespread fear, canceled celebrations, and violent clashes near Evanston's middle school, where an immigration agent was accused of assaulting a man.

celebrations, with residents reporting a noticeable decline in festivities. At least one Halloween parade was  canceled . \"There were a lot less parades,\" Ernesto, a resident of a largely Latino Chicago neighborhood, told NPR. He requested his last name be withheld, out of fear of his employer retaliating against him for speaking to the media. \"The fear,\" he says, \"has been more palpable with each passing day.\" Last week, Democratic Illinois  Gov. JB Pritzker  called for federal agents to pause \"Operation Midway Blitz\" (the Chicago immigration enforcement campaign) during the Halloween weekend. \"If you are unwilling to cease operations and leave our city, can we at least agree that our children should not be victims, especially on Halloween?\" Pritzker asked. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the request \"shameful.\" \"We're absolutely not willing to put on pause any work that we will do to keep communities safe,\"  she responded in a press conference . On Friday, clashes between protesters and immigration agents erupted near a middle school in Evanston, a suburb north of Chicago. Witnesses  shared  video  footage  of an agent holding a man down and repeatedly hitting him in the head. In a statement to NPR, a DHS spokesperson said that \"agents observed they were being aggressively tailgated by a red vehicle. As agents tried to make a U-turn, the red car crashed into Border Patrol. A hostile crowd surrounded agents and their vehicle, and began verbally abusing them and spitting on them. As Border patrol arrested one individual, who actively resisted arrest, pepper spray was deployed spray to deter the agitator and disperse the crowd.

        By The Associated Press \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 10:57 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         LONDON — British police dismissed speculation on Sunday that a mass stabbing attack on a London-bound train the previous evening was terrorism-related and said two people who were wounded remain in a life-threatening condition. Police also said that two men, born in the United Kingdom, remain in custody at separate police stations. They were arrested eight minutes after the first emergency calls were made at 7:42 p.m. from aboard the train, where passengers had reported scenes of panic and chaos with many running through the carriages and some seeking safety in the toilets. \"This is a shocking incident and my thoughts are with those who have been injured and their families,\" British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless said outside the station in Huntingdon in eastern England where the train halted soon after the attack. \"There is nothing to suggest this is a terrorist incident,\" he added. The two arrested remain in custody, he said, adding that one is a 32-year-old Black British man, the other is a 35-year-old man of Caribbean descent. The relationship of the two suspects was not revealed, nor was the type of knife, or knives, used. Loveless also gave an update on the wounded, reducing the number in life-threatening condition from nine to two. He said four of them were discharged and that one other person arrived at the hospital, taking the overall number treated to 11. After its emergency stop in Huntingdon, a market town around 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of London, bloodied and confused passengers spilled out of the train. Dozens of police waited, some of them armed, and the two suspects were quickly arrested, Loveless said. During the immediate response to the attack, police said that \"Plato,\" the national code word used by police and emergency services when responding to what could be a \"marauding terror attack,\" was initiated. That declaration was later rescinded but no motive for the attack has been disclosed. \"At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident,\" Loveless said. The attack took place as the 6:25 p.m. train from Doncaster in northern England to London's King's Cross station was about halfway through its two-hour journey, having just departed from a stop at Peterborough. Passenger Olly Foster told the BBC he heard people shouting \"run, run, there's a guy literally stabbing everyone,\" and initially thought it might have been a Halloween prank — Saturday was the day after Halloween. But as passengers pushed past him to get away, he noticed his hand was covered in blood from a chair he had leaned on. Following reports that some of those on board the train put themselves in harm's way to protect others, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood praised the \"exceptional bravery of staff and passengers on the train.\" King Charles III said he and his wife, Queen Camilla, sent their sympathies and thoughts to those affected and that they were \"truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack.\" London North Eastern Railway, or LNER, which operates the East Coast Mainline services in the U.K., confirmed the incident had happened on one of its trains and said there would be major disruption on the route until Monday. British Transport Police's Loveless said passengers will see a \"high visibility presence of police officers at stations and on trains\" on Sunday. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5594753","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"01:45:00-05:00","title":"US carries out new strike in Caribbean, killing 3 alleged drug smugglers","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military conducted another strike in the Caribbean Sea, killing three alleged drug smugglers, marking at least the 15th such operation since early September 2025.

The U.S. military has now killed at least 64 people in the strikes. Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.

Clocks fell back an hour on Sunday morning and many people may have enjoyed an extra hour of slumber. Going forward, this change means darker evenings and brighter mornings — and you can take advantage of that morning light to reset your sleep schedule. This can be especially helpful for teenagers who get chronically little sleep. Three out of four high school students don't get enough shut-eye,  according  to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dragging groggy teens out of bed in the morning, or forcing them off their screens and into bed at night can be frustrating for parents. Sleep doctors say a little better understanding of the adolescent biology of bedtime can help your teen sleep more. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sleep drive and circadian clocks More than other age groups, teens have to fight to stay on a schedule that doesn't match their biology. One reason is our internal 24-hour clock, the circadian clock, which you can think of \"as the conductor of an orchestra of many clocks throughout the body,\" says  Stephanie Crowley , a chronobiologist at Rush University in Chicago.. At the start of puberty, this orchestra of clocks decides — hey, I want to stay up reeeeally late. This changes again around our late 20s but for teens it means they often just don't feel sleepy as early. Then there's the homeostatic sleep drive, which is the other major biological mechanism that regulates sleep. It doesn't do teens any favors either. The sleep drive tracks how long you've been awake and tells your body when to shut down. But this physiological process slows down in teens, so they get tired more slowly, explains Crowley. \"You can think about it as a pressure cooker,\" she says. \"So that pressure for sleep to begin just kind of grows much more slowly in the more mature adolescent.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       School schedules and pressures Even experts in sleep medicine struggle with this aspect of parenting, says  Dr. Sanjay Patel , a sleep medicine physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and father to 15-year-old twins. Patel says he and his wife do the best they can to help their daughters get quality rest. For example, the high school sophomores don't have their phones in their bedrooms at night, nor are they allowed to sleep past 8:00 am on weekends since this can throw off their weekday schedule. \"I think that parents and teens need to just be involved in trying to point out how this is affecting them day to day, because otherwise it's just nothing changes,\" he says. But there's nothing Patel can do about his daughters' school day starting at 7:28 am, a time that doesn't align with their biology. School start times are a big problem, but after school demands on teens also steal their sleep, says  Mary Carskadon , a sleep researcher at Brown University. Teens' schedules are packed with extracurriculars, parttime jobs, and homework. Carskadon says all of this contributes to pervasive sleep deprivation. It's why she gets annoyed when people disparage teens for moodiness or poor impulse control since these behaviors are hallmarks of poor sleep. \"I mean, they're really blaming the victim,\" she says. For teens to get better rest, Carskadon advocates for the schools to start later and give less homework. And she says extracuriculars shouldn't be allowed to drag far into the evening. \"We have to think full circle,\" says Carskadon, noting that public health issues like the teen  suicide rate  and  car accidents  might be mitigated if adolescents had better rest. Another systemic change Carskadon, Crowley, and Patel want is an end to daylight saving time and to remain on standard time throughout the year. This would increase exposure to morning light, which is a critical environmental cue that it's time to wake up, and could help teens adapt their circadian clocks to an earlier schedule. Sleep strategies to try at home Sleep doctors recommend several strategies parents can use to help teens. For one, remind teens that quality rest allows them to excel in athletics or academics, says  Dr. Rafael Pelayo , who works with adolescents at Stanford Medicine's Sleep Medicine Center. He also recommends letting them do something they enjoy when they first wake up. For example, if a kid's a gamer, then power up the Xbox at 7:00 am, and, he says, tell them: \"The earlier you wake up, the more time you can play the video game. And then you get light into your eyes.\" Don't send kids to their bedrooms as a punishment, Pelayo says, because that creates a negative association with the area where they sleep. And parents should model healthy sleep behaviors for their teens, which includes no late-night snacking or doom scrolling. On the weekends, many teens catch up on missed rest by sleeping in hours past their weekday alarm. Crowley says that this causes a sort of jet lag as it shifts a teen's internal clock by 45 or 50 minutes in just two days. An hour or so of extra rest is fine, but Crowley agrees with Patel that it's best to get up at about the same time every day — even Saturdays. And Crowley's research has found that, unfortunately, long naps can exacerbate the problem because it weakens the homeostatic sleep drive by causing teens to feel tired even later. Crowley recommends capping naps at 30 minutes. A big challenge a lot of teens face is they just don't feel tired at night, though Crowley says the recent change to standard time is a chance to transition into a better schedule. Say you usually go to bed at midnight. Maybe tonight, turn off the lights at 11 p.m. It will probably still feel like midnight to your body, but you'll wake up with an extra hour of rest. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5594838","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"10:39:00-05:00","title":"Five German mountaineers die in northern Italy after being hit by avalanche","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five German mountaineers died in an avalanche near the Cima Vertana in the Ortles mountains of South Tyrol, Italy, on Saturday, November 1, 2025.

Three victims — two men and a woman — had already been recovered dead on Saturday, while the bodies of two other missing people, a man and his 17-year-old daughter, were found on Sunday morning. \"They had been dragged to the lower part of the gully where the avalanche occurred,\" said Alpine rescue spokesman Federico Catania. \"Rescue teams are now returning to the valley, also considering the worsening weather conditions at high altitude.\" The mountaineers, all Germans, were hit by the avalanche at about 4 p.m. on Saturday while climbing near the Cima Vertana, in the Ortles mountains, at an altitude of more than 3,500 meters (11,500 feet). It is unknown why the climbers were still on their way up at this relatively late hour, rescuers said. According to initial information, the climbers were in three groups and were traveling independently of each other. Two men survived the accident and were taken by helicopter to a hospital in the near city of Bolzano. South Tyrol is a popular region for mountaineering among tourists from Germany. The region's highest peak is Ortles, which rises to 3,905 meters. Avalanche accidents are a persistent issue in the Italian Alps, with the country registering one of the higher 10-year average annual death tolls among major ski nations. Victims are frequently ski mountaineers or freeriders. Some analysis suggests that the number of accidents has increased in recent years possibly due to more people heading to backcountry areas immediately after fresh snowfall. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96215","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"20:39:00-04:00","title":"Trump threatens military action in Nigeria over Christian persecution claims","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump threatened military action and suspended all aid to Nigeria, claiming the government is failing to protect Christians from persecution.

The president also warned that he \"will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria.\" \"If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing,' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,\" Trump posted on social media. \"I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!\" The warning came after Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu earlier on Saturday pushed back on Trump announcing a day earlier that he was designating the West African country \"a country of particular concern\" for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians. In a social media statement on Saturday, Tinubu said that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality. \"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\" Trump on Friday said \"Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria\" and \"radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter.\" Trump's comment came weeks after U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz urged Congress to designate Africa's most populous country as a violator of religious freedom with claims of \"Christian mass murder.\" Nigeria's population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough. Attacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes. While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur. Kimiebi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated the commitment of Nigeria to protect citizens of all religions. \"The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion,\" Ebienfa said in a statement on Saturday. \"Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.\" Nigeria was placed on the country of particular concern list by the U.S. for the first time in 2020 over what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" The designation, which did not single out attacks on Christians, was lifted in 2023 in what observers saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95400","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"07:04:00-05:00","title":"They Were Promised a Lifeline to 'Graduate' from Poverty.

Then it was taken away \n         By Fatma Tanis \n        \n           Sunday, November 2, 2025 • 7:04 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         PALABEK, Northern Uganda — Imagine if you were a refugee living at a makeshift settlement in a foreign country with no way to earn a steady income. Then someone promised you a life-changing opportunity: They'd give you a sum of money and a coach to help you turn it into a source of income. But just as you are about to receive that support, it gets canceled. That's what happened to some 8,100 South Sudanese refugees in Uganda this year. They were enrolled in a program with a bureaucratic name — Graduating to Resilience Scale Activity — and a simple strategy: a $205 sum for each participant along with coaching to start a small business. That may not seem like a lot of money, but in Uganda, the average annual income is $753. And in the Palabek camp, home to about 100,000 refugees, most people have no way to earn a living other than occasional farming work, at best making $2 a week. The camp is just around 30 miles away from the border with South Sudan, were a civil war and ethnic violence that began in 2013 led tens of thousands of people — many on foot — to flee to Uganda. New refugees continue to arrive every day as conditions in South Sudan remain unstable.  Before the Trump administration's aid cuts, the residents of the camp relied mainly on food or cash from aid groups to survive.   Last year the U.S. government awarded a $15 million grant to the nonprofit group  AVSI Foundation  to set up what's known as a \"Graduation Approach\" program serving the refugee and host communities. The goal was that in three years, the participants would ... graduate ... from extreme poverty and become self-supporting. In  past studies , similar programs with a onetime cash award plus coaching have produced a \"significant\" increase in the income of participants after 24 months.   In addition to the refugee households, some 3,500 Ugandans living in extreme poverty near the settlement were to participate. The arrival of tens of thousands of refugees in the area has been a strain for locals as they have had to share limited land, water, and firewood resources with refugees. While the refugees can get some help from aid groups, locals often are overlooked, and AVSI's program aimed to bridge some of that gap.  In February 2025   the grant to AVSI was abruptly nullified —  along with thousands of other programs  around the world — as part of the overhaul of foreign aid set in motion by the Trump administration. In the letters the administration sent out to non-profit groups like AVSI, it said the terminated programs were not aligned with U.S. national interests.  AVSI — founded in Italy in 1972 as the Association of Volunteers in International Service — had to lay off 140 local staff recently hired for the Palabek project, according to Rita Larok, the director of programs. As difficult as it was to let staff go, Larok says it was even harder to break the news to the participants, who saw the project as their only way to becoming self-sufficient. Their \"hopes and dreams [were] shattered,\" she says. The disappointment of the lost opportunity has reverberated through the settlement and local towns, says Ugandan official Fivi Akullu, the Refugee Desk Officer for the settlement.  \"If the U.S. government had a heart, actually, this [funding cut] should have been done phase by phase,\" she says. \"It was a very drastic decision to say this is it. No funding, no nothing.\" NPR reached out to the State Department for comment but did not receive a response. On a trip to Uganda, NPR interviewed some of the individuals affected by the cancellation. Akim Joseph Yanga: \"Let us be resilient\" Akim Joseph Yanga was excited about the cash and the coaching. The 63-year-old planned to buy as many as 5 goats — that's what $205 would cover — and start a small livestock business. He was counting on the program coach to help him figure out the logistics of the business and how to best use his skills to build it. The AVSI project gave people hope, says Yanga, who'd fled South Sudan in 2019 because of conflict.   And in the wake of the program's dissolution, he and other camp officials have seen signs of despair:   an increase in cases of violence that have required his mediation, including domestic violence and thefts of neighbors' chickens or goats. There have even been several suicide attempts, he says.  \"It is true that when our father, Donald Trump, started reducing the [foreign aid] budget globally. It affected us very seriously,\" Yanga says, adding that he calls the U.S. president \"father\" because he sees him as a provider to vulnerable people around the world. Yanga has been telling disappointed families in the camp not to lose hope.  \"My message to them is let us be resilient. God will not forget us. The Samaritans will come and help us.\" Santa Angwech: \"I was completely hopeless\" Santa Angwech, a 26-year-old single mom with three children, saw the AVSI program as a lifeline. In anticipation of growing a business with the program, she started making cassava chips to sell in the market from cassava she'd planted in front of her hut, with seeds she had received from aid groups.  More so than the money, she was looking forward to what the coaches would teach her: how to build the business, save money, grow additional crops and even how to deal with the gender-based violence that is part of camp life. In February, she received a text message from AVSI that the program had shut down. \"I was completely hopeless when I saw the message. \"The big question that I have is how you can solve my problems. That is the only thing I need, because if I know how to solve the problem, nothing will defeat me,\" Angwech says. She's not angry at the U.S. for its decision to cut aid.    \"You cannot be angry [at] somebody who refused to give you something because you are just a beggar,\" she says.  Instead, she prays that funding will flow again soon: \"If they do not help us? Where should we start from? What should we do? There is nothing.\" Okot Bosco: \"America benefits, but they don't know\" For Okot Bosco, 36, the new AVSI program was an opportunity he could only have dreamed of as a refugee at the camp — the former teacher had been hired as a coach to guide participants for the 3-year duration of the project. Now he's lost this job — and his hope of using his salary from AVSI to pay back a loan he'd taken from a local bank to build up a small shop selling basic household items.  He's now struggling with supporting his children and wife and has taken up farming work. Bosco believes that President Trump, in making these cuts, doesn't understand that not only do recipients of aid benefit — America, as the giver, does too. \"When you're in a problem and someone helps you, you will never forget that person.\" That philosophy is reflected in his own life. He was born in a displaced persons camp during the Sudanese civil war of the 1980s.  \"I grew up seeing this logo of USAID on the cooking oil can and food boxes — knowing that Americans are the people who can support us in food, education, in medicine, in everything,\" Bosco says. \"America benefits, but they don't know that they are benefiting. They benefit because the people trust them so much.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591404","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Shopping for ACA health plans this open enrollment?

Here's what to know \n         By Michelle Andrews \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This year's Obamacare open enrollment period, which starts Saturday in most states, is full of uncertainty and confusion for the more than  24 million people  who buy health insurance through the federal and state Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The fate of the enhanced premium tax credits that make coverage more affordable for  92% of enrollees  remains up in the air, with the prospect of significantly  higher premiums looming . But there are steps marketplace shoppers can take to ensure they make the right choices for the upcoming plan year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. Understand how we got here In 2021, as part of a COVID-era relief package, the ACA premium tax credits were enhanced to lower costs for previously eligible people and expand eligibility to people with incomes over 400% of the federal poverty level (which amounts to  about $63,000  for one person in 2025). But those enhancements, which were extended in 2022,  will expire  at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts. The debate over whether to extend them again has been at the center of a political battle of wills between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, a fight at the heart of the now month-old  government shutdown. The financial implications for many marketplace enrollees are huge. Average out-of-pocket premium payments for subsidized enrollees are projected to more than double if the enhanced tax credits expire, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. \"The longer this goes on, the more damage is done,\" said  Cynthia Cox , a vice president and the director of the Program on the ACA at KFF. \"If someone logs on Nov. 1 and sees their premium doubling, they might just walk away.\" That would be a mistake, marketplace experts agree. What is clear, though, is that buyers need to beware and be informed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Follow the news It can be frustrating to track day-to-day Capitol Hill machinations. But that may be your best source for up-to-date information. Congress could make a deal to extend the enhanced subsidies anytime during the next few days, weeks or months -- or not. Either way, it could affect your enrollment decision. So, pay attention. Don't count on the marketplace or your insurer to notify you about what you should expect to pay. \"Many state marketplaces have hit delay\" on sending consumers notices of net premiums, which take premium tax credits into account, said  Sabrina Corlette , a co-director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. The federal government doesn't send enrollees notices about plan premiums for the coming year for the  28 federally facilitated  marketplaces. For 2026, it has said that health plans can also  opt not  to. 3. Update your account information and don't auto-enroll Log in to your marketplace account and update your income, household size, and any other details that have changed. This year, it's particularly important to provide an accurate estimate of your anticipated income for 2026. A provision in HR 1, sometimes called the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act ,  eliminated the caps  on what many people were required to repay if they underestimated their projected income and received more premium assistance than they should have. Next year, people will have to repay the entire excess amount. In the past few years, it's been possible to put your ACA insurance on auto-pilot with  automatic reenrollment  in your current or a similar plan. Given the uncertainty around premiums, this is not a good year to do that, enrollment specialists say. This is especially true for people who, without a deal in Congress, will no longer qualify for subsidies next year, specifically those whose incomes are over 400% of the federal poverty level. 4. Shop based on sticker prices When people see their projected premiums, assuming Congress hasn't reached a deal to extend the enhanced credits, many will be shocked. Health insurance premiums on the marketplaces are expected to increase, on average, 26% next year,  according to KFF . That's the largest rate increase since 2018. Until now, people have largely been shielded from those increases by the enhanced premium tax subsidies that nearly all enrollees receive. Here's how it works: Most people with ACA marketplace plans are responsible for paying a portion of their premium based on a sliding income scale, and the government pays the rest. According to an analysis by KFF, if the enhanced credits are not renewed, a family of four with $75,000 in income, for example,  will be responsible  for paying $5,865 in annual premiums for a benchmark silver plan in 2026 — more than double the $2,498 it'll pay if they are renewed. When evaluating a plan, focus on the listed price. If it's not affordable without the enhanced tax credits, it's not a good buy. \"People need to make a decision based on what is in front of them,\" Cox said. If you can't afford the sticker price without the enhanced credits, consider enrolling in a less generous plan with a lower premium but a higher deductible, Cox said. Bronze plans must provide comprehensive coverage, including covering preventive care at no cost, and may cover some doctor visits before the deductible. \"In most cases, it makes more sense to have a bronze plan than to be uninsured,\" she said. The Trump administration has been promoting  catastrophic plans  as a more affordable option for people who face financial hardship, including those who don't qualify for subsidies because their incomes are either less than 100% or more than 400% of the federal poverty level. Similar to bronze plans, catastrophic plans cover a set of essential health benefits, provide free preventive care, and must cover at least three doctor visits before people reach their deductible. But catastrophic plan deductibles are the highest of any type of marketplace plan: $10,600 for individuals and $21,200 for families in 2026. \"They are expensive relative to what they cover,\" said  Jennifer Sullivan , director of health coverage access at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noting premiums can cost several hundred dollars. 5. Come back, check, and recheck If you're dismayed at premium prices on your first pass, \"don't slam the computer shut and decide that there are no options for you,\" Sullivan said. \"Congress might still act and things might change radically.\" Lawmakers could restore the enhanced premium tax credits right up to the end of the year, or later. In a majority of states, including the 28 that use the federal government's centralized marketplace, open enrollment lasts until Jan. 15. There are also other key dates to remember. In most states, people  must enroll  by Dec. 15 for coverage starting Jan. 1, and by Jan. 15 for coverage starting Feb. 1, though some states have later deadlines. 6. Wait to pay your premium Premium payments are generally due before the plan takes effect, although marketplaces and insurers have flexibility to extend deadlines, Corlette said. They might allow people extra time to make a first payment, for example. \"We've seen that in the past. State officials and insurance companies have gotten creative to try and keep people in coverage,\" she said. But if there is a last-minute deal and someone has already paid their premium for January coverage and received a lower tax credit than the deal provides, they should still be able to receive the higher credit. \"There are ways to make people whole,\" Corlette said, although how that might happen this enrollment period is unclear.

(AP) — Kyle Busch bought what he thought was a safe life insurance plan that would provide self-funding income for his retirement. When Pacific Life Insurance Company sent a sixth premium notice on what was supposed to be a five-year payment plan — and most of the money he invested was gone — the two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion knew something was wrong. “I was like, wait a second, what am I getting a sixth-year premium payment for?” Busch said from Phoenix Raceway on Saturday. “We got on a call with the guy who sold me the premium policies and he ran me around in all these circles, couldn’t answer the questions, so I was like, this is fishy.” Once Busch and his wife Samantha realized something was wrong, they turned to an independent firm that found their policy would expire in 16 months and all of the $10.4 million they invested gone. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Now the Buschs are suing Pacific Life for $8.5 million, alleging the insurance company failed to reveal the true risks of the policies, along with providing false and negligent representations of what was supposed to be tax-free income for retirement.

He was instead told his money was going to the insurance company’s account instead of being invested into a market, so his investment never went up as the market rose. “That was a lie,” Busch said on the eve of NASCAR’s season finale. “I looked at it was like, this sounds too good to be true, but you’ve got to believe in those that are looking at it for you and trusting in the people with Pacific Life email addresses that are sending you the documents.” Pacific Life issued a statement saying it does not comment on specifics of individual matters to maintain the privacy and trust of its clients. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “For nearly 160 years, we have committed ourselves to fairness, integrity, and acting in the best interests of our clients — and we continue to take this responsibility very seriously,” the statement said. “Pacific Life offers several different life insurance products, each with unique characteristics that are important to understand before making a decision.” At issue is an Indexed Universal Life insurance policy, a combination of life insurance that provides a death benefit with a cash value component. The cash value growth is tied to a stock market index, supposedly with built-in protections against market downturns. Once Busch realized what had happened to him, his attorney found other people who had invested in IULs and lost all of their money. “These insurance companies are too big to be (messing) with the little people, so we’re going to go at them,” he said. “It’s not just race car drivers or athletes or rich people of the world and this is why we’re going public with it.” The lawsuit also names Pacific Life agent Rodney A. Smith for steering the Buschs into an unsustainable, high-risk product, along with charging an up-front 35% commission they were unaware of. “I was like wow, before my money even went into Pac Life, the guy got 35% commission,” Busch said. “That was after the fact.” ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5594836","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"11:12:00-05:00","title":"How U.S.-China tensions leave countries like South Korea stuck in the middle","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korea finds itself caught between the competing economic and strategic interests of the United States and China, as demonstrated by the recent APEC summit where President Lee Jae-myung met with President Xi Jinping.

November 2, 2025 • 11:12 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         GYEONGJU, South Korea — President Trump sat down with President Xi Jinping of China on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation convention (APEC) in South Korea last week. The leaders of the world's biggest economies met at the airport in Busan, an hour's drive away from the APEC host city of Gyeongju, for just an hour and 40 minutes. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Despite the brevity of the much-anticipated rendezvous — and Trump's absence in the main APEC Economic Leaders' Summit — the countries' trade dispute loomed large over the event. On Saturday, representatives from APEC's 21 member countries acknowledged challenges facing the global trade system and supply chains in a joint declaration. They called for \"a trade and investment environment that promotes resilience and benefits for all.\" Tensions on show at APEC As the chair of this year's APEC, President Lee Jae Myung of South Korea advocated for the multilateral forum's role in spite of \"different values and objectives\" among its members. \"The goal is to identify common challenges that can be discussed together and to maximize cooperation within possible scope,\" Lee said. But some experts question how viable and concrete such cooperation can be when the U.S. is shifting from a supporter of trade liberalism to an increasingly protectionist and transactional position. It was \"because of benign U.S. leadership\" and \"a clear lack of security concerns\" in the post-Cold War era that APEC could set the agenda for the global trade regime, says Jeffrey Robertson, an associate professor of Diplomatic Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. Transforming the institution to reflect the new global order is difficult for comparatively small players in the region, he adds, \"because they're caught between the United States and China.\" Korea: between China and the U.S. Like many APEC members, South Korea's balancing act between the U.S. and China has been put to test. Its relationship with China suffered in 2016 when South Korea decided to host a U.S.  missile defense system  known as THAAD. China retaliated with measures aimed at the country's tourism, retail and entertainment industries — many of which are still in effect. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Though China remains the biggest importer of South Korean goods, it may soon be outpaced by the U.S. According to 2024  data  from the Korea International Trade Association, China's purchases were ahead of the U.S. by less than one percentage point, down from nearly 15 points a decade ago. South Koreans increasingly see the U.S. as the most important country for their country's economy, in addition to security,  surveys  show. During an August visit to Washington, President Lee  declared  that South Korea's \"U.S. for security, China for economy\" approach is over. The tariff deal finalized this week between Washington and Seoul is likely to further connect the allies' economies. In return for a lowered tariff on cars and auto parts, South Korea agreed to invest 350 billion dollars in the U.S. over a period of at least 10 years. China and Korea's growing rivalry In contrast, China and South Korea have grown increasingly at odds as China's technological advancement accelerated. Once a manufacturing subcontractor of South Korean companies, China has now become their global rival in key industries like EV and electronics. Against this backdrop, Koreans' sentiment toward China is souring, particularly among younger generations. There have been anti-China  rallies  in downtown Seoul in recent months, where protesters chanted racist slurs and made unsubstantiated claims of Chinese inference in South Korean politics. Some  marched  in Gyeongju this week, chanting \"CCP [Chinese Communist Party] out.\" Those tensions were on show at APEC, where South Korea's President Lee met with Chinese President Xi. Before that meeting, the Chinese ambassador to Korea, Dai Bing,  warned  of \"regression\" in the bilateral relations. Additionally, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun  called on  the U.S. and South Korea to \"earnestly fulfill their nuclear non-proliferation obligations, and do what is conducive to regional peace and stability.\" That statement came in response to President Trump's recent approval of Seoul's push for a nuclear-powered submarine. Separately, earlier in October, China imposed sanctions on five U.S. subsidiaries of Hanwha Ocean, a South Korean shipbuilder that owns the main shipyards in Philadelphia. At their bilateral summit, Lee and Xi were both positive about their countries' relations, reaffirming their commitment to continued, stable economic cooperation. Lee's national security advisor Wi Sung-lac called the meeting a \"comprehensive restoration\" of relations. However, there were tensions below the surface. Wi Sung-lac revealed no immediate progress on the lingering sanctions over THAAD, and sidestepped giving a direct answer on the submarine issue. When asked about the recent sanctions on Hanwha Ocean, he said he expected it to be resolved when the U.S.-China trade dispute is resolved. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-store-fire-explosion-hermosillo-9d4f7ead04fbfaa435ff77cb0c1e3768","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"05:12:55+00:00","title":"Fire and Explosion at Waldo’s Store in Hermosillo Kills at Least 23, Injures 12","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fire and explosion at a Waldo’s convenience store in Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora state in Mexico, killed at least 23 people, including children, and injured 12 others.

on Saturday said he’s ordered the Pentagon to begin planning for potential military action in Nigeria as he stepped up his allegations that the government is failing to rein in the persecution of Christians in the West African country. The president also warned that he “will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria.” “If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’ to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” Trump posted on social media. “I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action.

In a social media statement on Saturday, Tinubu said that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality. “Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,” Tinubu said. “Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it.

Ted Cruz urged Congress to designate Africa’s most populous country as a violator of religious freedom with claims of “Christian mass murder.” Nigeria’s population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough. Attacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes. While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.

\n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         More than 40 million Americans who rely on federal food assistance woke up to uncertainty on Saturday over whether their aid is secure or when it will resume in full. A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday ordered the White House to use contingency funds to pay for those benefits. But it was unclear how that decision would correspond with  a separate decision  by a judge in Massachusetts telling the administration it had until \"no later than Monday\" to come up with a way to use emergency funds to pay for aid. The impasse over funding the government means that the nearly 1 in 8 U.S. residents who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to buy groceries may be facing at least a temporary lapse in benefits. Following Friday's decisions, President Trump said he had directed government lawyers to find a way to pay for SNAP, and that he instructed them to seek further clarity on the rulings. He cautioned, however, that even with immediate guidance, benefits \"will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out.\"  SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is the  country's largest anti-hunger program . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A coalition of Democratic governors and attorneys general are suing the federal government to keep the payments flowing, arguing the benefits cannot legally be cut off. The Trump administration says it's not legal to extend the benefits using emergency funds — though the administration extended benefits during a shutdown in the first term. As congressional gridlock continues,  states are exploring what they can offer their residents  who've just lost their food aid. Eyes turning to food banks   Food bank administrators are warning that the loss of November SNAP benefits could lead to a public health crisis. Jason Riggs, the director of advocacy and public policy at Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico, likens it to the recession 17 years ago and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This is a huge increase in need, but that's where comparisons end,\" he said. \"When [those] happened, there was a robust SNAP program, with all its flaws, doing what it is designed to do. And that's the difference with what's happening right now — there will not be SNAP. There will just be the same kind of catastrophic need for food.\" More than 21% of New Mexico residents receive SNAP benefits, the highest rate in the nation. People are  turning to food banks to help fill in the assistance gap , but administrators caution they aren't designed to act as a safety net for a government program. \"It's very daunting,\" Riggs told NPR. \"SNAP can provide nine times the amount of meals as the entire nationwide food bank network.\" Central Texas Food Bank CEO Sari Vatske said shutdowns aren't like other food crises. \"In a situation during a natural disaster where we could rely on our sister food banks for support, with this government shutdown, we are all experiencing the same need,\" she said. Businesses that partner with grocery retailers and restaurants to take surplus or near-expired food and sell it at a heavy discount, like Too Good To Go and Flashfood, are trying to reach people affected. Flashfood CEO Jordan Schenck said the organization has seen a spike in downloads in the last few days. \"That started as [the SNAP cliff] really became more prevalent in the media. We've definitely seen more traffic,\" Schenck told NPR. The view from Capitol Hill   One month into the shutdown, there is no concrete off-ramp. The Senate left D.C. on Thursday for the weekend, ahead of two major pain points of the shutdown coming into sharper relief on Saturday: the SNAP cliff, and the start of open enrollment for health insurance plans sold on the exchanges as part of the Affordable Care Act. Health care has been at the center of Congressional Democrats' shutdown strategy. They have demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to  extend the enhanced subsidies , which were boosted during the pandemic. They are set to expire at the end of the year. If nothing changes, Americans who purchase healthcare via the exchange could see their  premiums skyrocket . At a Thursday town hall with Maryland Democrats, including Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, Democratic constituents urged the party to hold the line. \"I think they should hold out as long as possible,\" said Maryland voter Christina Thompson. \"It's clear whose shutdown this is. Republicans hold all the leverage and all the cards. And if we back out now, then we're just showing again the party has no backbone.\" Republicans have maintained throughout the month-long shutdown that Democrats must first vote alongside them to fund the government, before addressing the health care subsidies. The typically subdued Senate Majority Leader John Thune R-S.D.,  reproached Democrats  on the floor Wednesday after they tried to pass a measure that would fund SNAP and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). \"This isn't a political game,\" Thune said, raising his voice. \"These are real people's lives we're talking about and you all just figured out 29 days that, oh there might be some consequences?\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/harvard-medical-explosion-boston-a72804f99ba68661eb0460ad97fcbc21","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"21:22:19+00:00","title":"Explosion at Harvard Medical School Appears Intentional, No Injuries Reported","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An intentional explosion occurred at the Harvard Medical School’s Goldenson Building on early Saturday, with no injuries reported.

BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump says that Chinese President Xi Jinping has given him assurances that Beijing would take no action toward its long-stated goal of unifying Taiwan with mainland China while the Republican leader is in office. Trump said that the long-contentious issue of Taiwan did not come up in his talks with Xi on Thursday in South Korea that largely focused on U.S.-China trade tensions. But the U.S. leader expressed certainty that China would not take action on Taiwan, while he’s in office. “He has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, ‘We would never do anything while President Trump is president,’ because they know the consequences,” Trump said in an excerpt of an interview with the CBS’ program “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday. U.S. officials have long been concerned about the possibility of China using military force against Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy claimed by Beijing as part of its territory. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which has governed U.S. relations with the island, does not require the U.S. to step in militarily if China invades but makes it American policy to ensure Taiwan has the resources to defend itself and to prevent any unilateral change of status by Beijing.

(AP) — People across the country formed long lines for free meals and groceries at food pantries and drive-through giveaways Saturday, after monthly benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, were suddenly cut off because of the ongoing government shutdown . In the New York borough of the Bronx, about 200 more people than usual showed up at the World of Life Christian Fellowship International pantry, many bundled in winter hats and coats and pushing collapsible shopping carts as they waited in a line that spanned multiple city blocks. Some arrived as early as 4 a.m. to choose from pallets of fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, juice, dry goods and prepared sandwiches. Mary Martin, who volunteers at the pantry, also relies on it regularly for food to supplement her SNAP payments. She said she usually splits her roughly $200 a month in SNAP benefits between herself and her two adult sons, one of whom has six children and is especially dependent on the assistance. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “If I didn’t have the pantry to come to, I don’t know how we would make it,” Martin said.

McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the government to report back by Monday on how it would fund SNAP accounts. McConnell, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration must either make a full payment by that day or, if it decides to tap $3 billion in a contingency fund, figure out how to do that by Wednesday. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The delay in SNAP payments, a major piece of the nation’s social safety net that serves about 42 million people, has highlighted the financial vulnerabilities that many face. At the Bronx food pantry, the Rev. John Udo-Okon said “people from all walks of life” are seeking help now. “The pantry is no longer for the poor, for the elderly, for the needy. The pantry now is for the whole community, everybody,” Udo-Okon said. “You see people will drive in their car and come and park and wait to see if they can get food.” In Austell, Georgia, people in hundreds of cars in drive-through lanes picked up nonperishable and perishable bags of food. Must Ministries said it handed out food to about 1,000 people, more than a typical bimonthly food delivery. Families in line said they worried about not getting SNAP benefits in time for Thanksgiving. At a drive-through food giveaway at the Calvary Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, SNAP recipient James Jackson, 74, said he is frustrated that people are being hurt by decisions made in Washington and lawmakers should try harder to understand challenges brought by poverty and food insecurity. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “If you’ve never been poor, you don’t know what it is to be poor,” Jackson said. “I hope that it turns around. I hope that people get their SNAP benefits, and I hope we just come together where we can love each other and feed each other and help each other.” While there is typically a long line for Calvary Baptist Church’s drive-through events, the Rev. Samuel L. Whitlow said, the walk-in food pantry has seen increased demand recently with roughly 60 additional people showing up this week. And in Norwich, Connecticut, the St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen and food pantry had 10 extra volunteers working Saturday to help a wave of expected newcomers, making sure they felt comfortable and understood the services available. Besides groceries and hot meals, the site was providing pet food, toiletries and blood pressure checks. “They’re embarrassed. They have shame. So you have to deal with that as well,” director Jill Corbin said. “But we do our best to just try to welcome people.” ___ Haigh reported from Norwich, Connecticut.

Donald Trump sees tariffs — or the threat of them — as a powerful tool to bend nations to his will. He has used them in an unprecedented way, not only as the underpinning of his economic agenda , but also as the cornerstone of his foreign policy in his second term. He has wielded the import taxes as a threat to secure ceasefires from countries at war . He has used them to browbeat nations into promising to do more to stop people and drugs from flowing across their borders. He has used them, in Brazil’s case, as political pressure because its judicial system prosecuted a former leader who was a Trump ally, and in a recent blowup with Canada, as punishment for a television ad . This week, the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the Republican president has overstepped federal law with many of his tariffs. A ruling against him could limit or even take away that swift and blunt leverage that much of his foreign policy has relied on. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Trump increasingly has expressed agitation and anxiety about the looming decision in a case he says is one of the most important in U.S. history.

Trump had said he wanted to take the highly unusual step of attending the arguments in person, but on Sunday said he had ruled it out, saying he didn’t want to be a distraction. “I wanted to go so badly — I just don’t want to do anything to deflect the importance of that decision,” he told reporters on Air Force One. The Justice Department, in its defense of the tariffs, has highlighted the expansive way Trump has used them, arguing that the trade penalties are part of his power over foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not second-guess the president. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Earlier this year, two lower courts and most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that Trump did not have power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to set tariffs — a power the Constitution grants to Congress. Some dissenting judges on the court, though, said the 1977 law allows the president to regulate imports during emergencies without specific limitations. The courts left the tariffs in place while the Supreme Court considers the issue. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to wield them as he has tried to pressure or punish other countries on matters related — and unrelated -- to trade. “The fact of the matter is that President Trump has acted lawfully by using the tariff powers granted to him by Congress in IEEPA to deal with national emergencies and to safeguard our national security and economy,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “We look forward to ultimate victory on this matter with the Supreme Court.” Still, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the Trump trade team is working on contingency plans should the high court rule against the Republican administration. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “We do have backup plans,” Leavitt said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “But ultimately…we are hopeful that the Supreme Court will rule on the right side of the law and do what’s right for our country. The importance of this case cannot be overstated. The president must have the emergency authority to utilize tariffs.” Most presidents haven’t used tariffs as a foreign policy tool Modern presidents have used financial sanctions such as freezing assets or blocking trade, not tariffs, for their foreign policy and national security aims, said Josh Lipsky, a former Obama White House and State Department staffer who is now the international economics chair at the Atlantic Council. There are other laws that presidents can use to impose tariffs. But they require a monthslong process to justify the rates. Trump, citing the IEEPA, moves faster and more dramatically. He signs executive orders imposing new rates and fires off social media posts threatening additional import taxes, as he did in late October when he was angered by an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “Presidents have typically treated tariffs as a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,” Lipsky said. In contrast, Trump has used tariffs as the backbone of his national security and foreign policy agenda, Lipsky said. “All of it is interconnected and tariffs are at the heart of it,” he said. For example, earlier this year Trump had threatened a 30% tariff on European imports, a major increase from 1.2% before he took office. Seeking to secure Trump’s support for the NATO military alliance and for security guarantees for Ukraine in its war with Russia, the European Union struck a deal to settle for 15% tariffs. The EU Commission faced criticism from businesses and member states for giving away too much. But Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič argued the settlement was “not only about the trade. It’s about security. It’s about Ukraine.” Trump has been able “to use it in specific circumstances to get better deals — not just trade deals — but better deals overall than he might otherwise,” Lipsky said. “On the other hand, you would say there’s probably some backlash.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Supreme Court decision could rattle geopolitics — and wallets Trump’s tariff strong-arming has rattled relationships with America’s friends and foes. Some have responded by becoming more protectionist or looking to foster relations with China, which has tried to be seen as a promoter of free trade. There also is the impact on pocketbook. Some businesses have passed on some of the costs to consumers by raising prices, while others have waited to see where tariff rates end up. Tariffs traditionally have been used just as a tool to address trade practices. “There’s literally no precedent for the manner that President Trump is using them,” said Emily Kilcrease, who was a deputy assistant U.S. trade representative and earlier worked on trade issues at the National Security Council as a career civil servant during the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations, “The use of tariffs the way that President Trump is using them is like — just broadscale attack on an economy as a way to incentivize a foreign government to change their posture,” said Kilcrease, now a director at the Center for a New American Security think tank. But she said the case is not clear-cut. Kilcrease said she thinks there is a “decent chance” the Supreme Court could side with Trump because IEEPA gives the president “broad, flexible emergency powers.” The case is also coming before a Supreme Court that has thus far been reluctant to check to Trump’s wide-ranging use of executive powers. If the court constrains Trump, it could leave foreign governments questioning whether to try to renegotiate trade agreements recently struck with the Trump administration, experts said. But there are political realities at play too, because reneging on deals could affect other foreign policy or economic priorities. The administration could pivot to try to use other laws to justify the tariffs, though that could mean a more complex and bureaucratic process, Kilcrease said. “It certainly doesn’t take tariffs off the table,” she said. “It just makes them a little bit slower.” ___ Associated Press writer Lindsay Whitehurst contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41Z","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials.

It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/world-series-game-7-top-moments-cc56abe9a3fd756c445e44ebd62c682d","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"06:13:57+00:00","title":"Los Angeles Dodgers Defeat Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 in Historic 11-Inning World Series Game 7","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a dramatic and historic Game 7 of the 2025 World Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 in 11 innings, becoming the first team since the 1998–2000 Yankees to win back-to-back championships.

Here are the top moments from the epic Game 7: Bo Bichette chases Shohei Ohtani off the mound The Blue Jays took an early 3-0 lead when Bichette connected against Ohtani for his first homer since Sept. 2 — a few days before sustaining a left knee injury that sidelined him until the World Series and still hampered him throughout. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Ohtani was pitching on three days of rest, and although he was up to 100.9 mph with his fastball, his command was shaky and he appeared to run out of steam in the third. After fielding Nathan Lukes’ sacrifice bunt, he threw a wild pitch to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and allowed Bichette’s homer on the next pitch, his 51st and last of the night.

Yamamoto hit Alejandro Kirk with a pitch, loading the bases, before the Dodgers escaped with two helter-skelter defensive plays. With the infield playing in to prevent the winning run, Rojas fielded Daulton Varsho’s grounder to second base and nearly fell over. He gathered himself and threw home, but the toss briefly pulled Smith off the plate. Smith’s toe barely reconnected with the plate in time to get the forceout, a call confirmed by video review. Then center fielder Andy Pages, who had just been inserted off the bench to provide better defense, collided with left fielder Kiké Hernández while catching Ernie Clement’s long fly on the left-center warning track. Pages held on for the final out of the inning despite knocking Hernández to the ground. The Blue Jays strand three runners in the 10th Los Angeles loaded the bases with one out in the 10th inning, but Seranthony Domínguez got two quick outs to escape. Giménez threw out Mookie Betts at home plate on Pages’ grounder to shortstop, then Guerrero fielded Hernández’s grounder to first and flipped to Domínguez covering the bag on a close play. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Will Smith enters World Series lore Smith set a record for most innings caught in a single World Series with 74, and he helped ensure he wouldn’t have to catch a 75th with his solo shot in the 11th. Smith hit a 2-0 slider from Shane Bieber into the Blue Jays’ bullpen in left field, giving the Dodgers their first lead of the night. It was the first extra-inning homer in a World Series Game 7. Yamamoto closes it out Guerrero doubled off Yamamoto leading off the bottom of the 11th and advanced to third on Isiah Kiner-Falefa’s sacrifice bunt, and Toronto got the potential winning run on base when Addison Barger walked. Yamamoto then induced a game-ending 6-6-3 double play from Kirk, cementing the Dodgers’ second consecutive title and his World Series MVP award.

She was navigating the loss of her federal food aid benefits when she learned the assistance she receives for heating her Philadelphia apartment may also be at risk. “I feel like I’m living in scary times. It’s not easy to rest when you know you have things to do with limited accounts, limited funds. There isn’t too much you can do,” said Chapman, 74. Chapman relies on the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes. With temperatures beginning to drop in areas across the United States, some states are warning that funding for the program is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown , now in its fifth week. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The anticipated delay comes as a majority of the 5.9 million households served by the federally funded heating and cooling assistance program are grappling with the sudden postponement of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.

It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades. States manage the program. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data. While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet. Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. It is predicting payments will not go out until at least December, instead of November, as is customary. Minnesota’s energy assistance program is processing applications but the state’s Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. The agency does not plan to pay recipients’ heating bills until the shutdown ends. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “As temperatures begin to drop, this delay could have serious impacts,” the agency said. The program services 120,000 households, both homeowners and renters, that include many older adults, young children and people with disabilities. Connecticut has enough money to set aside to pay heating bills through at least the end of November or December, according to the group that helps administer LIHEAP. But the program faces uncertainty if the shutdown persists. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves. “The situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,” said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. More than 100,000 households were served last year. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, blamed the federal shutdown and the delay in LIHEAP payments on congressional Democrats and said the Trump administration is committed to reopening the government. “Once the government reopens, ACF will work swiftly to administer annual awards,” the spokesperson said, referring to the Administration for Children and Families, an agency within HHS. The spokesperson did not directly answer whether the timing could be affected by the administration’s earlier decision to fire workers who run the LIHEAP program . Wolfe, from the group that represents state program directors, predicts there could be delays into January. He noted there are questions over who will approve states’ program plans and how the money will be released when it becomes available. “Once you’ve fired the staff, things just slow down,” he said. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Low-income families face mounting obstacles Chapman, the retired school aide, may be eligible for a program through her gas utility to prevent being shut off this winter. But the roughly 9% of LIHEAP recipients who rely on deliverable fuels such as heating oil, kerosene, propane and wood pellets, typically do not have such protections. Electric and natural gas companies are usually regulated by the state and can be told not to shut people off while the state waits to receive its share of the LIHEAP money, Wolfe said. But it is different when it involves a small oil or propane company, fuels more common in the Northeast. “If you’re a heating oil dealer, we can’t tell that dealer, ‘Look, continue to provide heating oil to your low-income customers on the possibility you’ll get your money back,’” Wolfe said. Mark Bain, 67, who lives in Bloomfield, Connecticut, with his son, a student at the University of Connecticut, started receiving financial assistance for his home heating oil needs three years ago. “I remember the first winter before I knew about this program. I was desperate. I was on fumes,” said Bains, who is retired and relies on income from Social Security and a small annuity. “I was calling around to my social services people to find out what I could do.” He has been approved this year for $500 in assistance but he has a half tank of oil left and cannot call for more until it is nearly empty. By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it. He typically needs three deliveries to get through a winter. Bains said he can “get by” if he does not receive the help this year. “I would turn the heat down to like 62 (degrees) and throw on another blanket, you know, just to get through,” he said. ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

2025-10-29T07:27:00+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica\n\nHurricane Melissa is pummeling the Caribbean island of Cuba after it first caused devastation in Haiti and Jamaica, leading to the deaths of at least 32 people.\n\nTwenty of the reported deaths on Wednesday came after a river burst its banks in the southern coastal Haitian town of Petit-Goave, flooding and collapsing dozens of homes.\n\nThe mayor of the town, Jean Bertrand Subreme, said that people were still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other deaths were reported from Melissa in Haiti. Eight people were killed in Jamaica, including a baby killed after a tree fell in the western side of the island, according to State Minister Abka Fitz-Henley. One person was also reported to have been killed in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs it crossed Cuba on Wednesday, it weakened to a Category 2 storm from its previous Category 5 classification. It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

So many homes, so many people have been displaced,” she said.\n\n“We did prepare, but there wasn’t much that we could have done.”\n\nTrout Hall Rd,  Clarendon #TrackingMelissa   #HurricaneMelissa   #Jamaica   @CVMTV   pic.twitter.com/bTop93pOvp\n\n— Giovanni R. Dennis (@GiovanniRDennis)  October 28, 2025\n\nIn Kingston, Lisa Sangster, a 30-year-old communications specialist, said her home was devastated by the storm.\n\n“My sister … explained that parts of our roof were blown off and other parts caved in and the entire house was flooded,” she told the AFP news agency. “Outside structures like our outdoor kitchen, dog kennel and farm animal pens were also gone, destroyed.”\n\nMathue Tapper, 31, told AFP that those in the capital were “lucky”, but he feared for people in Jamaica’s more rural areas.\n\n“My heart goes out to the folks living on the western end of the island,” he said.\n\nAlthough Jamaica and Cuba are used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making the storms more severe.\n\nBritish-Jamaican climate change activist and author Mikaela Loach said in a video shared on social media that Melissa “gained energy from the extremely and unnaturally  hot seas  in the Caribbean”.\n\n“These sea temperatures are not natural,” Loach said. “They’re extremely hot because of the gases that have resulted from burning fossil fuels.”\n\n“Countries like Jamaica, countries that are most vulnerable to climate disaster, are also countries that have had their wealth and resources stripped away from them through colonial bondage,” Loach added.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting to the effects of a warming world.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nJamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, according to data from the World Resources Institute.\n\nBut like other tropical islands, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center reveals that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may significantly improve survival in cancer patients by activating the immune system, especially in those with previously 'cold' tumors.

were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/jamaica-haiti-and-cuba-take-stock-after-hurricane-melissa-destruction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:33:17+00:00","title":"Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, devastated multiple Caribbean nations, including Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba, with at least 34 deaths reported.

Melissa destruction\n\nPeople across the northern Caribbean are reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Melissa as dozens of deaths are reported in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.\n\nThe hurricane – at Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/death-toll-from-hurricane-melissa-climbs-to-49-with-many-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:15:49+00:00","title":"Death toll from Hurricane Melissa climbs to 49, with many still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, made landfall in Jamaica as a Category 5 storm with destructive winds of up to 295 km/h, resulting in 49 confirmed deaths—30 in Haiti, 19 in Jamaica, and one in the Dominican Republic—despite no direct hits in Haiti or the Dominican Republic.

apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage.

2025-10-23T08:09:33+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/ngos-note-28-new-carbon-bomb-projects-since-2021","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"12:50:39Z","title":"NGOs note 28 new ‘carbon bomb’ projects since 2021","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A report by four environmental NGOs—Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies—reveals that 28 new 'carbon bomb' fossil fuel extraction projects have been launched globally between 2021 and 2024.

past five years, according to a report issued by NGOs.\n\nDespite global efforts to phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/drinking-water-in-tehran-could-run-dry-in-two-weeks-iranian-official-says","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"19:16:15+00:00","title":"Drinking water in Tehran could run dry in two weeks, Iranian official says","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran’s capital Tehran is facing a severe drinking water crisis, with its primary reservoir, the Amir Kabir Dam, holding only 8% of its capacity — just 14 million cubic metres — enough to supply the city for only two weeks.

Melissa leaves 50 dead, toll expected to rise in Jamaica, Haiti\n\nHurricane Melissa is finally leaving the Caribbean after battering communities in Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba for days, leaving a trail of devastation that killed about 50 people.\n\nThe hurricane smashed into Jamaica with enormous force on Tuesday as a Category 5 storm, and residents were assessing their losses and the long road to recovery on Friday.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Jamaica remains without power, and nearly half of its water systems are offline.\n\nIn the historic seaside town of Black River, in southwest Jamaica, up to 90 percent of all structures were left without roofs, while the storm also snapped power lines and toppled concrete structures.\n\n“People are hungry,” said Monique Powell as she stood watch over a stash of groceries and household items for herself and a group of residents from Greenfield, one of many hurricane-torn communities on the outskirts of Black River.\n\n“Everything is gone,” said Michelle Barnes as she and her 13-year-old daughter secured their portion of handouts from local food establishments that were giving away their goods, many of which had become water-soaked and damaged.\n\nThe storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded, was made four times more likely because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by Imperial College London.\n\nJamaica’s Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon told a briefing that authorities had “quite credible” reports of a potential five additional deaths, but had not yet been able to confirm.\n\n“We’re still at 19 confirmed, but we do expect that will change today,” she said.\n\nIn nearby Haiti, authorities reported at least 31 people killed and 21 others missing, mostly in the country’s southern region. More than 15,800 people also remained in shelters.\n\nNo deaths were reported in Cuba as of Friday, where the civil defence evacuated more than 735,000 people across the eastern part of the island and where dangerous flooding continued in some areas on Friday.\n\nAlthough the full cost of Jamaica’s recovery is not yet known, the Caribbean country has allocated money for disaster response, including through a unique catastrophe bond arrangement with the World Bank.\n\nDixon said the bond, issued in 2024, provides Jamaica with $150m in financial protection for four hurricane seasons.\n\n“This bond, which provides payouts in the event of natural disasters until 2027, has been triggered by Hurricane Melissa,” she said on Friday.\n\nJamaica is  among many countries calling on wealthy nations to  increase climate financing  to help cover  the costs of climate-induced disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamaica’s Minister of Science, Energy and Technology Andrew Wheatley said that the country “deeply appreciates the global outpouring of support” in the wake of Melissa, but urged potential donors to be wary of scams and use the official government portal for donations.\n\nCuba was working on Friday to rescue residents still stranded by unprecedented floodwaters in the wake of Melissa.\n\nThe Cauto River overflowed its banks shortly after the Hurricane slammed into Cuba as a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, bringing upwards of 380mm (15 inches) of rain to some areas of the eastern end of the island.\n\nEmergency workers on Friday waded waist-deep in wetsuits and used boats and military vehicles to rescue residents from the still-rising waters of the country’s longest river.\n\nRio Cauto resident Eduardo Verdecia, 83, said he and his family had expected the river to subside, but continuing rains, plus run-off from nearby mountains and a fast-rising reservoir, had surprised them.\n\n“When night fell, we thought it would go down.

disputed South China Sea.\n\nPhilippine Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr and Canadian Defence Minister David McGuinty inked the Status of Visiting Forces Agreement (SOVFA) on Sunday after a closed-door meeting in Manila.\n\nMcGuinty said the deal would strengthen joint training, information sharing, and coordination during humanitarian crises and natural disasters.\n\nTeodoro described the pact as vital for upholding what he called a rules-based international order in the Asia-Pacific, where he accused China of expansionism. “Who is hegemonic? Who wants to expand their territory in the world? China,” he told reporters.\n\nThe agreement provides the legal framework for Canadian troops to take part in military exercises in the Philippines and vice versa. It mirrors similar accords Manila has signed with the United States, Australia, Japan and New Zealand.\n\nChina has not yet commented on the deal, but it has frequently accused the Philippines of being a “ troublemaker ” and “saboteur of regional stability” after joint patrols and military exercises with its Western allies in the South China Sea.\n\nBeijing claims almost the entire waterway, a vital global shipping lane, thereby ignoring a 2016 international tribunal ruling that dismissed its territorial claims as unlawful. Chinese coastguard vessels have repeatedly used water cannon and blocking tactics against  Philippine ships , leading to collisions and injuries.\n\nTeodoro used a regional defence ministers meeting in Malaysia over the weekend to condemn China’s declaration of a “ nature reserve ” around the contested Scarborough Shoal, which Manila also claims.\n\n“This, to us, is a veiled attempt to wield military might and the threat of force, undermining the rights of smaller countries and their citizens who rely on the bounty of these waters,” he said.\n\nTalks are under way by the Philippines for similar defence agreements with France, Singapore, Britain, Germany and India as Manila continues to fortify its defence partnerships amid rising tensions with Beijing."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/landslides-in-kenyas-rift-valley-leave-21-dead-30-others-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"02:38:49+00:00","title":"Landslides in Kenya’s Rift Valley leave 21 dead, 30 others missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rains during Kenya’s short rainy season triggered a deadly landslide and flash floods in the hilly Chesongoch area of Elgeyo-Marakwet County in western Kenya on November 1, 2025.

particularly its western parts, remain in dire need of humanitarian aid as key generals show no intention of ending the civil war amid ongoing violence and killings in North Darfur’s el-Fasher.\n\nInternational aid agencies called on Sunday on the Sudanese armed forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to facilitate increased entry of aid while a  roadmap by mediators  has failed to produce a ceasefire so far.\n\nA week after the paramilitary force seized el-Fasher, the state capital of North Darfur, after an 18-month siege and starvation campaign, the situation remains catastrophic.\n\nTens of thousands of civilians are still believed to be trapped in the final major city in the western region of Darfur to fall to the RSF while  thousands more are unaccounted for  after fleeing el-Fasher.\n\nOnly a fraction of those who fled on foot from el-Fasher have made it to Tawila, a town roughly 50km (30 miles) away.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera from Tawila, an official with a France-based aid agency said only a few hundred more people have turned up in the town over the past few days.\n\n“Those are very small numbers considering the number of people who were stuck in el-Fasher. We keep hearing feedback that people are stuck on the roads and in different villages that are unfortunately still inaccessible due to security reasons,” said Caroline Bouvard, Sudan country director for Solidarites International.\n\nBouvard said there is a “complete blackout” in terms of information coming out of el-Fasher after the RSF takeover and aid agencies are getting their information from surrounding areas where up to 15,000 people are believed to be stuck.\n\n“There’s a strong request for advocacy with the different parties to ensure that humanitarian aid can reach these people or that at least we can send in trucks to bring them back to Tawila.”\n\nMany of the  people who have managed to survive  numerous RSF checkpoints and patrols to reach Tawila have reported seeing mass executions, torture, beatings and sexual violence. Some were abducted by armed men and forced to pay a ransom on pain of death.\n\nMany more have been forcibly displaced to the al-Dabbah refugee camp in Sudan’s Northern State. Some have been there for weeks.\n\nReporting from the camp, Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan said over the past few days, more displaced people have poured in from el-Fasher, exacerbating the humanitarian situation.\n\nPeople are in need of food, clean water, medication and shelter as many are sleeping out in the open. Thousands more could turn to the camp as well as other surrounding areas over the coming days as people flee the slaughter by RSF fighters.\n\nThe United States, Saudi Arabia,  United Arab Emirates  and Egypt, as mediators, have all condemned the mass killings and called for increased humanitarian assistance.\n\n“The RSF must stop engaging in retribution and ethnic violence; the tragedy in El Geneina must not be repeated,” the US Department of State said in a statement on Saturday in reference to the  massacre of Masalit people  in West Darfur’s capital.\n\n“There isn’t a viable military solution, and external military support only prolongs the conflict. The United States urges both parties to pursue a negotiated path to end the suffering of the Sudanese people,” it said in a post on X.\n\nUS lawmakers have also called for action from Washington in the aftermath of the el-Fasher takeover by the RSF.\n\nRepublican Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Friday called for the US to officially designate the RSF as a “foreign terrorist organisation”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24Z","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/powerful-magnitude-6-3-quake-hits-north-afghanistans-hindu-kush-region","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"22:09:41+00:00","title":"Earthquake kills at least 20 as it strikes northern Afghanistan","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck northern Afghanistan near Mazar-i-Sharif on November 2, 2025, killing at least 20 people and injuring 320.

action\n\nNigeria has said it would welcome assistance from the United States in fighting armed groups, as long as its territorial integrity is respected, as US President Donald Trump continued to  threaten military action  in the West African country over what he claimed was the persecution of Christians there.\n\nOfficials and experts in Nigeria on Sunday denied Trump’s claims of mass killings of Christians, noting that Boko Haram and al-Qaeda-linked groups target people of all faiths in Africa’s most populous country.\n\nBut Trump – who has directed his government to prepare for possible “fast” military action in Africa’s most populous country – doubled down on the threat on Sunday, saying he was he was considering a range of military options in Nigeria,\n\nWhen asked by a reporter if he was considering US troops on the ground in Nigeria or air strikes, Trump replied: “Could be, I mean, a lot of things – I envisage a lot of things.”\n\n“They’re killing the Christians and killing them in very large numbers. We’re not going to allow that to happen,” he added.\n\nNigeria, a country of more than 200 million people, is divided between the largely Muslim north and mostly Christian south. Armed groups have been engaged in a conflict that has been largely confined to the northeast of the country, which is majority Muslim, and has dragged on for more than 15 years.\n\nKimiebi Imomotimi Ebienfa, a spokesman for Nigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in an interview with Al Jazeera on Sunday, denied Trump’s claims of mass killings of Christians.\n\n“We are not proud of the security situation that we are passing through, but to go with the narrative” that only Christians are targeted, “no, it is not true. There is no Christian genocide in Nigeria”, he said.\n\n“We’ve continuously made our point clear that we acknowledge the fact that there are killings that have taken place in Nigeria, but those killings were not restricted to Christians alone. Muslims are being killed. Traditional worshippers are being killed… The majority is not the Christian population.”\n\nImomotimi Ebienfa said Nigeria was ready to work with its partners to “fight this scourge of terrorism, but not any passive action that will undermine the sovereignty of our country”.\n\nHe also vehemently denied that the Nigerian government has allowed the killings to take place.\n\n“The killings are not sanctioned by the Nigerian government,” he said. “The killing of any Nigerian in any part of the country is a loss to the country … The perpetrators of these killings are terrorist groups Boko Haram and other al-Qaeda and [ISIL] ISIS-affiliated groups that are perpetuating this crisis.”\n\nAn adviser to Nigerian President Bola Tinubu also echoed the sentiment.\n\nDaniel Bwala told the Reuters news agency on Sunday that the country would “welcome US assistance as long as it recognises our territorial integrity”.\n\nBwala sought to play down tensions between the two states, despite Trump calling Nigeria a “disgraced country”.\n\n“We don’t take it literally, because we know Donald Trump thinks well of Nigeria,” Bwala said.\n\n“I am sure by the time these two leaders meet and sit, there would be better outcomes in our joint resolve to fight terrorism,” he said.\n\nTrump’s threat of military action came a day after his administration added Nigeria back to a “Countries of Particular Concern” list of nations that Washington says have violated religious freedoms. Other nations on the list include China, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia and Pakistan.\n\nTinubu, a Muslim from southern Nigeria who is married to a Christian pastor, on Saturday pushed back against accusations of religious intolerance and defended his country’s efforts to protect religious freedom.\n\nWhen making key government and military appointments, Tinubu, like his predecessors, has sought to strike a balance to make sure that Muslims and Christians are represented equally. Last week, Tinubu changed the country’s military leadership and appointed a Christian as the new defence chief.\n\n“Since 2023, our administration has maintained an open and active engagement with Christian and Muslim leaders alike and continues to address security challenges which affect citizens across faiths and regions,” Tinubu said in a statement.\n\n“The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.”\n\nWhile human rights groups have urged the government to do more to address unrest in the country, which has experienced deadly attacks by Boko Haram and  other armed groups , experts say claims of a “Christian genocide” are false and simplistic.\n\n“All the data reveals is that there is no Christian genocide going on in Nigeria,” Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian humanitarian lawyer and analyst on conflict and development, told Al Jazeera. This is “a dangerous far-right narrative that has been simmering for a long time that President Trump is amplifying today”.\n\n“It is divisive, and it is only going to further increase instability in Nigeria,” Bukarti added, explaining that armed groups in Nigeria have been targeting both Muslims and Christians.\n\n“They bomb markets. They bomb churches. They bomb mosques, and they attack every civilian location they find. They do not discriminate between Muslims and Christians.”\n\nData by ACLED, a US crisis-monitoring group, backs Bugatti’s assertion.\n\nACLED research shows that out of 1,923 attacks on civilians in Nigeria so far this year, the number of those targeting Christians because of their religion stood at 50.\n\n“Insurgent groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa often present their campaigns as anti-Christian, but in practice, their violence is indiscriminate and devastates entire communities,” said Ladd Serwat, a senior Africa analyst at ACLED.\n\nThe violence in Nigeria, he told Reuters, “is part of the complex and often overlapping conflict dynamics in the country over political power, land disputes, ethnicity, cult affiliation, and banditry”.\n\nSerwat said the recent claims circulating among some US right-wing circles that as many as 100,000 Christians had been killed in Nigeria since 2009 are not supported by available data.\n\nEbenezer Obadare, a senior fellow of Africa studies at the Washington, DC-based Council on Foreign Relations, agreed and said the Trump administration should work with Nigerian authorities to address the “common enemy”.\n\n“This is precisely the moment when Nigeria needs assistance, especially military assistance,” Obadare told Al Jazeera. “The wrong thing to do is to invade Nigeria and override the authorities or the authority of the Nigerian government. Doing that will be counterproductive.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067291","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/colombias-eln-rebels-face-us-drug-threats-amid-push-for-peace-talks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"21:59:30+00:00","title":"Colombia’s ELN rebels face US drug threats amid push for peace talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the volatile Catatumbo region of Colombia, the National Liberation Army (ELN) maintains strong control over territory along the Venezuela border, where violent conflict with a FARC dissident faction has displaced thousands.

2025-11-02T21:59:30+00:00\n\nTitle: Colombia’s ELN rebels face US drug threats amid push for peace talks\n\nCatatumbo, Colombia –  The Catatumbo region, which stretches along the border with Venezuela in the department of Norte de Santander, is Colombia’s most volatile frontier.\n\nEndowed with oil reserves and coca crops but impoverished and neglected, this border area has historically been a site of violent competition between armed groups fighting for territorial control.\n\nThe  National Liberation Army (ELN) , Colombia’s largest remaining guerrilla force, maintains a strong and organised presence, operating across the porous border with Venezuela.\n\nIt is there that some of their fighters pick up an Al Jazeera reporting team and drive us to meet their commanders.\n\nTensions remain high in this region. In January, thousands of people were displaced because of the fighting between the ELN and a dissident faction from the  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  (FARC) that continues to operate in some parts of the country in spite of peace agreements brokered in 2016.\n\nThe fight is over control of the territory and access to the border with Venezuela, which is a crucial way to move drugs out of the country.\n\nEntering the area, it’s immediately apparent that the ELN is in total control here. There is no evidence of the country’s military. ELN flags decorate the sideroads, and the signs give a clear message of the way the group’s members see Colombia right now.\n\n“Total peace is a failure,” they say.\n\nThere is also no mobile phone signal. People tell the Al Jazeera team that telephone companies do not want to pay a tax to the armed groups controlling the territory.\n\nWhen President Gustavo Petro took office, he promised to implement a total peace plan with Colombia’s armed groups. But the  negotiations have not been easy,  especially with the ELN.\n\nGovernment offcials suspended the peace talks because of the fighting in Catatumbo, but now say they are ready to reinitiate talks.\n\nAl Jazeera meets with Commander Ricardo and Commander Silvana in a small house in the middle of the mountains. The interview has to be fast, they say, as they are concerned about a potential attack and reconnaissance drones that have been circulating in the area.\n\nThe commanders are accompanied by some of their fighters. Asked how many they have in the area, they respond, “We are thousands, and not everyone is wearing their uniforms. Some are urban guerrillas.”\n\nThe government estimates the ELN has around 3,000 fighters. But the figure could be much higher.\n\nCommander Ricardo, who is in charge of the region, says he believes there could be a chance for peace.\n\n“The ELN has been battling for a political solution for 30 years with various difficulties,” he says. “We believed that with Petro, we would advance in the process. But that did not happen. There’s never been peace in Colombia. What we have is the peace of the graves.”\n\nThe group and the government had been meeting in Mexico prior to the suspension of the talks. “If the accords we had in Mexico are still there, I believe our central command would agree [it] could open up the way for a political solution to this conflict”, Commander Ricardo tells Al Jazeera.\n\nBut it’s not just the fight with the Colombian state that has armed groups here on alert. The  United States military campaign against alleged drug vessels  in the Caribbean and Pacific – and the US’s aggressive posture towards the government of neighbouring Venezuela – have brought an international dimension to what was once an internal Colombian conflict.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump refers to these people not as guerrillas but “narco-terrorists”, and has not ruled out the possibility of attacking them on Colombian soil.\n\nThe US operation, which began in early September, has killed more than 62 people, including nationals from Venezuela and Colombia, and destroyed 14 boats and a semi-submersible.\n\nSome of the commanders have an extradition request from the US, and the government says they are wanted criminals.\n\nThe US strikes against boats allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean and the military build-up in the region to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro are seen by the ELN as another act of US imperialism.\n\nThe US government claims one of those boats belonged to the ELN. “Why don’t they capture them and show the world what they captured and what they are they trafficking?” Commander Ricardo asks. “But no, they erase them with a bomb.”\n\nHe also warns about the possibility of the ELN joining in the fight against the US. “In the hypothesis that Trump attacks Venezuela, we will have to see how we respond, but it’s not just us,” he says. “[It’s] all of Latin America because I am sure there are going to be many, many people who will grab a weapon and fight because it’s too much. The fact that the United States can step over people without respecting their self-determination has to end.”\n\nThe ELN was inspired by the Cuban revolution. But over the years, it has been involved in kidnappings, killings, extortion, and drug trafficking.\n\nCommander Silvana, who joined the group when she was a teen, says the ELN is not like other armed groups in the country.\n\n“Our principles indicate that we are not involved in drug trafficking,” she says. “We have told this to the international community. What we have is taxes in the territories we have been controlling for over 60 years. And if there is coca, of course, we tax it, too.”\n\nColombia has been a crucial US ally in the region over the decades in the fight against drug trafficking. But Petro has increasingly questioned the US policy in the Caribbean, arguing that Washington’s approach to security and migration reflects out-of-date Cold War logic rather than the region’s current realities.\n\nHe has criticised the US military presence and naval operations near Venezuela, warning that such tactics risk increasing tensions instead of promoting cooperation.\n\nTrump has accused Petro , who is a former guerrilla, of being a drug trafficker himself.\n\nPetro responded angrily, writing on X, “Colombia has never been rude to the United States. To the contrary, it has loved its culture very much. But you are rude and ignorant about Colombia.”\n\nColombia’s Foreign Ministry also condemned Trump’s remarks as offensive and a direct threat to the country’s sovereignty, and vowed to seek international support in defence of Petro and Colombian autonomy.\n\nThe belligerent US approach to Venezuela and Colombia, both led by leftist presidents – and the heightened possibility of a US military intervention – risk turning a local Colombia conflict into a broader regional one.\n\nEveryone on the ground is now assessing how they will respond if the US government gives its military the green light to attack Venezuela."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067270","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' discusses a major hurricane making landfall in Jamaica, referred to as the 'Storm of the century,' but no specific named entities are identified in the text.

He was rushed to a hospital, where he later died. He was 40 years old.\n\nA city council member and a bodyguard were also wounded in the attack.\n\nThe attacker was killed at the scene, Federal Security Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch told journalists on Sunday.\n\nThe attack was carried out by an unidentified man who shot the mayor seven times, Harfuch said. The weapon was linked to two armed clashes between rival criminal groups operating in the region, he added.\n\n“No line of investigation is being ruled out to clarify this cowardly act that took the life of the mayor,” Harfuch said.\n\nThe Mexican president promised there would be justice.\n\nSheinbaum called an emergency meeting of her security cabinet on Sunday morning, later condemning Manzo’s “vile” assassination in a statement on X.\n\n“We reaffirm our commitment to deploy all the State’s efforts to achieve peace and security with zero impunity and full justice,” she wrote.\n\nManzo had been Uruapan’s mayor since September 2024.\n\nSince taking office, Manzo, often seen wearing a bulletproof vest, had called on the federal government to do more to fight organised crime while expressing fears for his safety.\n\n“I don’t want to be just another mayor on the list of those executed, those whose lives have been taken from them,” Manzo said in an interview in September with Mexican journalist Joaquin Lopez-Doriga.\n\nUruapan has been called Mexico’s avocado capital because it sits in the heart of Michoacan’s avocado-growing region. The industry has seen rapid growth due to booming US demand, making avocado production a target for organised criminal groups.\n\nMultiple politicians, including other mayors, and journalists have been killed in recent months and years.\n\n“How many mayors have they killed because they opposed making these pacts with organised crime?” Manzo asked in another September interview with Mexico’s Milenio TV. He appealed to Sheinbaum for stronger public security measures and said Uruapan’s avocado industry gave it importance ahead of a coming review of Mexico’s trade deal with the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to Harfuch, the security minister, Manzo had been under protection since December 2024, three months after taking office. His security was reinforced last May with municipal police and 14 National Guard officers, Harfuch said.\n\n“The aggressors took advantage of the vulnerability of a public event,” Harfuch said, referring to Manzo’s murder. “Be certain that there will be no impunity.”\n\nOfficials in the United States also condemned the killing.\n\n“The US stands ready to deepen security cooperation with Mexico to wipe out organised crime on both sides of the border,” Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau wrote on X, sharing a photo of Manzo with his young son shortly before the mayor’s murder.\n\nThe mayor’s killing follows the death of Salvador Bastidas, mayor of the municipality of Tacambaro, also in Michoacan. Bastidas was killed in June along with his bodyguard as he arrived at his home in the town’s Centro neighbourhood.\n\nIn October 2024, journalist Mauricio Cruz Solis was also shot in Uruapan shortly after interviewing Manzo."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/3/live-israel-kills-palestinian-in-gaza-city-hamas-returns-3-bodies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"Israeli air strikes hit southern Gaza; two Palestinians killed in West Bank","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli air strikes have resumed in southern Gaza, particularly in Khan Younis, while Israeli forces killed two Palestinians, including a teenager, in the occupied West Bank.

Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of committing war crimes in the country’s North Darfur state, as survivors who escaped the city of el-Fasher recounted mass killings and sexual assault by the paramilitary troops.\n\nSudan’s ambassador to Egypt, Imadeldin Mustafa Adawi, made the allegations on Sunday as he accused the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of helping the RSF paramilitary group in the ongoing civil war.\n\nThe Gulf state denies the claim.\n\nAdawi’s remarks followed an earlier statement by Sudanese Prime Minister Kamil Idris, who told the Swiss newspaper Blick that the RSF should be tried in the international courts.\n\nBut Kamil rejected the “illegal” idea of foreign troops being deployed to his country, which has been ravaged by a civil war between the RSF and the Sudanese army since April 2023.\n\nThe calls for action come a week after the RSF seized the capital of North Darfur, el-Fasher, after an 18-month siege and starvation campaign, resulting in thousands of reported civilian deaths. The city was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in the region.\n\nIn the days since its capture, survivors have reported mass executions, pillaging, rape and other atrocities, sparking an international outcry.\n\nThe Sudanese government said that at least 2,000 people were killed, but witnesses said the real number could be much higher.\n\nTens of thousands of civilians are still believed to be trapped in the city.\n\n“The government of Sudan is calling on the international community to act immediately and effectively rather than just make statements of condemnation,” Adawi told reporters during a news conference in the Egyptian capital, Cairo.\n\nThe envoy urged the world to designate the RSF as a “terrorist” organisation, as well as condemn RSF “for committing massacres amounting to genocide” and denounce “its official regional financier and supporter, the United Arab Emirates”.\n\nHe also said that Sudan would not take part in talks led by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United States and the UAE to end the conflict if the latter remains part of the negotiations.\n\n“We do not consider them [the UAE] as a mediator and someone reliable on the issue,” Adawi stressed.\n\nThe UAE, however,  denies allegations  that it is supplying the RSF with weapons.\n\nAt a forum in Bahrain’s capital, Manama, an Emirati presidential adviser said that the Gulf state wants to help end the war, and acknowledged that regional and international powers could have done more to prevent the conflict in Sudan.\n\n“We all made the mistake, when the two generals who are fighting the civil war today overthrow the civilian government. That was, in my opinion, looking back, a critical mistake,” Anwar Gargash said.\n\nEgypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the US, as mediators, have all condemned the mass killings and called for increased humanitarian assistance.\n\nAs the world’s worst humanitarian crisis further spirals into chaos, residents who managed to escape el-Fasher recalled their harrowing experience.\n\nAdam Yahya, who fled with four of his children, told Al Jazeera that his wife was killed in an RSF drone strike shortly before el-Fasher fell. He said that he and his children barely had time to mourn before they found themselves on the run from the paramilitary group.\n\n“The streets were full of dead people. We made it to one of the sand barriers set up by the RSF. They were shooting at people, men, women and children, with machineguns. I heard one saying, ‘Kill them all, leave no one alive’,” Yahya recounted.\n\n“We ran back and hid. At night, I slowly crept out with my children and crossed the barrier. We walked to a village, where someone took pity on us and gave us a ride to the camp here.”\n\nAnother 45-year-old woman in the displacement camp of Al Dabbah in Sudan’s Northern State told Al Jazeera that RSF fighters sexually assaulted her.\n\nThe woman, who only gave her first name, Rasha, said she left her daughters at home when the RSF seized the army headquarters on Sunday and went to look for her sons.\n\n“The RSF asked me where I was going, and I told them I’m looking for my sons. They forced me into a house and started sexually assaulting me. I told them I’m old enough to be their mother. I cried,” she said.\n\n“They then let me go, and I took my daughters and fled, leaving my sons behind. I don’t know where they are now,” she said.\n\n“We just fled and ran past dead bodies till we crossed the barrier and reached a small village outside el-Fasher,” she added.\n\nAid agencies, meanwhile, said that thousands of people are unaccounted for after fleeing el-Fasher.\n\nCaroline Bouvard, the Sudan country director for Solidarites International, said that only a few hundred more people have turned up in Tawila, the closest town to el-Fasher, in the past few days.\n\n“Those are very small numbers considering the number of people who were stuck in el-Fasher. We keep hearing feedback that people are stuck on the roads and in different villages that are unfortunately still inaccessible due to security reasons,” she said.\n\nBouvard said there is a “complete blackout” in terms of information coming out of el-Fasher after the RSF takeover, and that aid agencies are getting their information from surrounding areas, where up to 15,000 people are believed to be stuck.\n\n“There’s a strong request for advocacy with the different parties to ensure that humanitarian aid can reach these people or that, at least, we can send in trucks to bring them back to Tawila,” she added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2910-02-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, including the impact of climate change on ecosystems (e.g., mosquitoes in Iceland), public health efforts (e.g., HPV vaccination in Pakistan), and emerging technological risks such as AI-driven misinformation and cloud platform outages.

another Palestinian in Gaza; Hamas returns 3 bodies\n\nIsraeli forces have killed another Palestinian in Gaza despite a United States-brokered ceasefire, bringing the toll since the truce to 236, as Hamas handed over the remains of three more captives.\n\nMedics said on Sunday that the Palestinian man was killed in an Israeli drone attack on the Shujayea neighbourhood of Gaza City, where Israeli forces have been carrying out building demolitions since the morning.\n\nThe Israeli military said the man had crossed the “yellow line” marking the ceasefire boundary and approached its troops, without offering evidence.\n\nAccording to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, Israeli forces have killed at least 236 Palestinians and wounded 600 others since the ceasefire took effect last month.\n\nIt said the bodies of 502 Palestinians have also been retrieved from under the rubble of destroyed homes and buildings since the truce, taking the overall death toll from Israel’s war to 68,856 people.\n\nHamas, meanwhile, announced handing over the remains of three captives to Israel via the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed receiving the bodies.\n\nThe Times of Israel said the remains will be examined at the Abu Kabir forensic institute in Tel Aviv and that the identification process could take up to two days.\n\nIsrael must now return the bodies of 45 dead Palestinian prisoners, 15 for each Israeli captive returned.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Nour Odeh, reporting from Amman in neighbouring Jordan, said the recovery of the bodies followed a “complex search operation”.\n\nThe search is currently happening beyond the “Yellow Line”, with Hamas fighters entering with ICRC staff, aided by “outside heavy machinery as these bodies lie under the rubble”, Odeh said.\n\n“Now, the Israeli destruction of homes continues in those areas, whether its in Bani Suheila, where the bodies of the three captives were found this Sunday, or in the Shujayea neighbourhood, east of Gaza City, where the search continues for more bodies of Israeli captives,” she said.\n\nExperts and US officials expect the search for the remaining eight to be even more complicated.\n\n“There are hundreds of tonnes of rubble in Gaza, and it is not going to be sure whether Hamas will be able to locate all of those bodies,” Odeh said. “It will be up to the [US President Donald] Trump administration to steer the ceasefire forward, because Israel conditions moving to phase 2 [of the ceasefire] on the return of all the bodies of Israeli captives.”\n\nThe developments came as tensions heightened in Gaza after the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) accused Hamas of looting an aid truck in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, without providing evidence. The claim followed the release of drone footage allegedly showing “suspected Hamas elements” commandeering humanitarian supplies.\n\nGaza’s Government Media Office dismissed the allegations, accusing Washington of spreading disinformation to smear Palestinian authorities.\n\n“This accusation is completely false and fabricated from its very foundation, and comes within the framework of a systematic media disinformation campaign aimed at distorting the image of the Palestinian police forces,” the media office said.\n\nIt added that Gaza’s police “are carrying out their national and humanitarian duty in securing aid and protecting relief convoys”, despite Israel’s continued interference.\n\n“The police system is making every effort to control matters despite continued Israeli meddling in the internal arena, with several objectives, including engineering starvation by obstructing the delivery of aid,” the statement added.\n\nHospitals in Gaza, already crippled by months of war and blockade, remain overwhelmed. More than 16,500 patients in need of specialised treatment remain trapped inside the besieged enclave, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nA recent United Nations update showed that by September, Egypt had taken in the largest number of Palestinian evacuees for medical care – nearly 4,000 people. The United Arab Emirates received 1,450 patients, Qatar received 970, and Turkiye took in 437.\n\nIn Europe, Italy treated 201 Palestinian patients – the highest among European states – but thousands more, including 3,800 children, are still waiting for urgent medical evacuation abroad.\n\nA study published in The Lancet medical journal this week underscored the human toll of  Israel’s genocide  in Gaza. The report found that Gaza has lost more than a staggering three million years of human life since the start of the conflict in October 2023.\n\nResearchers Sammy Zahran of Colorado State University and Ghassan Abu Sittah of the American University of Beirut analysed data from 60,199 recorded deaths between October 2023 and July 2025. Each death, they calculated, represented an average of 51 years of life lost – the majority being civilians.\n\nMore than one million of those life-years were lost among children under the age of 15. The authors noted that their estimates were conservative and excluded deaths caused by starvation, lack of medicine, and the collapse of infrastructure under Israel’s siege.\n\nWith winter approaching, Gaza’s displaced families are scrambling to rebuild any form of shelter amid Israel’s restrictions on building materials, Al Jazeera’s Ibrahim Al Khalili reported from Gaza City.\n\nIn Gaza’s largest urban centre, the focus of Israeli carpeting bombing from August to October this year, 42-year-old Khalid al-Dahdouh, a father of five, has turned to traditional methods to erect a small mud shelter for his family, using bricks salvaged from the rubble.\n\n“We tried to rebuild because winter is coming,” al-Dahdouh told Al Jazeera. “We managed to lay just a few rows of bricks – we don’t have tents or anything else. So, we built a primitive structure out of mud since there’s no cement. As you can see, it protects us from the cold, insects, and rain – unlike the tents.”\n\n“We’re just trying to survive the cold and the hunger. Ceasefire or not, Gaza is still under attack,” al-Dahdouh said.\n\nInspired by him, his relative, Saif al-Bayek, attempted a similar effort but ran out of usable materials before finishing.\n\n“The whole neighbourhood is in ruins,” al-Bayek said. “We made the shelter out of mud using traditional methods, using whatever stones we could salvage, since there weren’t enough to build a full room. Because of this, the structure is uneven, and the roof is full of gaps – if it rains heavily, water will come through.”\n\n“There are severe challenges to reconstruction efforts. Many families are forced to rely on primitive building methods because they have no other choice,” Alessandro Mrakic, the UN Development Programme’s representative in Gaza, told Al Jazeera.\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of people still displaced, aid agencies warn that the situation could deteriorate further as temperatures drop.\n\nWhile the ceasefire has halted large-scale bombardments, Palestinians in Gaza say their suffering continues – through hunger, homelessness, and the constant fear that Israel’s war could reignite at any moment."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/hurricane-melissa-now-category-3-threatens-heavy-floods-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:51:09+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa, now Category 4, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, now a powerful Category 4 storm, is threatening catastrophic flooding and landslides in Jamaica and southern Haiti, with possible intensification to Category 5.

Haiti\n\nHurricane Melissa  has rapidly strengthened into a major Category 4 with potentially catastrophic consequences, as it dropped torrential rain in the northern Caribbean and threatened disastrous flooding and landslides in Jamaica and southern Haiti.\n\nMelissa could intensify to a Category 5 as it nears Jamaica, forecasters said on Sunday, when making landfall in the Caribbean island in the coming day or two.\n\n“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”\n\nMelissa was centred about 200km (125 miles) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about  455km (280 miles) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, late Saturday night.\n\nIt had maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour (115 miles per hour), the hurricane centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.\n\nIn Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.\n\n“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.\n\nThe storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.\n\nThe Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/705224359","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:45.123Z","title":"Human Rights in Immigration Policy: A Global Shift","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article, published on April 15, 2023, examines the increasing emphasis on human rights in immigration and migration policy, particularly in the European Union and within the framework of the Global Compact on Migration.

Daylight saving time officially ends at 2 a.m. local time on Sunday, Nov. 2. And while many rejoice over the extra hour of sleep that comes with \"falling back,\" messing with our body clock  takes a toll . In fact, the shift in your body's sleep-wake cycle can disrupt your sleep for several days.  Being underslept has a long list of downsides. The  evidence  has piled up. Without adequate sleep, we set ourselves up for increased risk of  anxiety ,  depression ,  weight gain , even  dementia . So if you're trying to adjust to the time change or are just ready to change your sleeping habits overall, what can you do?  It turns out, nighttime rituals can take you only so far. Getting good sleep is very much dependent on your daytime routines, beginning the moment you wake up. So in addition to committing eight hours to your bed each night, here are five things you can do during the day to sleep better tonight. 1. Open the blinds, or better yet, go outside! Try to start your day with a bath of sunlight. Open the blinds. And if you can, go outside for at least 20 minutes in the early to mid-morning hours. Studies show that daylight exposure in the morning tends to lead to better sleep at night. \"Daylight is one of the most powerful resetters of our 24-hour clock,\" says  Matthew Walker , a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley and founder of the  Center for Human Sleep Science .  \"When daylight comes through the eyes, it actually turns the faucet off on melatonin,\" Walker explains. As melatonin diminishes, \"your brain now realizes, 'Oh, it must be daytime,' \" Walker says. It's your body's natural wake-up call. One study,  published in 2017 in the journal Sleep Health , found that office workers who were exposed to more light in the hours between 8 a.m. and noon were able to fall asleep more quickly and sleep more soundly compared with people who were exposed to less light.  2. Give up the afternoon latte. (Yes, really!)  Even if you think you're one of those people who can drink coffee after dinner and sleep just fine, you're probably a little wrong. \"I think people misunderstand caffeine and how it works with sleep,\" Walker says. There's a compound found in our bodies and brains called adenosine. Walker calls it \"the sleepiness chemical.\" You want it to build up throughout the day so that you're ready to sleep when your head hits the pillow. But caffeine can latch onto the receptors for adenosine. \"Caffeine comes into your system, and it hits the mute button on the adenosine signal of sleepiness, so it wakes you up,\" Walker says. The half-life of caffeine — meaning the time it takes for your body to eliminate half of the caffeine you consume — is about five to seven hours. Walker says that if you have a cup of coffee at 4 p.m., by the time you're ready to go to sleep, half the caffeine may still be circulating in your system. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A study  published in the   Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine  found that when people consumed caffeine even six hours prior to bedtime, it significantly disturbed their sleep compared with those who consumed a placebo.   Some people fall asleep just fine after consuming caffeine, but Walker says there may be a downside. He says research has shown that when you give people a standard cup of coffee, even if they fall asleep, they get less deep sleep.  \"I think people need to be quite mindful of the timing of their caffeine,\" Walker says — and think about putting the brakes on caffeinated drinks by late morning. 3. Move your body and get tired. As hard as it may be to fit a workout routine into your day, it's worth it. Exercise may help promote good sleep in two ways. Physical activity is known to  reduce anxiety , so this alone may contribute to good sleep. (If you want extra help to reduce the late-night ruminating, check out this  Life Kit  episode on  CBT-I for sleep .) In addition, exercise can physically tire you out. A lot of studies demonstrate the link between physical activity and improved sleep. A  meta-analysis  published in the  Journal of Behavioral Medicine  concluded that regular exercise improves the quality of sleep, helps people fall asleep faster and even helps people sleep a little longer.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Walker also points to evidence from a study of older adults who were not in the habit of exercising. Four months after starting a program to increase their physical activity, they tended to sleep more — up to about an hour more per night. \"If you add that one hour up week after week, month after month, decade after decade, it's like compounding interest on a loan — that it really starts to increase in terms of a long-term, escalating impact,\" Walker says. Bonus: While we're on the topic of healthy habits, eating well can also help tamp down anxiety, and this in turn may help improve sleep. Research shows that three weeks of  adhering to a Mediterranean-style diet  rich in fruits and vegetables and lower in processed foods and refined carbohydrates led to a reduction in depression and anxiety in a group of young adults.  4. Limit your evening alcohol intake. Have you ever crashed after a night of drinking, only to wake up suddenly in the middle of the night? Yep, alcohol has some counterintuitive influences on our sleep. \"Many people see alcohol as a sleep aid,\" Walker says. \"Unfortunately, it's one of the greatest misunderstood substances when it comes to sleep. It is not a sleep aid at all.\" For starters, Walker says alcohol can block or interfere with deep sleep, making our sleep more fragmented. There's a lot of research showing  alcohol's bad effects on sleep . After a night of drinking, REM sleep — the stage of sleep in which you dream more — tends to be suppressed. This may be especially true during the first part of the night, when there's still alcohol in the bloodstream. Walker says even one glass of wine at dinner can have an effect. That doesn't mean you should never indulge, but make an informed choice. \"I don't want to sound puritanical,\" Walker says. \"You know life is to be lived to an extent. It's all about checks and balances.\" And one more thing to keep in mind: Walker points to  one study that shows  alcohol can also dampen our ability to consolidate new memories. \"What they found is that alcohol, if you disrupted sleep the first night after learning, it washed away about 50% of the memory. So you were only able to save 50% of what you learned,\" he says. 5. Make your bedroom a screen-free, peaceful refuge. Lots of us are tethered to our devices. But these electronics can expose us to light, which can prevent or slow down the release of the sleep hormone melatonin. That's the hormone that signals to our brain that it's time to start dozing off. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So really try (and we mean this!) to read from an old-fashioned book or paper magazine at bedtime. Walker says that when researchers have compared \"one hour of iPad reading versus one hour of just reading in dim light with just a paper book, the iPad actually [significantly] blocked the release of melatonin.\"  \"Normally when the sun goes down and the lights turn off, our body releases melatonin, which helps us get a nice, restful sleep,\"  Lisa Ostrin , an associate professor at the University of Houston College of Optometry,  told NPR's Jon Hamilton in 2017 . \"But when we have all this artificial light on, it's tricking those photoreceptors into thinking it's still daytime.\" Alissa Escarce produced the audio version of this story, which was originally published on March 25, 2019. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n         \n         Transcript \n         ALLISON AUBREY, HOST:  You know the downside of not getting enough sleep? Let me tell you it is a scary long list. I'm a health reporter, and every week, I see a new study. Lack of sleep - it's linked to anxiety, depression, weight gain, Type 2 diabetes, even certain kinds of cancer. MATTHEW WALKER: If you understood the damage that insufficient sleep has on the brain and the body as I do, you would choose to do nothing else. It's purely a selfish act on my behalf that I give myself that eight-hour sleep. AUBREY: That is sleep guru Matthew Walker. He's a sleep researcher at UC Berkeley and the author of \"Why We Sleep.\" He has made it his mission to convince the world that sleep is important. What is it that you've found over the years that really gets people's attention? WALKER: I think it's different facts for different populations. You know, for example, sometimes, I'll go and speak to a lot of Fortune 500 companies where there is a large dominance of sort of Type A males in the audience. One of the first things I usually say in those speeches is regarding testicles - that men who sleep five to six hours a night have significantly smaller testicles than those... AUBREY: (Laughter). WALKER: ...Who sleep seven hours or more. In addition... AUBREY: Oh, I'm sure that gets their attention. WALKER: Yeah. It's the best opening that I've found yet. Testicles is probably one of the best hooks for maintaining people's attention. AUBREY: (Laughter) Yeah. Hook them with small testicles. WALKER: Yep. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUBREY: So clearly, all kinds of things can happen to you if you don't get enough sleep. But scientists have also learned a lot about how to get those eight hours in and how to improve the quality of our sleep. And it turns out that process starts from the moment you wake up. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUBREY: This is your NPR LIFE KIT for getting better sleep. I'm Allison Aubrey. I cover health and wellness here at NPR. And in this episode, we've got five things for you to do today to help you sleep better tonight. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUBREY: There is plenty to be said about good nighttime routines for bed. But in this episode, we will focus on how your daytime habits influence your sleep. One thing you need to know is you may not feel tired until 9 or 10 o'clock tonight, but your body started to prepare for sleep first thing this morning. WALKER: From the moment that everyone woke up this morning that's listening to this, a chemical started building up in your brain. And that chemical is called adenosine, and it is the sleepiness chemical. And the longer that you're awake, the more of that sleepiness chemical builds up in the brain. And after about 16 hours of being awake, there should be enough of that healthy sleepiness sort of swilling around within your brain - enough of what we call sleep pressure - to then make you feel ready to fall asleep and then stay asleep for eight hours. AUBREY: Is it really that direct? Is there really this compound that says, you are drowsy now? WALKER: There is. AUBREY: My biology is telling me to go to sleep. WALKER: Yeah. And it's during that eight hours of sleep that the brain then starts to clear away and remove all of that adenosine, all of that sleepiness chemical. AUBREY: And now you're ready to wake up. But here's the problem. In our society where it's go, go, go 24/7, lots of us override our internal body clocks. We just ignore these signals to sleep. What do I mean? Well, let's walk through a typical day. So let's say it's morning. The sun is shining. But where are you? Many of us start our day in our dark bedrooms. Then we stop by a dark coffee shop. Then we get into our indoor cubicles, where there's no natural light. So what's missing? WALKER: Daylight is perhaps one of the most powerful resetters of our 24-hour clock. So we need things like daylight just to keep us regular, to keep the precision of our 24-hour clock bang on the money. AUBREY: So go ahead - pull open those curtains. Or better yet, go outside because natural light is the best kind of light. WALKER: When daylight floods into the brain, it tends to put the brakes on a hormone called melatonin. And melatonin is the darkness hormone. It's the hormone that circulates in your brain and your body and, like a chemical bullhorn, shouts out to all of the cells of your brain and your body, it's nighttime. You should be asleep. But when daylight comes through the eyes, it actually turns the faucet off on melatonin. So there's no more melatonin being released. So your brain now realizes, oh, it must be daytime. AUBREY: It's time to wake up. So how much light do you really need in the morning? WALKER: Try to make sure to get outside for at least 20 minutes during the early- to mid-morning hours to infuse your brain with daylight. These data in these scientific studies are now well-replicated that having daylight exposure in the morning tends to lead to better sleep in the evening. AUBREY: OK. So your next habit to reconsider - caffeine. If you're like me, you get to the office. You have a cup of coffee, maybe another one. Here at NPR, it's free. It is super popular. And certainly, that cup of coffee at 10 a.m. - it can't really interfere with my sleep tonight, right? WALKER: So I think people misunderstand caffeine and how it works with sleep. The way caffeine works is that it enters your system, and it latches onto the receptors of adenosine. And you'll remember we were talking about adenosine... AUBREY: We were talking about that. That's... WALKER: Right. AUBREY: ...Exactly the thing you want to build up to help you sleep. WALKER: That's right. So adenosine is the sleepiness chemical. So essentially, caffeine comes into your system, and it hits the mute button on the adenosine signal of sleepiness, so it wakes you up. Now, the issue with caffeine is that it has a half-life of about six hours in most people. It has a quarter-life of twelve hours. What I mean by that is if you have a cup of coffee at noon, a quarter of that caffeine is still circulating in your brain at midnight. AUBREY: Now, some of you may not think this applies to you. And some people are way more sensitive to caffeine than others. But Walker says even if you don't get the caffeine jitters, it can still interrupt the quality of your sleep. WALKER: Some people will say to me, look. I can have an espresso after dinner. And I fall asleep. And I stay asleep. So no harm, no foul. I'm OK. And the answer is maybe not. We've done these studies where we give people a standard cup of coffee - a dose of, let's say, 180, 200 milligrams of caffeine. Then we put you to bed. And then we measure your sleep. And what we find is that even if you fall asleep and stay asleep, the amount of deep sleep that you get is reduced by about 20 percent. AUBREY: Ah, so even those people who say I can drink coffee right before I go to bed - they're not exactly right. WALKER: They're not exactly right because they end up shortchanging their brain in terms of that deep sleep. AUBREY: And hopefully, if this helps you sleep better, maybe you don't need that 2 p.m. latte. So the bottom line - and this is your take home number two - you want to try to put the brakes on caffeine by late morning. WALKER: I think people need to be quite mindful of the timing of their caffeine. And the advice usually would be try to stop drinking caffeine about 14 hours before you expect to go to bed. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUBREY: Now let's talk about exercise. It's 5:15. I'm trying to get to the spin class at NPR. But everything is going crazy at home. I've got last-minute things to do to work. I'm going to miss it today. So how will missing out on my workout interfere with my sleep tonight? WALKER: So the relationship between sleep and exercise is quite well understood. And it's bidirectional, in fact. AUBREY: What do you mean, bidirectional? WALKER: Well, we started off thinking that exercise had a beneficial impact on sleep. And the answer was yes, it does. But what was even perhaps more powerful statistically was that better sleep at night predicted a greater likelihood that you would actually exercise at all the next day. AUBREY: So sleep begets exercise. And exercise... WALKER: Exercise begets sleep. AUBREY: Now, exercise may help promote sleep in two ways. Physical activity is known to reduce anxiety. So that can help you sleep better. And exercise can also physically tire you out. That can make you sleepy, too. And just to give you a sense of how beneficial exercise can be, Matthew Walker writes in his book about a study of a group of older adults who had sleep issues. They found that after four months of increased physical activity, they were sleeping about an hour more on average per night. WALKER: If you add that one hour up week after week, month after month, decade after decade, it's like compounding interest on a loan - that it really starts to sort of increase and become quite voluminous in terms of a long-term escalating impact. AUBREY: OK, so bottom line - I should get to that 5:15 cycling class. Is that what you're telling me? WALKER: I am. (LAUGHTER) AUBREY: So one thing to keep in mind here is that you don't want to exercise too close to bedtime. It can be overstimulating. But the big takeaway here is exercise can help you get better sleep. WALKER: Always try and get some exercise if you can for better sleep. But just try not to make it in the last two hours before you go to bed. Usually, that can actually be, for some people, a little deleterious. AUBREY: OK, so where does this leave us? We're going to get more morning light. We're going to cut back on caffeine. We're going to get to that 5:15 cycling class. Now, what about happy hour? I know a lot of us wind down in the evening with a glass of wine or a beer or two. So what's the skinny on alcohol and sleep? WALKER: Many people see alcohol as a sleep aid. Unfortunately, it's one of the greatest misunderstood substances when it comes to sleep. It is not a sleep aid at all. AUBREY: It turns out that after an evening of drinking, Walker says our sleep can become fragmented. We tend to wake up more often. And our sleep can be less restful. WALKER: Alcohol is a very good drug at blocking your dream sleep. AUBREY: Wow, so you don't even get the REM sleep when you're drinking alcohol? WALKER: That's right, yeah. Or you get it, but you are shortchanged of a lot of it. This is why a lot of people will tell me, you know, at the weekend, I had a bit too much to drink on Friday. And then I slept in late on Saturday morning. And I was having these bizarre dreams. And I don't know why. And the answer is this - that the alcohol was in your system for the first six or seven hours whilst your liver and kidneys were trying to break it down. And during that time, no REM sleep or very little REM sleep. And when you finally get rid of the alcohol in your system, not only in the last few hours do you get the REM sleep that you were going to have, you get that plus a rebound where the brain tries to get back some of what it's lost. And that explains why you have these really bizarre, really intense dreams after a few too many drinks at night. AUBREY: And it's not just crazy dreams. Alcohol can get in the way of you consolidating new memories. You know, you write about a study in the book where people were given, I think, three shots of vodka - I guess vodka and orange juice. And they were asked to do some kind of memory task - memorize something. And the researchers found that the ability to memorize the material was greatly reduced when people in the study had something to drink. That was really eye-opening to me. WALKER: It's frightening, isn't it? It's the sleep after learning that essentially hits the save button on those new memories. And what they found is that alcohol, if you disrupt its sleep the first night after learning, it washed away about 50 percent of the memory. So you were only able to save 50 percent of what you learned rather than 100 percent. AUBREY: It's really shocking. I mean, it's almost like saying sleep can help you consolidate memory. But drinking alcohol, even having two shots of vodka, can almost counteract it. WALKER: That's right. You're taking away sleep's benefit - that you are essentially inducing a state of sleep-impaired amnesia. AUBREY: But there's got to be some amount of alcohol that's OK. I mean, does this happen after only having, say, a glass of wine with dinner? Please tell me no. WALKER: Sadly, it does. AUBREY: One glass of wine? WALKER: We can see it even after - yup. AUBREY: No. WALKER: So we've done some of these studies where even just one glass of wine, you can see the - there is a blast radius on sleep. And... AUBREY: Wow. That is really bad news for a lot of people. WALKER: You know, I think it's really important for me to say this. All I'm trying to provide you with here is the scientific data so that people listening can make an informed choice. I don't want to sound puritanical. You know, life is to be lived. To an extent, it's all about sort of checks and balances. So just keep this information in mind. But also, you know, just be relaxed about some things, too. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUBREY: OK. So now the day is coming to an end. And the last habit you might want to think about changing has to do with what you bring to bed with you. So I've got my laptop. I've got my iPhone. Maybe I've got my iPad with me. I'm going to send one more work email, maybe binge on the last episode of my favorite show. What is wrong with this picture? WALKER: So what's happening there is, essentially, you're just creating a state of stress. And that state of stress sort of translates biologically or physiologically to an activation of what's called your fight-or-flight branch of the nervous system. And it's that branch of the nervous system that actually needs to switch off for you to be able to fall asleep. AUBREY: Well, maybe I just want to read my novel on my iPad. I mean, that's not stressful. But I've heard that this blue light can be a problem. Is it? WALKER: What we've found with studies with one hour of iPad reading versus one hour of just reading in dim light with just a paper book, the iPad actually blocked the release of melatonin by 50 percent - five-zero. So you halved the amount of sleep timing chemical within the brain. AUBREY: Wow, that's really surprising. Was that surprising to you? WALKER: Yeah, it was surprising. I think the most surprising result was the timing of it. It wasn't just that the peak of the melatonin was blunted. But when that spike of melatonin arrived was actually three hours later into the night. AUBREY: In other words, all those devices in your bedroom can delay the onset of your sleep. And what you're really trying to do is wind down. So before you put your head on your pillow tonight, remember, falling asleep is a kind of complicated biological process. And it takes some time. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUBREY: So now your day really has come to an end. And Matthew Walker says you really want to aim to give yourself that eight-hour window every night. He says think of it this way. We evolved to sleep. WALKER: Every species that we've studied to date appears to sleep. What that means is that sleep probably evolved with life itself on this planet. And from that point forward, it has heroically fought its way through every step along the evolutionary pathway. That must mean that if sleep does not serve an absolutely vital set of functions, then it is the biggest mistake that the evolutionary process has ever made. AUBREY: And if that doesn't make it seem important, what possibly could? So remember, you want to tweak your habits during the day. It really can make getting that sleep you need at night a little easier. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUBREY: So you ready to make a change? Let's recap what we've learned. Take away number one, start the day with a splash of sunlight. WALKER: There is good evidence that morning exposure to daylight helps you sleep better. You get more consistent sleep. And the quality of that sleep tends to be better, as well. So get that good morning daylight. AUBREY: Takeaway number two, don't overdo the caffeine. It can interrupt your sleep even if you don't notice it. WALKER: Trying to cut caffeine off somewhere between 12 to 14 hours before you expect to go to bed is a fantastic rule of thumb. AUBREY: Takeaway number three, exercise can increase the quantity and the quality of your sleep. WALKER: Exercise during the day as long as it's not too close to sleep at night is sleep promoting. And when you get good sleep, you are far more likely to exercise the following day, as well. It's a golden reciprocal loop. AUBREY: And takeaway number four, you might want to cut out the nightcap. WALKER: It's a hard piece of advice. It makes me deeply unpopular. But sound sleep usually comes after a night of no alcohol. AUBREY: And finally, at bedtime, get those devices out of your bedroom. WALKER: Try to avoid screens and screen time at least an hour before bed. And if you can, keep those devices out of the room. AUBREY: Instead, try reading an old-fashioned book. You know, the kind printed on paper. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUBREY: That's it for this episode of LIFE KIT. Be sure to check out our next episode. It's about rituals for falling asleep.

flooding\n\nTropical Storm Melissa has strengthened into a  hurricane , the United States-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) says, as people across several Caribbean countries braced for heavy rainfall and dangerous flooding.\n\nHurricane Melissa was located about 380km (235 miles) southwest of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres (75

chance”.\n\nAuthorities have readied more than 650 emergency shelters across Jamaica and said airports will close once a hurricane warning is declared.

numbered.\n\nAsked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly.\"\n\nHis comments come as the US continues to launch strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean. The Trump administration says the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US.\n\nTrump rejected suggestions that the US action was not about stopping narcotics, but aimed at ousting Maduro, a long-time Trump opponent, saying it was about \"many things\".\n\nAt least 64 people have been killed by US strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September, CBS News - the BBC's US news partner - reported.\n\nSpeaking from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, Trump said: \"Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"\n\nPushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\"\n\nMaduro has previously accused Washington of \"fabricating a new war\", while Colombian President Gustavo Petro has said the strikes on boats are being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.\n\nTrump said the government was \"not going to allow\" people \"from all over the world\" to come in.\n\n\"They come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America.

Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd673291pljo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"00:09:08.032+00:00","title":"South Africa AI: I created chatbot 'aunt' to help abused women after family tragedy","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Leonora Tima, a South African development sector professional, created the Gender Rights in Tech (Grit) app after the 2020 violent death of a 19-year-old relative, which highlighted the normalization of gender-based violence in South African society.

inspired South African Leonora Tima to create a digital platform where people, mostly women, can talk about and track abuse.\n\nLeonora's relative was just 19 years old, and nine months pregnant, when she was killed, her body dumped on the side of a highway near Cape Town in 2020.\n\n\"I work in the development sector, so I've seen violence,\" Leonora says. \"But what stood out for me was that my family member's violent death was seen as so normal in South African society.\n\n\"Her death wasn't published by any news outlet because the sheer volume of these cases in our country is such that it doesn't qualify as news.\"\n\nThe killer was never caught and what Leonora saw as the silent acceptance of a woman's violent death became the catalyst for her app, Gender Rights in Tech (Grit), which features a chatbot called Zuzi.\n\nThis is one of the first free AI tools made by African creators to tackle gender-based violence.\n\n\"This is an African solution co-designed with African communities,\" says Leonora.\n\nThe aim is to offer support and help gather evidence that could later be used in legal cases against abusers.\n\nThe initiative is gaining interest among international women's rights activists, although some caution that chatbots should not be used to replace human support, emphasising that survivors need empathy, understanding, and emotional connection that only a trained professional can provide.\n\nLeonora and her small team visited communities in the townships around her home in Cape Town, speaking to residents about their experiences of abuse and the ways technology fits into their lives.\n\nThey asked more than 800 people how they used their phones and social media to talk about violence, and what stopped them from seeking help.\n\nLeonora found that people wanted to talk about their abuse, but \"they were wary of traditional routes like the police\".\n\n\"Some women would post about it on Facebook and even tag their abuser, only to be served with defamation papers,\" she says.\n\nShe felt that existing systems were failing victims twice, first in failing to prevent the violence itself, and then again when victims tried to speak up.\n\nWith financial and technical support from Mozilla, the Gates Foundation, and the Patrick McGovern Foundation, Leonora and her team began developing Grit, a mobile app that could help people record, report and get a response to abuse while it was happening.\n\nThe app is free to use, though it requires mobile data to download it. Leonora's team says it has 13,000 users, and had about 10,000 requests for help in September.\n\nAt its core, Grit is built around three key features.\n\nOn the home screen is a large, circular help button. When pressed, it automatically starts recording 20 seconds of audio, capturing what's happening around the user. At the same time, it triggers an alert to a private rapid-response call centre - professional response companies are common in South Africa - where a trained operator calls the user.\n\nIf the caller needs immediate help, the response team either sends someone to the scene themselves or contacts an organisation local to the victim who can go to their aid.\n\nThe app was built with the needs of abuse survivors at its core, says Leonora: \"We need to earn people's trust. These are communities that are often ignored. We are asking a lot from people when it comes to sharing data.\"\n\nWhen asked whether the help feature has been misused, she admits there have been a few curious presses - people testing to see if it really works - but nothing she'd call abuse of the system.\n\n\"People are cautious. They're testing us as much as we're testing the tech,\" she says.\n\nThe second element of Grit is \"the vault\", which Leonora says is a secure digital space where users can store evidence of abuse, dated and encrypted, for possible use later in legal proceedings.\n\nPhotos, screenshots, and voice recordings can all be uploaded and saved privately, protecting crucial evidence from deletion or tampering.\n\n\"Sometimes women take photos of injuries or save threatening messages, but those can get lost or deleted,\" Leonora says. \"The vault means that evidence isn't just sitting on a phone that could be taken away or destroyed.\"\n\nThis month, Grit will expand again with the launch of its third feature - Zuzi, an AI-powered chatbot designed to listen, advise, and guide users to local community support.\n\n\"We asked people: 'Should it be a woman? Should it be a man? Should it be a robot? Should it sound like a lawyer, a social worker, a journalist, or another authority figure?'\" Leonora explains.\n\nPeople told them that they wanted Zuzi to be \"an aunt figure\" - someone warm and trustworthy, who they could confide in without fear of judgment.\n\nAlthough built primarily for women experiencing abuse, during the testing phase, Zuzi has also been used by men seeking help.\n\n\"Some conversations are from perpetrators, men asking Zuzi to teach them how to get help with their anger issues, which they often direct at their partners,\" Leonora explains. \"There are also men who are victims of violence and have used Zuzi to talk more openly about their experience.\n\n\"People like talking to AI because they don't feel judged by it,\" she adds. \"It's not a human.\"\n\nUN Women reports that South Africa experiences some of the world's highest levels of gender-based violence (GBV), with a femicide rate that is five times higher than the global average. Between 2015 and 2020, an average of seven women were killed every day, according to South African police.\n\nMany, including Lisa Vetten, a specialist in gender-based violence in South Africa, agree that it is inevitable that technology will play a role in addressing it.\n\nBut she also warns of caution around the use of AI in trauma-centred care.\n\n\"I call them Large Language Models, not artificial intelligence because they engage in linguistic analysis and prediction - nothing more,\" she says.\n\nShe can see how AI systems may be able to help, but knows of examples where other AI chatbots have given incorrect advice to women.\n\n\"I worry when they give women very confident answers to their legal problems,\" she says. \"Chatbots can provide helpful information but they are incapable of dealing with complex, multi-faceted difficulties.  Most importantly, they are not a substitute for human counselling. People who have been harmed need to be helped to trust and feel safe with other human beings.\"\n\nGrit's approach has drawn international attention.\n\nIn October, Leonora and her team presented their app at the Feminist Foreign Policy Conference hosted by the French government in Paris, where global leaders met to discuss how technology and policy can be used to build a more gender-equal world. At the conference, 31 countries signed a pledge to make tackling gender-based violence a key policy priority.\n\nConversations are buzzing around the use of AI, says Lyric Thompson, the founder and head of the Feminist Foreign Policy Collaborative, \"but the moment you try to include gender in the conversation, to raise the dangers of racist, sexist and xenophobic bias being baked in, eyes glaze over and the conversation shifts - likely to a back corridor where there aren't any pesky women around to raise it\".\n\nHeather Hurlburt - an associate fellow at Chatham House, specialising in AI and its use in tech - agrees that AI \"has enormous potential either to help identify and redress gender discrimination and gender-based violence, or to entrench misogyny and inequity\", but adds which way we go is \"very much up to us\".\n\nLeonora is clear that the success of AI to tackle gender-based violence depends not just on engineering, but on who gets to design technology in the first place.\n\nA 2018 World Economic Forum report found that only 22% of AI professionals globally were women, a statistic that is still often cited.\n\n\"AI as we know it now has been built with historic data that centres the voices of men, and white men in particular,\" Leonora says.\n\n\"The answer is not only about having more women creators. We also need creators who are women of colour, more from the global south, and more from less privileged socio-economic backgrounds.\"\n\nOnly then, Leonora Tima concludes, can technology begin to represent the realities of those who use it.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mosquitoes have been detected in Iceland for the first time, marking a significant ecological shift due to climate change.

detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ep044jz47o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"07:50:06.598+00:00","title":"Israel confirms Hamas returned bodies of three soldiers held hostage","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has confirmed the identities of three deceased Israeli soldiers — Col Asaf Hamami, Capt Omer Neutra, and Staff Sgt Oz Daniel — whose bodies were returned by Hamas via the Red Cross in Gaza.

eagerly awaited around the world\n\nWhat may be the biggest battle yet in Donald Trump's trade war is about to begin.\n\nThe Trump administration heads to the US Supreme Court on Wednesday, facing off against small businesses and a group of states who contend most of the tariffs it has put in place are illegal and should be struck down.\n\nIf the court agrees with them, Trump's trade strategy would be upended, including the sweeping global tariffs he first announced in April. The government would also likely have to refund some of the billions of dollars it has collected through the tariffs, which are taxes on imports.\n\nThe final decision from the justices will come after what could be months of poring over the arguments and discussing the merits of the case. Eventually they will hold a vote.\n\nTrump has described the fight in epic terms, warning a loss would tie his hands in trade negotiations and imperil national security.\n\nOn Sunday, the president said he will not attend the hearing in person as he did not want to cause a distraction.\n\n\"I wanted to go so badly... I just don't want to do anything to deflect the importance of that decision,\" he said. \"It's not about me, it's about our country.\"\n\nTrump previously said that if he does not win the case the US will be \"weakened\" and in a \"financial mess\" for many years to come.\n\nThe stakes feel just as high for many businesses in the US and abroad, which have been paying the price while getting whipped about by fast-changing policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs will cost Learning Resources, a US seller of toys made mostly overseas and one of the businesses suing the government, $14m (£10.66m) this year. That is seven times what it spent on tariffs in 2024, according to CEO Rick Woldenberg.\n\n\"They've thrown our business into unbelievable disruption,\" he said, noting the company has had to shift the manufacturing of hundreds of items since January.\n\nFew businesses, though, are banking on a win at the court.\n\n\"We are hopeful that this is going to be ruled illegal but we're all also trying to prepare that it's setting in,\" said Bill Harris, co-founder of Georgia-based Cooperative Coffees.\n\nHis co-op, which imports coffee from more than a dozen countries, has already paid roughly $1.3m in tariffs since April.\n\nIn deciding this case, the Supreme Court will have to take on a broader question: How far does presidential power go?\n\nLegal analysts say it is hard to predict the justices' answer, but a ruling siding with Trump will give him and future White House occupants greater reach.\n\nSpecifically, the case concerns tariffs that the Trump administration imposed using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the White House has embraced for its speed and flexibility.   By declaring an emergency under the law, Trump can issue immediate orders and bypass longer, established processes.\n\nTrump first invoked the law in February to tax goods from China, Mexico and Canada, saying drug trafficking from those countries constituted an emergency.\n\nHe deployed it again in April, ordering levies ranging from 10% to 50% on goods from   almost every country in the world. This time, he said the US trade deficit - where the US imports more than it exports - posed an \"extraordinary and unusual threat\".\n\nThose tariffs took hold in fits and starts this summer while the US pushed countries to strike \"deals\".\n\nOpponents say the law authorises the president to regulate trade but never mentions the word \"tariffs\", and they contend that only Congress can establish taxes under the US Constitution.\n\nThey have also challenged whether the issues cited by the White House, especially the trade deficit, represent emergencies.\n\nMembers of Congress from both parties have asserted the Constitution gives them responsibility for creating tariffs, duties and taxes, as well.\n\nMore than 200 Democrats in both chambers and one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski, filed a brief to the Supreme Court, where they also argued the emergency law did not grant the president power to use tariffs as a tool for gaining leverage in trade talks.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Senate made a symbolic and bipartisan move to pass three resolutions rejecting Trump's tariffs, including one to end the national emergency he declared. They are not expected to be approved in the House.\n\nStill, business groups said they hoped the rebuke would send a message to the justices.\n\nThree lower courts have ruled against the administration. After the Supreme Court hears arguments on Wednesday it will have until June to issue its decision, although most expect a ruling to come by January.\n\nWhatever it decides has implications for an estimated $90bn worth of import taxes already paid - roughly half the tariff revenue the US collected this year through September, according to Wells Fargo analysts.\n\nTrump officials have warned that sum could swell to $1tn if the court takes until June.\n\nIf the government is forced to issue refunds, Cooperative Coffees will \"absolutely\" try to recoup its money, said Mr Harris, but that would not make up for all the disruption.\n\nHis business has had to take out an extra line of credit, raise prices and find ways to survive with lower profits.\n\n\"This is an energy drain like I've never seen,\" said Mr Harris, who is also chief financial officer of Cafe Campesino, one of the 23 roasteries that own Cooperative Coffees. \"It dominates all the conversations and it just kind of sucks the life out of you.\"\n\nThe White House says that if it loses, it will impose levies via other means, such as a law allowing the president to put tariffs of up to 15% in place for 150 days.\n\nEven then, businesses would have some relief, since those other means require steps like issuing formal notices, which take time and deliberation, said trade lawyer Ted Murphy of Sidley Austin.\n\n\"This is not just about the money,\" he said. \"The president has announced tariffs on Sunday that go into effect on Wednesday, without advance notice, without any real process.\"\n\n\"I think that's the bigger thing for this case for businesses - whether or not that is going to be in our future,\" he added.\n\nThere is no clear sign of how the court will rule.\n\nIn recent years it has struck down major policies, such as Biden-era student loan forgiveness, as White House overreach.\n\nBut the nine justices, six of whom were appointed by Republicans, including three by Trump,   have shown deference to this president in other recent disputes and historically have given leeway to the White House on questions of national security.\n\n\"I really do think arguments are available for the Supreme Court to go in all different directions,\" said Greta Peisch, partner at Wiley and former trade lawyer in the Biden administration.\n\nAdam White, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he expected the court to strike down the tariffs, but avoid questions like what constitutes a national emergency.\n\nThe case has already complicated the White House's trade deals, such as one struck in July with the European Union.\n\nThe European Parliament is currently considering ratifying the agreement, which sets US tariffs on European goods at 15% in exchange for promises including  allowing in more US agricultural products.\n\n\"They're not going to act on this until they see the outcome of the Supreme Court decision,\" said John Clarke, former director for international trade at the European Commission.\n\nIn Switzerland, which recently downgraded its outlook for economic growth citing America’s 39% tariff on its goods, chocolatier Daniel Bloch said he'd welcome a ruling against the Trump administration.\n\nHis business Chocolats Camille Bloch is absorbing about a third of the cost of new tariffs on kosher chocolate that his firm has exported to the US for decades, aiming to blunt price increases and maintain sales. That decision has wiped out profits for the unit and is not sustainable, he said.\n\nHe hopes Trump will reconsider his tariffs altogether, because \"that would be easiest\".\n\n\"If the court were to make the tariffs go away of course we would see that as a positive sign,\" he said. \"But we don't trust that that will bring the solution.\"\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

coast are still desperately waiting for help.\n\nMany of the roads are blocked by debris and people are isolated with little food, no power or running water, and no idea of when normalcy will return.\n\nThe government said on Saturday that at least 28 people in Jamaica have died since the hurricane hit as a monster category five storm with 185 mph (297km/h) sustained winds.\n\nThat is a near 50% jump in the death toll overnight, and the number could rise as officials clear their way into new parts of the island in the coming days.\n\nLocal official Dr Dayton Campbell told the BBC 10 of those deaths were in Westmoreland.\n\nWestmoreland parish is believed to have the second highest number of unconfirmed deaths, after St Elizabeth to the south east. The eye of the storm hit somewhere between the two neighbouring parishes. At St Elizabeth an estimated 90% of homes have been destroyed.\n\nA long stretch of road headed west into Westmoreland Parish winds through a graveyard of trees – stacks of branches and limbs, cracked and twisted, blanketing the landscape for miles. It is grim evidence of Hurricane Melissa's ferocity - it was the strongest storm to strike the Caribbean island in modern history.\n\nPiles of debris are heaped on the parish's roadsides, next to battered buildings, shipping crates turned on their side and crowds of people wading through the destruction.\n\nOn Saturday morning, men with machetes hacked through branches as thick as their arms, clearing patches of the road where traffic jams were at a standstill.\n\nA policeman with an automatic weapon strapped to his chest, part of a convoy accompanying an aid truck on its way to Westmoreland, hopped out of his vehicle to help direct traffic.\n\n\"We don't know what lies ahead,\" the officer told the BBC, describing what he has seen as \"total devastation\".\n\nThose living in Whitehouse, a coastal town and commercial hub on the edge of Westmoreland Parish, say the wait for assistance is becoming frustrating.\n\nGary Williams said he has heard promises of incoming aid delivery, but \"they no turn up\".\n\nHe sat in the shade on a makeshift stool in front of a building barely standing – its entire roof gone – unsure of what to do next.\n\nWilliams said he lost his house in the storm and has \"nowhere to live\", suggesting he might sleep right where he is, outside on the front porch.\n\nAnother woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Words can't explain the situation that we're in. It's horrible. I don't even know what to say. So many hopeless, helpless and lifeless people here right now.\"\n\nAbout 400,000 people in Jamaica were without power as of Friday, and an untold number more have no access to cell phone service or Wi-Fi, cut off from the outside world.\n\nJamaica's transportation minister Daryl Vaz announced on Saturday that more than 200 StarLink devices have been deployed across the island to help people access the internet.\n\nHe addressed criticism the government has received for its response, saying there were \"several factors\" contributing to delays.\n\n\"Refuelling, Areas for Landing, Accessibility and Timing/Visibility,\" Vaz said on X.\n\nJamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged that the \"immediate focus is on clearing debris, restoring essential services\", as well as providing food and medical supplies.\n\nBut that would only solve part of the problem.\n\nIn a tiny community just outside of Whitehouse, Robert Morris rested against a slab of broken concrete. Behind him, the fishing village he has called home his entire life has been destroyed, along with his livelihood.\n\n\"We all devastated here, man,\" he said. He said the boat house was destroyed and is now \"flat\".\n\n\"Melissa take everything down,\" he said, including his fishing boat, which he describes as \"mashed up\".\n\nMorris also told of \"no help, no food, no water\".\n\n\"We just have to try and see what we can do,\" he said, adding that his plan was to find someone whose boat was still intact so that he could join and fish.\n\nEven then, he is not sure where he would sell his catch.\n\nThe people in these areas are filled with pride and resilience, words that are often repeated on local radio stations and visible through their optimism in the most difficult circumstances.\n\nSeated under the facade of a badly damaged building, Roy Perry said he has lost everything, but \"we have to just keep the faith and the hope is up still\".\n\n\"Can't give up. Not gonna give up,\" he said.\n\nIt is the same tone struck by Oreth Jones, a farmer sitting in the bed of his truck selling pears, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes – the last of his produce that was spared from the storm.\n\nOf his farm, he said: \"It's all wrecked. They all destroyed.\" But he quickly followed up with: \"We have to give God thanks we're alive.\"\n\nJones survived the strongest hurricane in Jamaican history while he was injured, wearing a homemade splint on his right leg from a fracture he suffered during a biking accident before Melissa hit.\n\nWhen asked about how the community will move forward, he said: \"Pray. Nothing else we can do. Nothing else.\"\n\nMeanwhile, foreign aid has now started entering into Jamaica.\n\nThe US State Department announced on Friday that its Disaster Assistance Response Team had arrived. And countries including the UK have also pledged millions in aid relief funds and emergency supplies."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp85zvne1m3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"06:50:34.727+00:00","title":"Air India plane crash survivor: 'I'm luckiest man alive'","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The sole survivor of the Air India plane crash that killed 241 people, Viswashkumar Ramesh, has spoken publicly for the first time since returning to Leicester, describing the 'miracle' of surviving while suffering severe physical and mental trauma, including PTSD, and the loss of his brother Ajay.

people on board, has said he feels like the \"luckiest man\" alive, but is also suffering physically and mentally.\n\nViswashkumar Ramesh walked away from the wreckage of the London-bound flight in Ahmedabad in extraordinary scenes that amazed the world.\n\nHe said it was a \"miracle\" he escaped but told how he has lost everything, as his younger brother Ajay was a few seats away on the flight and died in the crash in June.\n\nSince returning to his home in Leicester, Mr Ramesh has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), his advisers said, and has been unable to speak to his wife and four-year-old son.\n\nFlames engulfed the Boeing 787 flight when it went down shortly after take-off in western India.\n\nShocking video shared at the time showed Mr Ramesh walking away from the aftermath with seemingly superficial injuries, as smoke billowed in the background.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News, an emotional Mr Ramesh, whose first language is Gujarati, said: \"I'm only one survivor. Still, I'm not believing. It's a miracle.\n\n\"I lost my brother as well. My brother is my backbone. Last few years, he was always supporting me.\"\n\nHe described the devastating impact the ordeal has had on his family life.\n\n\"Now I'm alone. I just sit in my room alone, not talking with my wife, my son. I just like to be alone in my house,\" Mr Ramesh said.\n\nHe  spoke from his hospital bed in India  at the time, describing how he had managed to unbuckle himself and crawl out of the wreckage, and met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while receiving treatment for his injuries.\n\nOf the passengers and crew killed, 169 were Indian nationals and 52 were Britons, while 19 others were killed on the ground.\n\nA  preliminary report  into the crash, published by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in July, said fuel supply to the engines was cut off just seconds after take-off. Meanwhile, an investigation is ongoing and the airline said care for Mr Ramesh, and all families affected by the tragedy, \"remains our absolute priority\".\n\nThis is the first time the 39-year-old has spoken to the media since he has been back in the UK. Several news organisations were invited for an interview and a documentary crew was also filming in the room.\n\nThe BBC had detailed discussions with his advisers around his duty of care before the interview.\n\nWhen asked about his memories of the day of the crash, he said: \"I can't say anything about that now.\"\n\nFlanked by local community leader Sanjiv Patel and spokesman Radd Seiger, Mr Ramesh said it was too painful to recall the events of the disaster, and broke down during parts of an interview at the home of Mr Patel in Leicester.\n\nMr Ramesh described the anguish he and his family are now living through.\n\n\"For me, after this accident... very difficult.\n\n\"Physically, mentally, also my family as well, mentally... my mum last four months, she is sitting every day outside the door, not talking, nothing.\n\n\"I'm not talking to anyone else. I do not like to talk with anyone else.\n\n\"I can't talk about much. I'm thinking all night, I'm suffering mentally.\n\n\"Every day is painful for the whole family.\"\n\nMr Ramesh also spoke about the physical injuries he suffered in the crash, which saw him  escape his seat - 11A - through an opening in the fuselage .\n\nHe says he suffers pain in his leg, shoulder, knee and back, and has not been able to work or drive since the tragedy.\n\n\"When I walk, not walk properly, slowly, slowly, my wife help,\" he added.\n\nMr Ramesh was diagnosed with PTSD while he was being treated in hospital in India but has not received any medical treatment since being back home, his advisers said.\n\nThey described him as being lost and broken, with a long journey of recovery ahead, and are demanding a meeting with Air India's executives, claiming he has been treated poorly by the airline since the crash.\n\n\"They're in crisis, mentally, physically, financially,\" Mr Patel said.\n\n\"It's devastated his family.\n\n\"Whoever's responsible at the highest level should be on the ground meeting the victims of this tragic event, and understanding their needs and to be heard.\"\n\nAir India has offered an interim compensation payment to Mr Ramesh of £21,500, which has been accepted, but his advisers say this is not enough to meet his immediate needs.\n\nThe family fishing business in Diu in India, which Mr Ramesh ran with his brother before the crash, has since collasped, his advisers said.\n\nSpokesman for the family Mr Seiger said they had invited Air India for a meeting on three occasions, and all three were either \"ignored or turned down\".\n\nThe media interviews were the team's way of reissuing that appeal for the fourth time, he said.\n\nMr Seiger added: \"It's appalling that we are having to sit here today and putting him [Viswashkumar] through this.\n\n\"The people who should be sitting here today are the executives of Air India, the people responsible for trying to put things right.\n\n\"Please come and sit down with us so that we can work through this together to try and alleviate some of this suffering.\"\n\nIn a statement, the airline, which is owned by Tata Group, said senior leaders from the parent company continue to visit families to express their deepest condolences.\n\n\"An offer has been made to Mr Ramesh's representatives to arrange such a meeting, we will continue to reach out and we very much hope to receive a positive response,\" it said.\n\nThe airline told the BBC that this offer was made before the media interviews with Mr Ramesh."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv1ddevk9go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"08:30:04.008+00:00","title":"Tanzania elections: Samia Suluhu Hassan sworn in as president after unrest","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a highly contested election in Tanzania, President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been sworn in for a second term amid widespread allegations of fraud, violence, and lack of transparency.

AI mean the end of call centres?\n\nAsk ChatGPT whether AI will replace humans in the customer service industry, and it will offer a diplomatic answer, the summary of which is \"they will work side by side\".\n\nHumans though, are not so optimistic.\n\nLast year, the chief executive of Indian technology firm Tata Consultancy Services, K Krithivasan, told the Financial Times that AI may soon mean that there is  \"minimal need\" for call centres in Asia.\n\nMeanwhile, AI will autonomously resolve  80% of common customer service issues  by 2029, predicts business and technology research firm Gartner.\n\nThere is currently a lot of hype around \"AI agents\". That is the term given to AI systems that can operate more autonomously and make decisions.\n\nThey could turbo-charge current non-AI chatbots, known as \"rule-based chatbots\", which can only answer a set list of questions.\n\nMy own recent experience with parcel delivery firm Evri's chatbot illustrates the existing, non-AI state of play.\n\nMy parcel had not arrived, and Ezra (the name of the chatbot), offered to \"get this resolved straight away\".\n\nIt asked for a tracking reference, and after I had typed that in, it told me that my parcel had been delivered.\n\nI could request proof of delivery, and when I did so it showed me a photo of the package… at the wrong front door. And there was no option to advance the conversation after this \"evidence\" was shown.\n\nIn response, Evri tells the BBC it is investing £57m to further improve the service.\n\n\"Our intelligent chat facility uses tracking data to suggest the most helpful responses and ensure the customer's parcel is delivered as soon as possible, if this has not happened as scheduled,\" it says.\n\n\"Our data confirms the vast majority of people get the answers they need from our chat facility, first time, within seconds.  We're always reviewing feedback to ensure our services are as helpful as possible, and we continue to make enhancements on a rolling basis.\"\n\nOn the flipside, rival parcel delivery firm DPD had to disable its less rule-bound AI chatbot after it criticised the company and swore at users.\n\nGetting the balance right between being on brand and genuinely helping customers is a tricky one for businesses to grapple with as they migrate to AI.\n\nSome  85% of customer service leaders  are exploring, piloting or deploying AI chatbots, according to Gartner. But it also found that only 20% of such projects are fully meeting expectations.\n\n\"You can have a much more natural conversation with AI,\" says Garner analyst Emily Potosky.\n\n\"But the downside is the chatbot could hallucinate, it could give you out-of-date information, or tell you completely the wrong thing. For parcel delivery I would say rules-based agents are great because there are only so many permutations of questions about someone's package.\"\n\nResources and money are among the key reasons businesses may be considering the move from human to AI customer service. But Ms Potosky points out that it isn't a given that AI will be cheaper than human agents.\n\n\"This is a very expensive technology,\" she says.\n\nThe first thing that any business wanting to replace humans with AI will have to do is ensure that they have extensive training data.\n\n\"There's this idea that knowledge management becomes less important because generative AI can solve the fact that their knowledge is not particularly well organised, but actually the opposite is the case,\" adds Ms Potosky.\n\n\"Knowledge management is more important when deploying generative AI.\"\n\nJoe Inzerillo, chief digital officer at software giant Salesforce, tells the BBC that call centres provide fertile training grounds for AIs, particularly ones that have been moved to low-cost areas such as the Philippines and India.\n\nThis is because a lot of staff training will have been done, which the AI can also learn from.\n\n\"You have a huge amount of documentation, and that's all really great stuff for the AI to have when it is going to take over that first line of defence,\" he says.\n\nSalesforce's AI-powered customer service platform, AgentForce, is currently being used by a range of customers from Formula 1, to insurance firm Prudential, restaurant-booking website Open Table, and social media site Reddit.\n\nMr Inzerillo says that when Salesforce first put the platform through its paces it learned some valuable lessons about how to make the AI seem more human-like.\n\n\"While a human might say 'sorry to hear that', the agent just opened a ticket,\" says Mr Inzerillo.\n\nSo the AI was trained to show more sympathy, especially when a customer has a problem.\n\nSalesforce also found that not allowing the agent to talk about competitors proved problematic.\n\n\"This backfired when customers asked legitimate questions about integrating Microsoft Teams with Salesforce,\" says Mr Inzerillo. \"The agent refused to help because Microsoft appeared on our competitor list.\"\n\nThe firm subsequently replaced that rigid rule.\n\nSalesforce has ambitious plans for the continuing rollout of its AI agents, and so far it claims that they are a hit with its customers.

knee-deep in water for the body of one-year-old Zara. She'd been swept away by flash floods; the bodies of her parents and three siblings had already been found days earlier.\n\n\"We suddenly saw a lot of water. I climbed up to the roof and urged them to join me,\" Arshad, Zara's grandfather, said, showing the BBC the dirt road where they were taken from him in the village of Sambrial in northern Punjab in August.\n\nHis family tried to join him, but too late. The powerful current washed away all six of them.\n\nEvery year, monsoon season brings deadly floods in Pakistan.\n\nThis year it began in late June, and within three months, floods had killed more than 1,000 people. At least 6.9  million were affected, according to the United Nations  agency for humanitarian affairs, OCHA.\n\nThe South Asian nation is struggling with the devastating consequences of climate change, despite emitting just 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTo witness its effects, the BBC travelled from the mountains of the north to the plains of the south for three months. In every province, climate change was having a different impact.\n\nThere was one element in common, though. The poorest suffer most.\n\nWe met people who'd lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones – and they were resigned to going through it all again in the next monsoon.\n\nMonsoon floods started in the north, with global warming playing out in its most familiar form in Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nAmid the high peaks of the Himalayas, Karakoram and Hindu Kush, there are more than 7,000 glaciers. But due to rising temperatures, they are melting.\n\nThe result can be catastrophic: meltwater turns into glacial lakes which can suddenly burst. Thousands of villages are at risk.\n\nThis summer hundreds of homes were destroyed and roads damaged by landslides and flash floods.\n\nThese \"glacial lake outbursts\" are hard to warn against. The area is remote and mobile service poor. Pakistan and the World Bank are trying to improve an early warning system, which often doesn't work because of the mountainous terrain.\n\nCommunity is a powerful asset. When shepherd Wasit Khan woke up to rushing waters, with trailing chunks of ice and debris, he ran to an area with a better signal. He began warning as many villagers as he could.\n\n\"I told everyone to leave their belongings, leave the house, take their wives, children and elderly people and get away,\" he told BBC Urdu's Muhammad Zubair.\n\nThanks to him, dozens were saved.\n\nThe danger took a different form in the north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nIn Gadoon, the BBC found hundreds of villagers digging through piles of rocks with their bare hands.\n\nA cloudburst had caused a flash flood early in the morning, a local official said. That happens when a sudden updraft in humid, moist air leads to a heavy and localised burst of rain. The current washed away several homes and triggered a landslide.\n\nMen from neighbouring villages rushed over to help, which was invaluable – but not enough. The excavators the villagers desperately needed were trapped in flooded roads, some blocked by massive rocks.\n\n\"Nothing will happen until the machines arrive,\" one man told the BBC.\n\nThen a silence suddenly blanketed the area. Dozens of men stood still in one corner. The bodies of two children, soaked in dark mud, were pulled from under the rubble, and carried away.\n\nScenes like this played out across the province, with rescuers delayed due to uprooted trees and major infrastructure being destroyed. A helicopter carrying aid crashed in the bad weather, claiming the lives of all crew on board.\n\nIn villages and cities, millions have settled around rivers and streams, areas prone to flooding. Pakistan's River Protection Act - which prohibits building within 200 ft (61m) of a river or its tributaries - was meant to solve that issue. But for many it's simply too costly to settle elsewhere.\n\nIllegal construction makes matters worse.\n\nClimate scientist Fahad Saeed blames this on local corruption and believes officials are failing to enforce the law. He spoke to the BBC in Islamabad, next to a half-built, four-storey concrete building as big as a car park - and right by a stream that he saw flood this summer, killing a child.\n\n\"Just a few kilometres from parliament and still such things happen in Pakistan,\" he says, visibly frustrated. \"It's because of misgovernance, the role of the government is to be a watchdog.\"\n\nFormer climate minister Senator Sherry Rehman, who chairs the climate committee in Pakistan's Senate, calls it \"graft\", or simply \"looking the other way\" when permissions are given for construction in vulnerable areas.\n\nBy late August, further south in the province of Punjab, floods had submerged 4,500 villages, overwhelming \"Pakistan's breadbasket\", in a country that can't always afford to import enough food.\n\nFor the first time, three rivers - the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab - flooded simultaneously, triggering the largest rescue operation in decades.\n\n\"It was the most important anomaly,\" said Syed Muhammad Tayyab Shah, the chief risk officer for the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).\n\nIn Punjab's capital, Lahore, the impact on wealthier and poorer communities was stark. The gated community of Park View City was inundated by the Ravi river, making its prized streets impossible to navigate. Residents of luxury homes were forced to evacuate.\n\nSurveying the damage, two local men, Abdullah and his father Gulraiz, were convinced water would be drained soon, thanks to the area's property developer Aleem Khan, a federal minister.\n\n\"No problem, Aleem Khan will do it,\" Gulraiz told the BBC.\n\nBut for residents in the poorer neighbourhood of Theme Park, the floods were crushing. One officer told the BBC they kept having to rescue people who swam back to their homes when the water levels dropped, desperate to salvage whatever they could. But then the water would rise, leaving them stranded.\n\nWe saw one man returning from his house, an inflatable donut resting on his hip.\n\nSome residents were moved to tents provided by the Alkhidmat Foundation Pakistan. Sitting outside in the summer heat, Sumera was weeks away from giving birth. She was extremely thin.\n\n\"My doctor says I need two blood transfusions this week,\" she said as she tried to keep hold of her toddler, Arsh.\n\nNearby, Ali Ahmad was balancing a small kitten he rescued from the floods on his shoulder. The boy was one of the few who had a mattress to sleep on.\n\nBy the end of monsoon season, the floods had displaced more than 2.7 million people in Punjab, the UN said, and damaged more than one million hectares of farmland.\n\nFurther south in Multan district, always hit hard by floods, the scale of the humanitarian crisis became even clearer, with tents lining dirt roads and highways.\n\nAccess to healthcare was already a challenge in rural areas of Pakistan, but once the floods hit, the challenge was unbearable for many women we met.\n\nBBC Urdu's Tarhub Asghar met two sisters-in-law, both nine months pregnant. A doctor had warned them they weren't drinking enough water. They raised a bottle to explain. The water was completely brown.\n\nSome are trying different solutions.\n\nArchitect Yasmeen Lari has designed what she calls \"climate-resilient houses\" in dozens of villages. In Pono, near Hyderabad, women showed the BBC huts they'd built themselves - a large circular building on wooden stilts. Dr Lari calls it their training centre and says families can move their belongings there and shelter.\n\nBut Dr Lari argues building an entire village on stilts would be unfeasible and too expensive. Instead, she says her designs ensure the roofs don't collapse, and that by using natural materials such as bamboo and lime concrete, the homes can be rebuilt quickly by the villagers themselves.\n\nPakistan has reached a point where \"it's not about saving buildings; it's about saving lives,\" she says.\n\nThis is the reality for Pakistan. All the climate scientists and politicians the BBC spoke to warn of an increasingly worrying future.\n\n\"Every year the monsoon will become more and more aggressive,\" Syed Muhammad Tayyab Shah at the NDMA said. \"Every year, there will be a new surprise for us.\"\n\nAs the country faces the growing and ever-changing challenges posed by climate change, in which the poorest are often the worst affected, there is one refrain from people returning to homes likely to flood next year: \"I have nowhere else to go.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c803gk1vpzko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"00:02:26.113+00:00","title":"Why brushing teeth twice a day is not always best and other myths busted","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article challenges common dental myths, such as brushing twice a day or using expensive whitening pastes, emphasizing that quality and technique matter more than frequency or brand.

a scrub morning and night, a rinse with water and maybe a minty mouthwash for good measure.\n\nBut according to dental experts, even the most diligent brushers might be making a few mistakes that could be undoing their good work.\n\nDr Praveen Sharma, from the school of dentistry at the University of Birmingham, says that half of adults in the UK will have gum disease at some point and an early sign is bleeding gums.\n\n\"If your gums are bleeding or swollen it's a sign you need to brush better,\" he says.\n\nAs well as regular dentist visits, here are four things he and BBC's What's Up Docs podcast hosts Dr Xand and Dr Chris van Tulleken, say many of us are currently getting wrong which if we change could improve the health of our teeth.\n\nIt's one of the great dental commandments - brushing twice a day - and that's what  the NHS recommends .\n\nBut Dr Sharma says the real key is quality, not quantity.\n\n\"If you can find time, then yes, twice a day,\" he says. \"But it's better to do it once a day well rather than twice quickly.\"\n\nIf you are brushing once a day then he recommends it be in the evening and make sure you also floss.\n\nOf course, no one likes flossing, but Dr Sharma says using interdental brushes, particularly rubber ones, can make it easier and less painful.\n\nWhen it comes to the method, each tooth has an outer, biting and inner surface and all three need to be brushed.\n\nDr Sharma advises small circular motions over each surface without applying too much pressure. He also says to pay particular attention to the junction between the tooth and the gum as that's where gum disease can occur.\n\nDr Xand says it's important to \"focus on the sensation of the bristles\" and approach tooth brushing mindfully, not scrolling on your phone at the same time.\n\nMany people brush their teeth right after eating, but that might not be doing your enamel any favours.\n\n\"Ideally, brush before breakfast,\" Dr Sharma says. \"You don't want to do it after something acidic.\n\n\"If you do brush after, then you need to leave some space between eating and brushing.\"\n\nThat's because acids from foods and drinks, especially fruit juice or coffee, can soften tooth enamel and brushing too soon afterwards can wear it away.\n\nDr Chris suggests rinsing your mouth with water after eating to get rid of some acid and then waiting at least 30 minutes if you are brushing after breakfast.\n\nIf you've been spitting, rinsing and gargling after every brush, you might want to rethink that last step.\n\n\"You spit but don't rinse,\" Dr Sharma advises. Rinsing your mouth washes away the concentrated fluoride in the remaining toothpaste.\n\nThat means simply spitting out the excess toothpaste and leaving the thin layer of fluoride behind to continue protecting your teeth.\n\nWith shelves full of whitening, charcoal, and enamel-boosting pastes, it's easy to assume the pricier options will give you a healthier smile.\n\nBut according to Dr Sharma, it doesn't really matter which brand you choose, as long as it contains one key ingredient.\n\n\"As long as your toothpaste has fluoride, it doesn't make much difference,\" he says, adding that he tends to buy whatever is cheaper or on offer.\n\nFluoride helps protect enamel and prevents decay, and that's what really counts."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rjjdvx5r5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"03:49:34.973+00:00","title":"Zohran Mamdani - from rank outsider to possibly being New York's next mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old housing counselor and state assemblyman, is emerging as a frontrunner for New York City’s mayoral race, potentially becoming the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor and the youngest mayor in over a century.

Zohran Mamdani walked the streets of the Upper East Side for a campaign event to greet early voters, he could barely walk a few steps without being stopped by his supporters.\n\nTwo smiling young women looked starstruck and told him they followed him on Instagram. The millennial Democratic nominee for mayor thanked them before posing with another young man who had readied his phone for a selfie.\n\nThrongs of press surrounded Mamdani and captured his every moment, like running into the street to shake hands with a taxi driver shouting \"we support you, man\".\n\nWith a comfortable lead in the polls, the 34-year-old is on the brink of making history when New Yorkers vote on Tuesday, as the youngest mayor in over a century and the first Muslim and South Asian leader of the city.\n\nA relatively unknown figure just months ago, few could have predicted his rise, from hip-hop artist and housing counsellor to New York State assembleyman and frontrunner to lead the biggest city in the US, a job which comes with a $116bn (£88bn) budget and global scrutiny.\n\nThrough viral videos and outreach to content creators and podcasters, Mamdani has reached disaffected voters at a time when faith in the Democratic party among its own members is at an all-time low.\n\nBut there are questions over whether he can deliver on his ambitious promises and how a politician with no executive experience will handle the onslaught sure to come from a hostile Trump administration.\n\nThere is also the complicated relationship he has with his party establishment, as he becomes a national figurehead for left-wing Democrats.\n\nHe describes himself as a democratic socialist, which has no clear definition but essentially means giving a voice to workers, not corporations. He has promised to tax millionaires to pay for expanded social programmes. It's the politics of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with whom Mamdani has often shared a stage.\n\nTrump has threatened to withdraw federal funds if New Yorkers elect a \"communist\".\n\nMamdani has refuted that common attack line about his politics and during a daytime television interview he agreed with the host that he was \"kind of like a Scandinavian politician,\" only browner, he joked.\n\nVictory would be seen as a rejection of politics as usual by New Yorkers as they struggle with the cost of living - Mamdani's number one issue.\n\nHis main rival in Tuesday's vote is former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary.\n\nCuomo accuses Mamdani of an anti-business agenda that would kill New York. He says he has shown he can stand up to Trump but Mamdani calls Cuomo the president's puppet.\n\nCurtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, mocks both of them. In the last debate, he said: \"Zohran, your resume could fit on a cocktail napkin. And Andrew, your failures could fill a public school library in New York City.\"\n\nMamdani's message has been laser-focused on affordability and quality of life issues. He has promised universal childcare, freezing rent in subsidised units, free public buses and city-run grocery stores.\n\nIt's a message that has landed with New Yorkers fed up with sky-high prices.\n\n\"I support him because I'm a housing attorney and I see how the cost of living just keeps going up and up and up,\" Miles Ashton told the BBC outside the candidates' debate earlier this month. \"We all want an affordable city.\"\n\nThe costs of the Mamdani agenda would be covered by new taxes on corporations and millionaires, which he insists would raise $9bn - though some, like the libertarian Cato Institute,  say his sums don't add up . He would also need the support of the state legislature and Governor Kathy Hochul to implement new taxes.\n\nShe has endorsed him but says she is against increased income taxes. She does, however, want to work with him to achieve universal child care, which is by far the biggest-ticket item on his agenda at $5bn.\n\nAs he rode the M57 bus across Manhattan to highlight his free buses plan, he told the BBC why his focus on affordability was the right approach in the Trump era.\n\n\"It's time for us to understand that to defend democracy, it's not just to stand up against an authoritarian administration. It is also to ensure that that democracy can deliver on the material needs of working class people right here. That's something we've failed to do in New York City.\"\n\nAmong New Yorkers who told the BBC they were not voting for Mamdani, doubts about him being able to pay for his agenda and his inexperience were two of the biggest factors.\n\nAfter Mamdani won the Democratic primary in June, Wall Street leaders were hardly celebrating. Some threatened to leave the city.\n\nBut there's been a noticeable shift since then - the mood is less panic, more collaboration. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon even said he would offer his help if Mamdani is elected.\n\nReal estate developer Jeffrey Gural, who has met Mamdani, says he is too inexperienced to lead the nation's largest city. He thinks his rent freeze plan would hurt tenants and his taxes on wealthy people will drive high earners away.\n\nHe does, however, support Mamdani's universal childcare plan, a provision he gives his own staff at his casino upstate.\n\nPart of the change in tone since the primary has been down to a concerted effort on Mamdani's part to meet his critics.\n\nOn 14 October, Alexis Bittar, a self-taught jewellery designer who grew his business into a global company, hosted Mamdani and 40 business leaders at his 1850s Brooklyn townhouse.\n\nThey were a mix of CEOs and business owners from financial, fashion and art sectors. More than half were Jewish and they were all either on the fence or opposed to Mamdani's candidacy.\n\nThere were questions about business, his management experience and how he would finance his agenda.\n\n\"I think he came across great,\" Mr Bittar told the BBC. \"The thing that's remarkable about him is he's incredibly equipped to answer them - and diligently answer them.\"\n\nPart of Mamdani's engagement with his critics has been a willingness to change his position.\n\nIn 2020, after the murder of black man George Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota, Mamdani called for the city to defund police and called the NYPD \"racist\". But he has since apologised and says he no longer holds those views.\n\nCrime is the number one issue for Howard Wolfson, who worked for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and is now a Democratic strategist. He was present during a meeting last month between the mayoral hopeful and Bloomberg, who spent $8m during the primary race trying to beat him.\n\nWolfson told the BBC he will judge Mamdani on how the city is policed.\n\n\"I think it's great that he reaches out and is engaged, but I'm much more interested in how he's going to govern,\" he said. \"Public safety is really the prerequisite for success or failure.\"\n\nMany see Mamdani's pledge to ask the police commissioner Jessica Tisch to stay on as a way to allay concerns he would be soft on crime.\n\nHe says he would maintain the current level of NYPD staffing and create a new department of community safety that would deploy mental health care teams instead of armed officers to non-threatening, psychiatric calls.\n\nOne position Mamdani has stood firm on is his criticism of Israel and lifelong support for Palestinian rights.\n\nIt represents a break from the Democratic party establishment and could be a deciding factor for many voters in a city with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel.\n\nHe sparked outrage during the primary process when he refused to condemn the term \"globalise the intifada\". But after Jewish New Yorkers expressed their unease to him, telling him they felt unsafe on hearing it, he said he discouraged others from using it.\n\nA letter signed by more than 1,100 rabbis cited Mamdani as it condemned the \"political normalisation\" of anti-Zionism. Jewish voters are largely split between Mamdani and Cuomo in polling.\n\nBrad Lander, the city's comptroller, or financial chief, who teamed up with Mamdani in the Democratic primary to endorse each other's candidacy against Cuomo, says many Jewish New Yorkers like him are very enthusiastic about Mamdani.\n\nHe is a mayoral candidate deeply committed to keeping everyone safe, regardless of religious beliefs, Lander told the BBC.\n\nSumaiya Chowdhury and Farhana Islam of the group Muslims for Progress have canvassed for the mayoral hopeful.\n\nMs Islam said that, while they are all excited that he could be New York's first Muslim mayor, he doesn't need to lean on his identity for support.\n\n\"His policies speak for themselves and they alone are enough to make him popular.\"\n\nSince his primary win, the Islamophobia Mamdani faces has increased. He now has police security and, last month, a Texas man was arrested on charges of making terroristic threats against him. In one message, the man said \"Muslims don't belong here\".\n\nMamdani decided to deliver an address on Islamophobia after Cuomo laughed along to a radio talkshow host saying that Mamdani would cheer another 9/11-style attack.\n\nIn an emotional speech, he said he had hoped that by ignoring racist attacks and sticking to a central message, it would allow him to be more than just his faith. \"I was wrong. No amount of redirection is ever enough.\"\n\nWhat may propel Mamdani to victory in liberal New York may not be a recipe for success nationally. And Democrats in Congress seem worried about the implications of his ascendancy as party tensions between moderates and progressives persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has not endorsed Mamdani, while his fellow New Yorker House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries only endorsed him a few hours before early voting began.\n\nDemocratic strategists have said the problem posed by Mamdani for the party's establishment is that Trump and the Republicans already cast Democrats, no matter how moderate, as socialists. And it's a tactic that is thought to have landed with some effect among Cuban and Venezuelan voters in the 2024 election.\n\nJosh Gottheimer, the moderate Democratic representative of New Jersey,  told the Washington Post  he thought Mamdani had \"extremist views\" at odds with the Democratic party and that he feared Republicans will use the candidate as a kind of \"bogeyman\".\n\nAt a campaign event on the Upper East Side, Mamdani told the BBC how he plans to handle the intense scrutiny if he wins, pointing to the energy behind his candidacy.\n\n\"There is no doubt that there will be opposition as we see that opposition today, and what has allowed us to surmount the unbelievable amounts of money that has been spent against this campaign in the primary or the general, has been the mass movement that we have created.\"\n\nPaloma Nadera, 38, volunteering at the event, said the last time she had been this excited to vote had been for Barack Obama in 2008. Since then she's been disappointed by what she called the lack of bravery within the party.\n\n\"I feel like this race means so much to me because it's local. It's going to affect me, my family, my friends, everyone here in New York City.\n\n\"But it's also sort of sending a message, up the chain about what we want politics to start to look like on the Democratic side on a national level.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Grace Goodwin"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxng7kxnp9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:34:19.886+00:00","title":"Nato 'will stand with Ukraine' to get long-lasting peace, senior official tells BBC","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NATO, under the leadership of Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, reaffirms its unwavering commitment to supporting Ukraine until a lasting peace is achieved.

BBC\n\nNato \"will stand with Ukraine up to the day in which we will have them sitting around the table for a long-lasting peace\", a senior official from the military alliance has told the BBC.\n\nAdmiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, chair of Nato's military committee since January, added from an operational point of view he considered the Russia-Ukraine war was bogged down, and \"it was almost time to sit and talk because it's a waste of lives\".\n\nPointing to the fact that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had resulted in two more countries joining the Western alliance - Finland and Sweden - Adm Dragone described the war as a strategic failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite recent slow, incremental advances by Russia on the battlefield.\n\n\"They will not get a friendly or puppet government like in Belarus. Putin will not succeed.\"\n\nAsked if European nations were prepared to keep going with supporting Ukraine's defence, he said they were. It was beneficial, he believed that they had had something of a wake-up call and were now taking charge of their own defence.\n\nIn June, Nato members  agreed to raise their defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 . The move followed repeated urges from US President Donald Trump for members to do so.\n\nOn Russia's  recent announcement about long-range, nuclear-powered weapons  like the Burevestnik and the Poseidon, the former Italian chief of defence staff and naval aviator played down concerns by Nato, saying that it was a defensive nuclear alliance.\n\n\"We are not threatened by them,\" he said, \"we are just ready to defend our 32 nations and our one billion people. We are a nuclear alliance.\"\n\nOn the risk of future invasions or attacks, Adm Dragone said if - and he emphasised the conditional here - there was to be anywhere it would likely be the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBut he pointed out that as Nato states Article 5 would be requested - which considers an attack on one nation to be equivalent to an attack on all - and that Nato would come to their defence.\n\nAsked if that included the US, he replied: \"Yes, because they have committed to this and they have underlined that they are still in the business.\"\n\nOf all Nato defence needs right now, Adm Dragone said air defence was the top priority. Recent incursions by Russian drones into Poland and Romania have prompted the alliance to upgrade its air defences.\n\nRegarding the possibility of activating a notional \"drone wall\" on Nato's eastern borders, he said this would be done within months and that \"the alliance's Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk [Virginia] is already working on that\".\n\n\"There is a lot of stuff on the market which will fulfil our immediate needs so we set up a new activity which is Eastern Sentry... integrating all the air defence that we already have on our eastern flank.\n\n\"Airspace incursions are pretty frequent, we escort them out and that's basically the game,\" the admiral said.\n\nDespite no sign that Russia is changing course on the war in Ukraine and despite signs that some members - notably Slovakia and Hungary - are increasingly opposed to supporting Ukraine's defence, Adm Dragone ended on a positive note.\n\n\"The alliance is reliable, it is mature, there is a cohesion which is our centre of gravity.\"\n\n\"The alliance is stronger than our adversaries, and we will stay with Ukraine up to the day that peace will break out,\" he added."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnve21y7lreo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"21:41:04.794+00:00","title":"Netherlands to return stolen ancient sculpture to Egypt","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Netherlands has pledged to return a 3,500-year-old stone head sculpture, believed to have been stolen during the Arab Spring in 2011 or 2012, to Egypt.

Egypt\n\nThe Netherlands has said it will return a stolen 3,500-year-old sculpture to Egypt.\n\nIt is \"highly likely\" the stone head, dating from the time of the pharaohs, was plundered during the Arab Spring in either 2011 or 2012, according to the Dutch  Information & Heritage Inspectorate.\n\nA decade later, it turned up at an arts and antiques fair in Maastricht and, following an anonymous tip-off, Dutch authorities determined it had been stolen and exported illegally.\n\nDutch outgoing prime minister Dick Schoof made the pledge to hand it back as he attended the opening of the archaeological  Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza  this weekend.\n\nThe Dutch government said the sculpture of a high-ranking official from the dynasty of Pharaoh Thutmose III is \"deeply meaningful to Egypt's identity\".\n\nThe statue had been offered up for sale at The European Fine Art Foundation fair in 2022. The dealer voluntarily relinquished the sculpture after authorities had been tipped off about its illegal origin.\n\nThe government said it expected to hand the stone head over to the Egyptian ambassador to the Netherlands at the end of this year.\n\n\"The Netherlands is committed both nationally and internationally to ensuring the return of heritage to its original owners,\" it said.\n\nThe news comes as Egypt celebrated the opening of the enormous Grand Egyptian Museum showcasing its archaeological heritage this weekend.\n\nFirst proposed in 1992, the construction of the museum itself was interrupted by the Arab Spring.\n\nCosting around $1.2bn (£910m), the facility contains 100,000 artefacts, including the entire contents of the intact tomb of the boy king Tutankhamun and his famous gold mask.\n\nProminent Egyptologists are hoping the museum will strengthen demands for key antiquities held in other countries to be returned.\n\nThese include the Rosetta Stone, the key to deciphering hieroglyphics, which is on display at the British Museum in London."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm277455158o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"17:04:23.155+00:00","title":"Staff shortages from government shutdown cause delays at US airports","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal government shutdown has caused widespread delays and flight cancellations at US airports due to a shortage of air traffic controllers who are working without pay.

intimidation directed at a UK university to get it to shut down sensitive research into alleged human rights abuses, documents seen by the BBC show.\n\nSheffield Hallam University staff in China were threatened by individuals described by them as being from China's National Security Service who demanded the research being  done in Sheffield be halted.\n\nAnd access to the university's websites from China was blocked, impeding its ability to recruit Chinese students, in a campaign of threats and intimidation lasting more than two years.\n\nIn an internal email from July 2024, university officials said \"attempting to retain the business in China and publication of the research are now untenable bedfellows\".\n\nWhen the UK government learned of the case, the then Foreign Secretary David Lammy issued a warning to his Chinese counterpart that it would not tolerate attempts to suppress academic freedoms at UK universities, the BBC understands.\n\nThe issue was also raised with China's most senior education minister.\n\nChina was seeking to halt research by Laura Murphy, professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam, into allegations Uyghur Muslims in the north-western region of Xinjiang were subject to forced labour.\n\nChina  has faced accusations  – always firmly denied – that it has committed crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population.\n\nIn late 2024, following pressure from the Chinese state and a separate defamation law suit against the university, Sheffield Hallam decided not to publish a final piece of research by Prof Murphy and her team into forced labour.\n\nAnd in early 2025, university administrators told her that she could \"not continue with her research into supply chains and forced labour in China\".\n\nShe initiated legal action against the university for failing in its duty to protect her academic freedom and she submitted a \"subject access request\" demanding Sheffield Hallam hand over any relevant internal documents.\n\nThe documents she obtained showed the university \"had negotiated directly with a foreign intelligence service to trade my academic freedom for access to the Chinese student market,\" she told the BBC.\n\nShe added: \"I'd never seen anything quite so patently explicit about the extent to which a university would go to ensure that they have Chinese student income.\"\n\nSheffield Hallam has now apologised to Prof Murphy and said she can resume her work.\n\nA spokesperson said \"the university's decision to not continue with Professor Laura Murphy's research was taken based on our understanding of a complex set of circumstances at the time, including being unable to secure the necessary professional indemnity insurance\".\n\nThey said the university wished to \"make clear our commitment to supporting her research and to securing and promoting freedom of speech and academic freedom within the law\".\n\nBut the general secretary of the University and College Union, Jo Grady, said \"it is incredibly worrying that Sheffield Hallam appears to have attempted to silence its own professor on behalf of a foreign government\".\n\nShe added: \"Given the censorship Hallam has seemingly engaged in, it now needs to set out how it will ensure its academics will be supported to research freely and protected from overreach by foreign powers.\"\n\nA government spokesperson told the BBC \"any attempt by a foreign state to intimidate, harass or harm individuals in the UK will not be tolerated, and the government has made this clear to Beijing after learning of this case\".\n\nIt all began so differently.\n\nWhen, in 2021, Prof Murphy published  a major report into Uhygur forced labour in the solar panel industry , the director of the Helena Kennedy Centre (HKC), the department in which her unit was based, wrote to congratulate her.\n\n\"This is an exceptional moment in the history of the HKC... we are all exceptionally proud of this body of work which rightly shines light on the blatant abuse of Uyghur tights (sic) in China.. Well done Laura!\"\n\nOver the following months her unit published four reports, including into car parts and cotton for clothing, trying to trace supply chains and highlight where goods reaching western consumers may have been produced with inputs made with forced labour in Xinjiang.\n\nChina denies such practices occur.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in London told the BBC \"the Helena Kennedy Centre at the Sheffield Hallam University has released multiple fake reports on Xinjiang that are seriously flawed\".\n\n\"It has been revealed that some authors of these reports received funding from certain US agencies,\" the Embassy added.\n\nProf Murphy told the BBC she has received funding over the course of her career from the US National Endowment for Humanities for work on slave narratives, the US Department of Justice for work on human trafficking in New Orleans, and more recently from USAID, the US State Department and the UK Foreign Office for her work on China.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy said the allegations of \"forced labor\" in her reports \"cannot withstand basic fact-check\".\n\n\"While presenting itself as an academic body, the Centre has in practice acted as a vehicle for politicised and disinformation-driven narratives deployed by anti-China forces,\" the embassy added.\n\nThe university realised it was coming in for criticism from China as far back as 2022.\n\nAn internal university email from August of that year, seen by the BBC, said China's foreign ministry had issued a statement \"denouncing us as being in the 'disreputable vanguard of anti-China rhetoric'\".\n\nThe email said the university had admitted 500 Chinese students in 2018, but numbers had collapsed in the pandemic and had not bounced back like it had in other markets.\n\nIt expressed concern that the Chinese government's criticisms could result in a \"boycott\" by prospective students and recruitment agents.\n\nIn total, the documents show Sheffield had earned £3.8m in 2021/22 from China and Hong Kong.\n\nLater in August 2022 the university's English language testing website used by Chinese students to take tests before coming to Sheffield had been \"shut down in China temporarily\".\n\nOver the next two years the pressure escalated dramatically leading university officials to write in an email in May 2024 that \"the continuation of the university's scholarly activity with and in China and Hong Kong has been placed at risk because of the research activities, led by Professor Laura Murphy, in relation to alleged persecution of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, China\".\n\nAn internal \"risk summary,\" dated 9 December 2024, detailed what had happened.\n\nIn August 2022, China had blocked access to the university's websites. All email communication from and to the university was disabled.\n\nIt meant students in China due to study at Sheffield Hallam were unable to access the enrolment website, arrange their welcome or airport pick up in the UK, or course information.\n\nThe university said this had \"undoubtedly had a negative impact on recruitment\" in 23/24, with \"anticipated further decline in 24/25\".\n\nAnd, in 2024, the intimidation began.\n\n\"Things in Beijing have kicked off,\" an internal email from 18 April 2024 said.\n\nThe risk summary detailed that \"three officers of the National Security Service\" visited Sheffield Hallam's office in China.\n\nA local staff member was \"questioned for two hours regarding the HKC research and future publications.\n\n\"The tone was threatening and message to cease the research activity was made clear.\"\n\nAt another visit, security officers said the internet issues were because the Uyghur research was available on the university website.\n\nFinally, in September 2024, the document states \"a decision by the university not to publish a final phase of the research on forced labour in China was communicated to the National Security Service .. immediately relations improved and the threat to staff wellbeing appears to be removed\".\n\nSheffield Hallam says these internal communications need to be seen in context and do not represent university policy.\n\nComplicating things for Sheffield Hallam had been a report by its Forced Labour Lab published December 2023 into clothing supply chains connected to Xinjiang.\n\nSmart Shirts Ltd, a Hong Kong supplier of garments with customers in the UK, brought a claim for libel, alleging it had been defamed as its name was included.\n\nA preliminary ruling at the High Court in London in December 2024 found that report had been \"defamatory\".\n\nA full trial in that case is yet to take place at which Sheffield Hallam will be able to put forward its defence to the company's claim, but the university was told by its insurers that \"any defamation, libel or slander\" claims linked to its entire Social and Economic Research Institute were no longer covered.\n\nProfessor Murphy had, meanwhile, built an international profile.\n\nHer work had been cited in the UK parliament, in Canada and in Australia. She had taken a career break in late 2023 to work for the US Department of Homeland Security, helping it with the implementation of their Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act.\n\nIn her absence, and amid the pressure from China and the lawsuit, Sheffield Hallam decided her unit would close in early 2025.\n\n\"Despite significant offers of continued funding we have decided it is in our best interests to terminate the research,\" an email of August 2024 said.\n\nIt added that by not publishing the final report under the university's auspices it hoped \"we can minimise the possibility of any further scrutiny of our operations .. thereby attending to related duty of care issues\".\n\nBut failing to publish the report was a breach of the terms agreed with the external groups who had agreed to fund the research.\n\nSo the university decided to close the unit and not use any outstanding funds.\n\nSheffield Hallam said it was normal practice for research groups to stand down at the end of an external contract.\n\nWhen Prof Murphy returned from her career break in early 2025, the university told her of its \"decision not to continue with her research into supply chains and forced labour in China due to .. the corporate insurance position .. and our duty of care to colleagues working in both China and the UK\".\n\nAny other work or public engagements outside the university would also have to be checked for \"conflict of interest\".\n\nSeeking to continue her work, Prof Murphy began her legal action and made a subject access request to the university requiring it to turn over relevant internal documents.\n\n\"What about the duty of care to me and the duty of care to the rest of my research team?,\" Prof Murphy told the BBC.\n\n\"They laid off my entire research team. Sent them away. They sent back all of our research funding, and they shuttered the entire programme without regard for the people who worked with us on that project, so many of them Uyghur folks.\"\n\nShe added: \"As long as the university system in the UK is so wildly underfunded as it is now, universities will be vulnerable to attacks like this.\"\n\nAfter receiving her apology from the university and a pledge to protect her academic freedom, she is not currently pursuing her legal action.\n\nHer case had been built on the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023, which places on universities a duty to promote freedom of speech and academic freedom for their staff.\n\nHer solicitors, Leigh Day, had argued that a lack of insurance  and \"unspecified\" concerns about staff safety do not provide universities carte blanche to restrict freedoms.\n\nThe law firm believes refusing to authorise any research on a particular country would be unlawful.\n\nSheffield Hallam's spokesperson said: \"For the avoidance of doubt, the decision was not based on commercial interests in China.\n\n\"Regardless, China is not a significant international student market for the university.\"\n\nThe university only enrolled 73 students from China in 2024/25.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy said \"there are over 200,000 Chinese students in the UK, making China the largest source of international students in the UK,\"  adding \"educational cooperation has become a driving force in bilateral ties\".\n\nBaroness Helena Kennedy KC, patron of the centre that bears her name, said UK universities were \"vulnerable\" to pressure from China because \"bringing in Chinese students is one of the ways of dealing with the financial crises that universities are facing\".\n\n\"If we see limitations being made on the kind of research that goes on in these universities, I think we should be alarmed,\" added the Labour peer, who has herself been sanctioned by China for speaking out about issues related to Xinjiang.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter  to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kp19ed78wo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"08:20:00.918+00:00","title":"I blew the whistle on a massive tax fraud - and they sued me","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jas Bains, a former head lawyer at the London-based hedge fund Solo Capital, exposed a massive tax fraud scheme involving the 'cum-ex' trade that targeted Denmark.

2025-11-02T08:20:00.918+00:00\n\nTitle: I blew the whistle on a massive tax fraud - and they sued me\n\n\"We'd be met at airports in 20-foot limousines, and taken to places like the Atlantis hotel in Dubai or the Singapore Grand Prix. There'd be a hundred grand spent in the bar.\"\n\nIn 2013, Jas Bains was an ambitious young lawyer, enjoying the high life that came with working for an extremely profitable City hedge fund.\n\nToday, he is jobless and has lost most of his wealth, having spent years fighting legal battles and attempting to clear his name of association with a huge tax scam.\n\nThe irony, he says, is that he blew the whistle on the scam in the first place – only to find himself one of the targets of a £1.4bn lawsuit.\n\nHe is reflecting one month after  the case ended,  bringing to a close eight years of legal arguments and one of the highest value civil cases ever heard in the UK.\n\nThe Danish tax authority was left licking its wounds, after failing to establish that a large group of defendants, including Mr Bains, were liable for huge losses it had suffered.\n\nIt all began in 2009, when a banker named Sanjay Shah established a London-based hedge fund called Solo Capital. It also had offices in Dubai. It was one of a network of funds, banks and legal outfits that were to become heavily implicated in  the so-called cum-ex trade.\n\nThis focused on transactions where shares were sold from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend (cum, or with, dividend) but delivered afterwards (ex-dividend).\n\nThose involved exploited delays in processing the sale to create confusion over who actually owned the shares at the moment when the dividend was paid. This tactic allowed both parties to claim rebates on withholding tax - a levy which had only been paid once, when the dividend was issued.\n\nFrom the outside, it was complicated, but for those involved it led to ever bigger and more elaborate trades which ultimately cost taxpayers across Europe billions.\n\nIt initially became popular in Germany, before spreading to other countries including France, Belgium, Italy and Austria. Solo Capital targeted Denmark, with the bulk of its cum-ex trades taking place from 2013 onwards.\n\nJas Bains joined the company in 2010, as its head lawyer, but went on to run the London office. At the time, Solo was \"a successful firm, making money in five or six different areas pretty well\".\n\nAnd making money meant enjoying the high life, with staff going on sprees to places like Las Vegas, Singapore and Dubai.\n\n\"What I will say about Sanjay is he knew how to throw a party,\" he says.\n\n\"One time we were in the Ku De Ta club at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore. He bought 20 bottles of vintage Dom Perignon champagne, and people were just spraying each other with the stuff.\n\n\"People have likened it to Wolf of Wall Street and such like.\"\n\nIt didn't end there. \"Sanjay organised private concerts in Dubai with Prince. A small room with him and his friends at three or four million dollars for an evening ... private concerts with Snoop Dogg.\"\n\nBy mid-2014, however, Mr Bains had fallen out with his boss and left the company for a competitor. At the time, the cum-ex transactions targeting Denmark were dramatically picking up.\n\n\"I was hearing from people who'd left Solo that Sanjay was doing some big trades in 2014, but look, I'd moved on, it didn't have much to do with me,\" he says.\n\n\"But then I heard, actually Sanjay made close to €100m in trades from Denmark in 2013, closer to €250m in 2014 and he was looking for a billion in 2015.\"\n\nAlarm bells were ringing.\n\n\"I thought this can't be right. It's not that I thought the trades were invalid or criminal in some way. It's just any country that has a billion Euros syphoned off it will scream bloody murder.\"\n\nSolo Capital wasn't the only company now targeting Denmark. Others were getting in on the act. Jas believed it was only a matter of time before the house of cards came tumbling down.\n\n\"I was quite confident I'd done nothing wrong, but I knew if this carried on and blew up in spectacular style, I was going to get pulled in,\" he explains.\n\nWith that in mind, in 2015, he decided to blow the whistle.\n\nHe contacted a Danish lawyer, who in turn put him in touch with the Danish police. He went on to spend two and a half years assisting them with understanding how the cum-ex scam worked.\n\nDanish prosecutors did not target Mr Bains. Their attention was focused firmly on Mr Shah. The 54-year-old was eventually extradited from Dubai to face fraud charges – and in December last year was  sentenced to 12 years in jail .\n\nIt was the heaviest penalty ever handed out in Denmark for a fraud case. He is currently appealing.\n\nBut when the Danish tax authority, Skatteforvaltningen (Skat), launched its huge case, seeking to recover its lost money, Mr Bains was one of the more than 100 individual and corporate defendants initially targeted - alongside Mr Shah.\n\nWith that lawsuit hanging over him it became out of the question for him to work as a lawyer, or to get a role in the City of London.\n\n\"It's impossible to get a job if you're being sued as part of a two billion dollar international tax fraud case,\" he says.\n\nHowever, in October, High court judge Mr Justice Andrew Baker threw out Skat's claims.\n\nAcknowledging that \"greed can be a powerful motive, and I consider there was substantial greed here\", he nevertheless concluded that Skat has failed to prove it was a victim of deception.\n\nThe authority's \"controls for assessing and paying dividend tax refund claims were so flimsy as to be non-existent,\" he said.\n\nThat seemed to echo a statement previously made by Mr Shah in a 2021 German TV interview, which was also cited in the ruling:\n\n\"Why would they pay out for years and years and then, after four years of payments they say, 'Oh, we made a mistake, or we were cheated'\", he said.\n\n\"If there's a big sign on the street saying 'please help yourself', then me or somebody else would go and help themselves.\"\n\nThere may still be an appeal. But for Mr Bains, the ruling provided some much-needed closure – and, he says, a chance to move on."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3x4w1g5v3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"17:29:28.340+00:00","title":"Avalanche in Italy kills five including father and daughter","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains, specifically on Cima Vertana in the Ortler Alps, killed five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father.

Listening’: An Undecided Republican Lawmaker Weighs New Voting Maps\n\nPublished: 2025-11-02T14:01:01-05:00\n\nFor two hours on Saturday, Greg Goode, a Republican member of the Indiana Senate, sat on a tall wooden chair, listening as constituents told him they oppose a plan to redraw the state’s political map to send more Republicans to Congress.\n\nNo one spoke in favor of the idea. Mr. Goode said later that six of the roughly 200 people who showed up for the event, which he arranged, indicated support for the redistricting plan on a sign-up sheet.\n\nAs Republicans and Democrats across the country race to draw new maps outside the usual once-a-decade cycle, often with little intraparty debate or discussion with opponents, Saturday’s exchange stood out as a counterpoint. Here was a Republican lawmaker saying he was unsure how he would vote on a map sought by President Trump, and seeking feedback from a left-leaning crowd that spoke against drawing new maps and described broader fears about the country’s direction.\n\n“A fascist government has decided that they’re going to tell all the way down to the smallest district who’s boss,” said Thomas Baer, 68, a Terre Haute resident who urged Mr. Goode to “say no to this blatant power grab.”\n\nSeveral states have moved quickly to draw new maps, with only nominal resistance from members of the party in power. But passage of a new map advantageous to Republicans is not a certainty in Indiana, where the president and his allies have struggled for months to muster enough support. Legislators like Mr. Goode will decide what happens.\n\nMore than 60 people, some of whom waited in the November chill to be let inside, spoke to Mr. Goode on Saturday in Terre Haute’s dimly lit City Council chambers. The senator, who was seated about 10 feet away, nodded and thanked them for coming. The conversation remained calm, respectful and even earnest at times.\n\n“Changing the rules in the middle of the game is not what Hoosiers do,” a man told Mr. Goode. “It’s about ethics, representation and democracy itself,” one woman said. Another woman said that “this is nothing more than stealing,” and asked whether the senator’s listening session was “just for show today, or is this for substance?”\n\nRedistricting typically happens at the beginning of each decade, based on new census data. But ever since Texas Republicans, acting at Mr. Trump’s behest, passed a new congressional map this summer that positioned them to flip five Democratic-held seats in next year’s midterm elections, leaders of both parties have scrambled to wring out more seats in states where they control the legislature.\n\nOn the Republican side, Missouri and North Carolina have passed new maps. On the Democratic side, Virginia and California have taken steps toward creating new boundaries, with California voters set to decide Tuesday on a proposal that would position Democrats to flip five seats next year.\n\nMore states could follow.\n\nIn Indiana, which Mr. Trump carried by 19 percentage points last year, Republicans now hold seven of the nine congressional seats and the party has large majorities in the state legislature. But some Republican state lawmakers have publicly balked at redrawing the lines to create a congressional map that would favor Republicans 8-1 or 9-0.\n\nThe debate grew more urgent last week when Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, called a special legislative session to consider a new map. Within minutes of that announcement, a spokeswoman for a top Republican in the State Senate said “the votes still aren’t there for redistricting,” leaving open the possibility that lawmakers could return to the Capitol but fail to pass a new map. That special session was scheduled to start on Monday, but lawmakers have indicated that they are likely to wait.\n\nMany Indiana Republicans, including members of the U.S. House delegation, have fallen in line behind redistricting, especially as more Democratic-led states have joined the push. When he called the special session, Mr. Braun framed it as a way to “protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington.”\n\nAn exact vote breakdown in the Indiana Senate remains unclear, but Mr. Goode’s eventual decision could be critical.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Goode said he had not yet seen a proposed map and that he did not plan to take a public stance on redistricting until it was time for him to vote. He said it had been “overwhelming that folks here, so far, are not for it,” and that he would continue to seek input.\n\n“We’re still less than a week from when the governor called the special session,” Mr. Goode told reporters. “That’s why you take everything and you process it, but you’ve got to keep listening.”\n\nMr. Goode has criticized some of the discourse around remapping. Last month, he posted on Facebook about “those trying to bully me on redistricting.” He included a photo of Robert F. Kennedy, the Democratic senator who was assassinated in the 1960s, with his post, writing, “I pray to our Lord and Savior for wisdom and reflect on political heroes who stood up for the greater good above the politics of the day.”\n\nOn Saturday morning, Mr. Goode placed a copy of Norman Rockwell’s “Freedom of Speech” painting on the sign-in table and thanked the mayor of Terre Haute, a Democrat, for opening City Hall for the event on short notice. Mr. Goode talked about Mr. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his opening remarks.\n\n“I’m a big believer in looking to the past, and challenging times our country has faced, and kind of trying to rise to the occasion,” Mr. Goode told the crowd.\n\nThe president and his allies have lobbied aggressively for Indiana to pass new boundaries as part of the effort to maintain or expand Republicans’ narrow House majority. Mr. Goode said he was part of a group that met with Vice President JD Vance in Indianapolis, and that he had also visited Washington and been on a conference call with Mr. Trump. Mr. Goode said he was “very grateful for the case that they made.” He said he did not feel that the White House had pressured him.\n\nMr. Goode, who joined the Indiana Senate in 2023 after local Republican Party members selected him to fill a vacant seat, represents an area about 75 miles southwest of Indianapolis that used to be more politically mixed but is now solidly conservative. The largest city in the district, Terre Haute, population 58,000, is home to Indiana State University and a federal prison.\n\nRepublican state legislators in Indiana have been inundated by emails from conservative groups, and some activists have threatened to mount primary challenges against lawmakers who do not fall in line. Mr. Goode is up for election next year. The Democrats fielded no candidate in his district in the last cycle.\n\nVigo County, where Terre Haute is situated, was long seen as a bellwether in presidential elections, having voted for every winner from 1956 through 2016. It has since become solidly Republican, voting for Mr. Trump by 18 percentage points last year.\n\nIn interviews, residents said they believed that their state was more politically diverse than the numbers suggested. Several expressed optimism that showing up to share their views with Mr. Goode on Saturday might have an effect.\n\n“Participation is important,” said William Carper, 76, who describes himself as a political independent and said he opposes drawing a new map. “If you don’t speak,” he added, “people will not hear your voice.”\n\nAs the event on Saturday wrapped up, Mr. Goode said he was “going to continue to keep this open mind” and encouraged residents to stay in touch with him. Later that day, he said in a text message that he was “grateful that so many took time to respectfully voice their opinions.”\n\n“I was moved,” he added.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/nyregion/nyc-marathon-mens-race-close-finish.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"18:33:06-05:00","title":"Close Finish in N.Y.C.

He estimated that President Trump’s decision to lower tariffs on Chinese products would save him roughly $30,000 in tariff costs on a shipment the company has coming in from China this week — enough to perhaps hire another seasonal employee in the small Washington town where Cocoon is based.\n\nBut the tariff deal came with a downside. Cocoon had begun shifting some production to India this spring to avoid high tariffs on China. But in the past few months, Mr. Trump has raised tariffs on India by 50 percent, while dropping tariffs on Cocoon’s Chinese goods to 30 percent, scrambling the company’s plans.\n\nMr. McMaster lamented the time he had spent on building up production in India. At least for the time being, he said, “I’m not going to spend any more energy trying to get out of China.”\n\nAfter a chaotic year of tariff threats and trade deals, the United States has landed, at least temporarily, in a surprising situation. In the face of a potentially devastating trade clash with China, Mr. Trump agreed to cut in half a 20 percent tariff he had used to punish China for its role in the flow of fentanyl.\n\nThat has pared back U.S. tariffs on certain Chinese products to levels that are nominally near or sometimes below those he has put on products from other countries, including some allies like Switzerland, India, Brazil and Canada. According to calculations by the Yale Budget Lab, the average effective tariff on Chinese goods has risen by 20.2 percentage points this year, compared with 17.3 percentage points for the rest of the world.\n\nNot every company pays the same tariff, and other calculations that include earlier tariffs on China indicate a higher overall rate. Chad P. Bown, an economist at the Peterson Institute, has calculated an average tariff rate for China of 47.6 percent, but it is not clear how that compares with U.S. tariffs on other countries.\n\nCompanies that rely on doing business with China have been grateful for the tariff reduction, even as they scramble to parse what the latest deal means to them and how long it will last. Some economists and executives argue that the outcome may slow the move by companies to find alternatives to China, potentially complicating a longer-run effort by U.S. officials to reduce America’s dependence on Chinese supply chains.\n\nMany companies remain intent on diversifying where they source their products and are cautious about tying their fortunes to China over the longer term. Yet the current system of tariffs removes some of the urgency for companies to find factories outside China. It also chips away at the economic advantage that companies had expected from moving factories to Brazil, Vietnam and India.\n\n“There isn’t a great incentive, if this is the final tariff structure, to reallocate out of China,” said Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. He argued that the tariff differential between China and other countries was much smaller now than Mr. Trump had suggested in his 2024 campaign, when he proposed putting a 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods and a 10 to 20 percent tariff on products from the rest of the world.\n\n“Contrary to what many in the administration are saying, they haven’t ended up with a tariff structure that really encourages relocation out of China,” Mr. Setser said.\n\nThe Trump administration disputed that idea, saying that its national security tariffs — which impose taxes on products like auto parts, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors — would disproportionately affect China. Officials also argued that the administration was focused on ending China’s chokehold on other products, like rare earths.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that Mr. Trump had pledged to end “America’s foreign reliance by reviving domestic manufacturing and industry.” The trade deals and trillions of dollars in investment commitments “prove that the Trump administration’s trade and tariff policies are delivering on this pledge,” he said.\n\nChina’s ability to retaliate appears to be one reason that the country is not facing more severe tariffs, as India and Brazil are. Mr. Trump has threatened repeatedly to put triple-digit tariffs on China, but Beijing responded by hitting back at the United States where it hurt. It created a system to regulate the export of rare earth minerals and clamped down on those shipments, threatening to shutter U.S. auto plants and other factories.\n\nThe strategy worked. Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, walked out of negotiations with lower fentanyl-related tariffs than countries like Canada, which have tried to placate Mr. Trump.\n\nAfter a meeting in South Korea last week, Mr. Trump agreed to pause new fees on Chinese ships and delay sanctions on thousands of Chinese companies, in addition to cutting a 10 percent tariff. China said it would suspend the rollout of certain rare earths restrictions for a year and return to buying U.S. soybeans. It also said it would crack down on shipments of the chemicals used to make fentanyl.\n\nSean Stein, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said companies viewed the agreement as “a very strong step forward, giving some certainty and some predictability to to what’s happening in the U.S.-China relationship.” He agreed, however, that the deal might lessen the incentive for companies to find alternatives to China.\n\nHe said many companies have found that “in no place has it been possible to replicate the manufacturing ecosystem and cost efficiencies that you get in China.\" The instability and unpredictability of where tariffs might land in other markets had made companies “doubly hesitant about expanding supply chain networks outside of China,” he added.\n\n“At the beginning of the Trump administration, there was a very clear sense that there was going to be a lot of pressure for companies to move supply chains out of China,” Mr. Stein said. “But at this point, that pressure hasn’t materialized.”\n\nIn the wake of last week’s agreement, Mr. Trump will have added a 20 percent tariff to all Chinese imports so far this year. That includes the 10 percent fentanyl tariff and another 10 percent tariff that Mr. Trump said is directed at slowing the flow of Chinese imports into the United States.\n\nA portion of Chinese imports also face an additional tariff of 7.5 to 25 percent left over from Mr. Trump’s first-term trade war. Chinese products are also hit by Mr. Trump’s global tariffs on industries like autos, steel and aluminum, as well as pre-existing tariffs from the World Trade Organization, and Chinese goods qualify for fewer tariff exclusions than many other countries’.\n\nAlthough U.S. tariffs on Chinese products are high, American tariffs on certain products from other countries are now sometimes similar or higher, for reasons that make little sense.\n\nFor example, Mr. Trump has imposed a 10 percent “reciprocal” tariff on exports from Britain and Australia, now the same reciprocal rate as for China. The administration says that tariff is directed at offsetting the U.S. trade deficit, but the United States runs trade surpluses with both Britain and Australia, while it racked up a nearly $300 billion trade deficit in goods with China last year.\n\nThe United States also runs a trade surplus with Brazil. But Mr. Trump has put a 50 percent tariff on goods from Brazil and India, amid spats over Brazil’s treatment of a former president and India’s refusal to credit Mr. Trump in making peace with Pakistan. Mr. Trump has also imposed a 39 percent tariff on Switzerland in response to the country’s trade surplus with the United States, even though much of that recent trade has been gold bullion that investors have imported to hedge against tariffs.\n\nCanada, America’s closest ally, faces a 35 percent tariff that Mr. Trump imposed in part because of his claim that Canada is a significant source of fentanyl for the United States. While in practice many goods coming from Canada are exempted through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the nominal rate is still much higher than China’s 10 percent fentanyl tariff, despite far more fentanyl coming from China than Canada.\n\nCountries in Southeast Asia, where many companies have moved their factories after leaving China, typically now face a reciprocal tariff of 19 or 20 percent, the same as or slightly lower than the base line tariff on China. But economists said countries like Vietnam and Cambodia could be heavily affected by the administration’s plans to put an additional tax on goods that are made with a certain proportion of Chinese content.\n\nFor many companies that have spent years planning an exodus from China, an overall tariff reduction of 10 percent on goods made in China is not big enough to lead to any sudden strategic changes. Companies also remain wary that the U.S. trade truce with China could quickly crumble, as it has before.\n\n“Ten percent isn’t quite enough to move the needle,” said Cameron Johnson, a supply chain consultant in Shanghai. He said many of his clients are still waiting to see how things play out when Mr. Trump meets with Mr. Xi again in China next year.\n\n“There is a bit of skepticism about whether this will hold. You’re not going to move your factory or production for six months and a 10 percent reduction,” Mr. Johnson said, referring to a comment Mr. Trump made last week about visiting Beijing in April.\n\nCompanies, particularly larger ones, have found ways to weather the volatility in the U.S.-China relationship by diversifying their supply chains through partnerships with factories in neighboring countries like Vietnam, or setting up their own factories outside China. Across southern Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City, dozens of sprawling new industrial parks have popped up amid the influx of demand for a factory alternative to China.\n\n“I don’t think you’ll see companies moving out of Vietnam, India and elsewhere to go back to China. It’s the big number that actually matters,” said Adam Sitkoff, the executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi.\n\nBut many smaller companies have not had the resources to diversify their supply chains. The truce between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi will provide some relief for firms that are too small to negotiate new factory deals in other countries and depend on Chinese factories for highly technical work.\n\n“It’s a strange moment of celebration,” said Patrick Soong, whose Portland, Ore., firm, Allitra, helps American companies find manufacturers in Asia. Referring to the recent agreement to cut U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, he said, “Ten percent is not nothing and it’s effectively made China 10 percent cheaper for all of our customers.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmxv3m8mwzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"06:08:29.096+00:00","title":"Sir Anthony Hopkins: I can't take credit for my success","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article profiles Sir Anthony Hopkins, the acclaimed British actor and author of the memoir We Did OK, Kid, highlighting his personal journey from childhood bullying and emotional trauma to becoming a global acting legend.

recital by Sir Anthony Hopkins.\n\nBut that's exactly what happened when our four-strong BBC team went to interview the double Oscar-winning actor in Los Angeles.\n\nWe were in the same room as the man who terrified as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, shattered as a butler in The Remains of The Day and devastated as a dad with dementia in The Father.\n\nAn actor who was cast by Oliver Stone as President Nixon because - according to Sir Anthony - the director said \"you're nuts like Nixon\".\n\nAt a grand piano in a hotel in Beverly Hills, as he plays us a piece he calls Goodbye, it's clear an artistic soul exudes from his every pore. Haunting notes of music, lines of poetry and Shakespearean verses cascade out of him.\n\nWe were meeting because Sir Anthony's publishing his autobiography, We Did OK, Kid, an honest and at times upsetting account of a loner who was bullied and written off as a child in Wales and became one of Britain's finest acting exports.\n\nHe puts his success down to sheer luck, telling me: \"I couldn't take credit for any of it, I couldn't have planned any of this - and now at 87, about to turn 88, I get up in the morning and I think, 'Hello, I'm still here,' and I still don't get it.\"\n\nFrom the outside, it looks less about luck and more about his deep understanding of human emotion, as his performances testify. I ask what makes him such an instinctive actor.\n\n\"It's such a miracle being alive,\" he says.\n\nHe finds the complexity of human beings \"fascinating... I mean, how can you produce Beethoven, Bach and then Treblinka and Auschwitz?\"\n\nSir Anthony has always understood the duality of being human, and it explains his acting range.\n\nHe got his first break on film when the actor Peter O'Toole suggested he audition for the 1968 movie The Lion in Winter, in which O'Toole was playing Henry II.\n\nAt that point, Sir Anthony had been a member of Sir Laurence Olivier's National Theatre company for several years. But, he recalls: \"I couldn't fit into the British theatre style, I just felt out of it.\"\n\nHe also \"didn't want to be standing on stage holding a spear for the rest of my life, in wrinkled tights, I just wanted to have a bit of a life\".\n\nHe was cast as Richard the Lionheart and couldn't believe that a baker's son from Port Talbot was working with Katharine Hepburn.\n\nThe actress, playing his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, gave him \"the best advice I've had\" as they rehearsed their first scene together. She told him to \"just speak the lines... Don't act, just do it\". She also said he was \"real good\".\n\nHepburn was right, of course. Some classically trained theatre actors, particularly back then, didn't appreciate how much they needed to adjust their performance for the intimacy of a camera. He did.\n\nHe doesn't much care for talking about the craft of acting, or certainly the reverence there can be around it, but he shares his method with me: \"Be still. Be economic. Don't act or twitch around, you know, 'showing off' acting... simplify, simplify, simplify'.\"\n\nHis performances stand out because he's an actor of huge emotional depth and psychological insight. Think of him as Dr Treves, the friend and protector of John Hurt's Elephant Man.\n\nOr as Lecter, still for me the most terrifying of characters more than 30 years on. The serial killer is a monster but Sir Anthony understood that less is more, on screen.\n\nInstead of playing Lecter as obviously monstrous, \"you go the opposite way, you draw back\", he explains. He realised as soon as he had read a few pages of the script that the role was \"a life-changer\".\n\nHe writes in his memoir that he \"instinctively sensed how to play Hannibal. I have the devil in me. We all have the devil in us, I know what scares people\".\n\nHe tells me he played Lecter still - and deadly. So when he was in character opposite other actors, he decided, \"Don't take your eyes off the person. That's terrifying.\"\n\nHe puts on Lecter's metallic rasp for me and appears to enjoy repeating his character's words to Jodie Foster's Clarice. \"You're not real FBI,\" he almost hisses.\n\n\"That's scary,\" he says. He's not wrong. Even in an upmarket LA hotel on a warm autumn afternoon, I'm feeling chilled.\n\nAnd what about the famous line - \"I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\", which he follows with that vampire-like hiss?\n\nHe explains as a child he'd seen the Hungarian-American actor Bela Lugosi do the same when playing Count Dracula in the 1931 movie. Sir Anthony decided in the moment of filming to copy it and The Silence of the Lambs director, Jonathan Demme, kept it in.\n\nWhat is startling about the memoir is the disconnect between how the world viewed the young actor and how much it was clearly missing about him. He was bullied at school for what other kids saw as his large \"elephant\" head.\n\nHe was slapped around by teachers who deemed him a complete dunce. Even his parents pretty much wrote him off.\n\nHe believes it was the making of him. It \"gave me a core of anger, resentment and revenge\", he says.\n\nBut why hadn't they all noticed his talents? This was a child who was given the 10 volume Children's Encyclopaedia when he was six (\"I was so captivated, I read every one of them\") and became fascinated by astronomy.\n\nA boy who played the piano, made art and loved Dickens and Shakespeare, quoting from them extensively.\n\nA school report in 1955 when he was 17 marked \"the turning point\" in his life. It was terrible, as usual. \"What's going to happen to you?\" Sir Anthony recalls his father lamenting. \"I said: 'One day, I'll show you, both of you'.\"\n\nHe's pleased his parents lived long enough to see him succeed. When he won his first best actor Oscar, for The Silence of the Lambs in 1992, 11 years to the day after his father died, he rang his mother in Wales and said: \"I guess I did OK.\"\n\nBut it was a rough ride in the early days. He was an alcoholic who picked fights with directors and others. He wasn't always a good husband to his first two wives. Booze turned him nasty.\n\n\"That's the ugly side of alcoholism,\" he writes. \"It brought out a brutal side of me. I'm not proud of it at all.\"\n\nThe anger, he believes, came \"from inside, my own insecurities, being bullied at school and all the rest of it. I didn't like authority\".\n\nThen one night in LA in December 1975, almost 50 years ago, he drove his car while in \"a complete alcoholic blackout\". When he came to, he realised that he was \"out of control\" and could have killed someone. He made a phone call to ask for help.\n\n\"Suddenly, something said 'it's all over, now you can start living'... the craving left and it's never come back.\"\n\nAt his first meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, he had a realisation about everyone else in the room.\n\n\"They're all misfits like me. Like all of us. We feel we never belong. We feel self-hatred. All of us are the same. I'm not alone.\"\n\nIt's that feeling of disconnection that shines out of the book.\n\nHe writes that his wife Stella believes he is on the autism spectrum which is \"likely right, given my proclivity for memorisation and repetition... and my lack of emotionality\" but he says he prefers the term \"cold fish\". I want to know why.\n\nIt seems to have begun as a reaction to the bullying and screaming at him through school and National Service.\n\n\"I'd just stare them out, and that drove them mad,\" he recalls. \"You withdraw into yourself and think, 'OK you can't hurt me, can you?\" It was, he says, his \"only defence... and that's a power, you see: I don't care.\"\n\nOf course, Sir Anthony does care and we talk a little about the state of the world. It's at this point in our interview that he becomes his most passionate. He grew up in Port Talbot surrounded by people who had been impacted, even brutalised, by war.\n\nHe played Sir Nicholas Winton, the man who saved hundreds of mainly Jewish children from the Nazis, in the film One Life.\n\nWhen I ask him about whether he worries about increasing polarisation now, he becomes very animated and intense.\n\n\"The world has always been a place of utter turmoil. But I think if we go on in this way of hatred... we are dead.\n\n\"Nobody's allowed to have an opinion. Nobody can have a different view. That's fascism. And it's insanity.\"\n\nIf he has any advice about it all, it's to say \"'Come on, stop this rubbish, beating each other up over ideas. They're only ideas and we're only going to be dead one day'.\"\n\nI ask him, as he looks back at his long life, what his biggest regrets are and he's quick to answer. \"People I've hurt over the years, the stupid things I did.\"\n\nHe's estranged from his only child, his daughter Abigail, who he walked out on when she was just one and he was in the depths of alcoholism.\n\nHe writes that \"after realising I was unfit as a father for Abigail, I vowed not to have any more children... I couldn't do to another child what I'd done to her\".\n\nHe has tried to repair their relationship over the years.\n\nWhen he took on the role of King Lear in his 80s, in Sir Richard Eyre's 2018 film, Lear's words to his daughter Cordelia struck a painful chord.\n\nHe writes in his new book: \"The line that hit me harder than perhaps any other I've ever spoken was 'I did her wrong'. Saying those words, I felt deeply, perhaps for the first time in my life, how I had hurt my own daughter.\n\n\"I remembered how as a baby she'd lit up when I walked into the room. I remembered how I said goodbye to her the night I walked out. I remembered how I had tried and failed to win her back later. I remembered how I had given up. And as Lear, but also as myself, I began to cry.\"\n\nHe didn't want to talk about it in our interview. Poignantly, in this section of the book, he writes: \"I hope my daughter knows that my door is always open to her.\"\n\nI couldn't help feeling moved reading this. It's as if he is trying to send a message to her, hoping against hope that there might be a reconciliation before it is too late.\n\nAt 87, he is looking back, aware he has lived many years longer than he has left to live. \"Most of my friends have died, they're gone, God bless them,\" he says. \"I hope to be around a little longer. But even that, I'm thinking, 'oh well, I had a good time'.\"\n\nHe certainly still appears to be having fun. After some early reserve when we first met, he quickly relaxed. When he played the piano, he shared how he had lost two much-loved pianos when his house burnt down in the LA fires earlier this year. \"They were all under the rubble\".\n\nAs we walked through the hotel lobby together, he was spotted by guests and waved happily to them. \"I like to say hi because people think actors are special. We're not at all,\" he smiles.\n\nWhatever he says, it was special to spend a few hours in his presence. He's an acting legend who's given us six decades of memorable performances. He's also a genuine heavyweight who is steeped not just in musical knowledge, but culture, history and philosophy.\n\nAnd we end the interview on a philosophical note - as he recites \"They are not long, the days of wine and roses\" from an Ernest Dowson poem and muses on the fleeting nature of life.\n\n\"What are we doing here, what  are  we?\" he asks. \"We can't explain anything about ourselves. We may have fancy ideas, religious ideas, philosophical ideas, scientific ideas... what's that all about? We're nothing finally, and yet we're everything\".\n\nWe Did OK, Kid by Sir Anthony Hopkins is published on 4 November."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/opinion/bill-gates-climate-change-apocalypse.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"06:00:14-05:00","title":"Bill Gates Has a Point","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article critiques the doomsday narrative surrounding climate change, arguing that while climate change is a serious problem, it is not a planetary end for humanity.

Point\n\nPublished: 2025-11-02T06:00:14-05:00\n\nOn Tuesday, after picking up strength in an abnormally warm ocean, Hurricane Melissa tore through Jamaica, wreaking havoc and eventually claiming at least 50 lives across the Caribbean. Hours before Melissa, a Category 5 hurricane, made landfall, Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist, released an audacious memo arguing that climate change “will not lead to humanity’s demise.”\n\nFor almost two decades, many environmentalists have argued that the burning of fossil fuels poses an existential threat to all of human civilization. As a result, much of the conversation about global warming has become steeped in the language of extinction and planetary catastrophe.\n\nBut these dark visions ignore a simple fact: Climate change is not a giant meteor crashing into Earth. We will not all suffer equally.\n\nThose whose lives are threatened by climate disaster are not merely the victims of bad luck. When heat waves strike, the dead are predominantly people who are unhoused, older or living alone in substandard housing. Around the world, the neighborhoods that repeatedly flood are disproportionately home to poor families who lack the means to evacuate, fortify their homes against worsening storms or permanently move out of harm’s way.\n\nWith over $100 billion to his name, Mr. Gates is arguably one of the least appropriate people to police language on the climate crisis, given that he won’t shoulder the worst consequences. His memo also glossed over the possibility of runaway warming within our lifetimes and the destruction of nature.\n\nYet he is generally correct when he writes, “Climate change is a serious problem, but it will not be the end of civilization.”\n\nWhen pundits, journalists and scientists talk about the climate crisis as the dawn of a new era in history, they plaster over the long-simmering injustices that create climate vulnerability in the first place: poverty, oppression, conflict and colonization. Whether in New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward or in Bangladesh, climate change threatens to destroy the lives of the same people whose families have already endured generations of hardship.\n\nIn the United States and around the world, the affluent typically can afford to flee a disaster and rebuild a damaged home. A stable income and financial savings can make the difference between a tragedy that upends a year and a tragedy that upends a life.\n\nCompassion and outrage are appropriate responses in the face of this injustice. But when those of us who are relatively climate-safe indulge in visions of planetary apocalypse, we can lose sight of our own complicity and become mired in feelings of victimhood. I know an affluent couple in Connecticut whose house kept flooding during rainstorms, so they moved to the hills. “I guess you could say we’re climate refugees,” the husband told me while we dined outdoors one summer evening.\n\nThis is where the doomsday narrative goes from simply wrong to unhelpful. In a 2024 study of nearly 16,000 young Americans’ attitudes toward climate change, roughly six in 10 participants agreed with the statements “Humanity is doomed” and “I question whether the work I put into my career, job or vocation will matter.” A majority of the same participants also conceded, “I’m hesitant to have children.”\n\nIt appears that the story of climate doom has licensed a toxic fatalism across part of an entire generation. Tellingly, some peer-reviewed studies by environmental psychologists have found that people reporting high levels of climate anxiety are not necessarily more likely to undertake environmentally motivated actions, such as eating less red meat.\n\nIt’s also essential to consider the perspective of some of the most climate-vulnerable communities in the nation, such as the remote Alaska Native villages where I conduct research. In some instances, entire towns in Alaska will have to relocate to higher ground or risk the sort of devastation that struck two Yup’ik villages in the southwest corner of the state just last month. The Indigenous leaders in these communities have no use for victim narratives — theirs or anyone else’s — yet their future depends in part on American voters and taxpayers acting to make sure the villages have the resources they need to survive the climate crisis and remain whole.\n\nWhen the more climate safe among us refuse to identify as victims, we can still grieve for our communities and the places we love that are suffering irreparable harm. Although climate change poses relatively little threat to my neighborhood in Berkeley, Calif., I feel an ache in my chest when I visit my hometown, Portland, Ore., in the summer and see Mount Hood on the horizon. Its glaciers are becoming mere echoes of the places where, as an aspiring teenage mountaineer, I first learned to use an ice ax and crampons.\n\nThe challenge before many of us is to channel our fear and grief about the climate crisis into choices that safeguard the future: how we provide aid to the most vulnerable, and how we heat and cool our homes, travel, eat and, above all, vote. We commit a grave error when we indulge the fantasy of universal vulnerability — that the world is becoming generally inhospitable to human life. For while we all live on one planet, there are many worlds separating the real victims of climate change from the bystanders.\n\nStephen Lezak is a researcher at the University of Oxford and the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the politics of climate change.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

the only child of Marlene Dietrich, the audacious, androgynous and libidinous Teutonic screen siren and cabaret star — and whose bombshell biography of her mother, published a year after her death in 1992, explored the terrible cost of her fame — died on Wednesday in Gila, N.M. She was 100.\n\nHer son Peter confirmed the death, at his home, where she had been living for the last year and a half.\n\nMs. Riva was born in Berlin; her father, Rudolph Sieber, was a dashing assistant director who had cast Dietrich as an extra in one of her first film roles. They married in 1923. As her mother’s career took off, Ms. Riva grew up mostly in Hollywood, on the Paramount Pictures backlots.\n\nSchool was out of the question; Dietrich considered the English language vulgar and Americans even more so, and in any case she wanted her daughter — “The Child,” as she referred to her — by her side, as handmaiden and personal assistant.\n\nIt was Josef von Sternberg, the Vienna-born director who was Dietrich’s Svengali and lover — he had made her an international star, and won her a Hollywood contract, with “The Blue Angel” (1930), the first of their seven films together — who taught Ms. Riva some useful American words and phrases, among them “soundstage,” “makeup” and “wardrobe department.”\n\nShe grew skilled at caring for her mother’s costumes and props, at stamping her autograph on publicity photos, and at staying quiet on set. Dietrich’s costume designer made her a special uniform and gave her a title: “attendant to Miss Marlene.” For years, she thought “Maria Daughter of Marlene Dietrich” was her proper name; she was also never quite sure of her age, which changed as often as that of her mother, who regularly shaved off the years.\n\nFamily life, to say the least, was unusual. Mr. Sieber, who was based in Paris, would arrive now and then with his cowed Russian mistress, Tami, in tow, to oversee Dietrich’s finances and Ms. Riva’s deportment and to archive his wife’s letters — all of her letters, most of which were from her lovers, which arrived in droves and Dietrich often read aloud. Ms. Riva loved those visits, because it meant affection from Tami, the nurturer in the ménage, who played nanny to Ms. Riva and housekeeper to her parents.\n\n“Dietrich was the queen,” Ms. Riva told The Los Angeles Times in 1994. “My father was her major-domo, her lovers were her suitors, and I was the lady in waiting. I didn’t think it was strange; I had nothing to compare it to.”\n\nNo school meant no companions her own age. Those she counted as friends were the least obsequious of Dietrich’s lovers — the English actor Brian Aherne, who sneaked her copies of Shakespeare plays, was a particular favorite — and her bodyguards, who were in constant attendance after a kidnapping threat following the murder of Charles Lindbergh’s baby. One of them gave her a frog as a pet.\n\nWhen she was about 12, she had her first encounter with actual children, an invitation to Judy Garland’s birthday party. She was terrified: What did real children do together? She and Judy huddled on the porch and bonded over their strange, caged existence, while the guests, none of whom were known to the birthday girl, proved adept at the current youth vernacular and a mysterious game called spin the bottle.\n\nUntil Ms. Riva was a teenager, her mother’s many male and female suitors left the house before dawn, keeping up the ruse, for The Child, that they were just good pals. (In those early years, to name just a few, the cast included Mr. von Sternberg, Maurice Chevalier, Gary Cooper, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and the poet and playwright Mercedes de Acosta, who was also a lover of Greta Garbo’s.)\n\nThey often reappeared in the morning, freshly dressed in their street clothes, for breakfast. Dietrich was as enthusiastic about her cooking as her nighttime adventures. But the pantomime must have grown exhausting to all the players, Ms. Riva assumed, as her mother began billeting her with governesses in hotels and rented houses.\n\nDietrich’s sexual adventures were the stuff of legend — from Gen. George S. Patton to Colette to Adlai Stevenson — with a cast that expanded through the decades.   During a stint in London, Ms. Riva wrote, there might be Michael Arlen for breakfast, Christopher Fry for lunch, Kenneth Tynan for tea and “a sexy new Swedish blonde to supper.”\n\nJohn Wayne, with whom Dietrich starred in three films in the early 1940s, was an outlier, seemingly impervious to her charms. Years later, he told Ms. Riva, who asked him why he didn’t succumb: “Never liked being part of a stable.”\n\nDespite all the action, Dietrich was not a fan of the act itself. At least not with men. She preferred fellatio, or, better, impotent men. “They are nice,” she told her daughter. “You can sleep and it’s cozy.”\n\nMs. Riva’s nights were not so cozy. One governess-companion raped her repeatedly, most nights, for over a year. Ms. Riva became a teenage alcoholic, and suicidal. She married, briefly, in her late teens.\n\nBy age 20, Ms. Riva was divorced, still drinking heavily and drifting, as she put it, in San Francisco, where she worked for a kindly drag performer. (Her mother was in Europe with General Patton’s First Army.) She was good at her job: As she put it, “A trained-by-Dietrich dresser can function very nicely as handmaiden to a female impersonator of Sophie Tucker.” He cared for her, fed her and housed her for a time — she had been living on ketchup and bourbon — but she began hoarding sleeping pills and still had suicidal thoughts.\n\nBut then a friend handed her a copy of “The Neurotic Personality of Our Time,” the groundbreaking book by Karen Horney, the German psychoanalyst and anti-Freudian, that examined the societal underpinnings of emotional suffering. She said it saved her life.\n\n“I found myself in it,” she told The Chicago Tribune in 1993, and it made her feel less alone.\n\nMs. Riva got sober, moved to New York City and began to work, hard, as an actor. She joined a U.S.O. company and toured Europe until the war ended, whereupon she returned to New York. She met William Riva, a set designer, while she was directing a play with the producer Albert McCleery at Fordham University. They fell in love, and they married in 1947.\n\nThough she disapproved of the marriage, Dietrich was a relentless presence in the Riva household, dictatorial in the nursery after the birth of their first child, Michael, in 1948. Yet when Life magazine put Dietrich on the cover that August, proclaiming her “The Most Glamorous Grandmother,” she was annoyed. “It automatically makes my age a subject for great discussion,” she told The New York Times in 1952. “That is ridiculous. It is quite common to have grandchildren at 35.” She was 51 at the time.\n\n“What is it like, to have a mother no one knows?” Ms. Riva later wrote. “Must be nice.”\n\nMaria Elizabeth Sieber was born in Berlin on Dec. 13, 1924. But it wasn’t until her father’s death in 1976, when she found her birth certificate among his papers, that she learned how old she really was. (He and Dietrich never divorced.)\n\nMs. Riva did get a bit of schooling for a few years at a Swiss finishing school; Dietrich, as was her habit, phoned her daughter incessantly, pulling her out of exams and hockey games, clearly suffering from the absence of her handmaiden. Ms. Riva also studied acting at the director Max Reinhardt’s workshop in Hollywood.\n\nAfter her marriage, Ms. Riva became a prolific television actor, under contract to CBS, appearing in more than 500 teleplays and a number of commercials. She also toured in theatrical productions. But when her fourth son, David, was born in 1961, she gave up acting to focus on her family, though she continued to participate in telethons for cerebral palsy, volunteer work she had embarked on at the urging of Yul Brynner (another Dietrich swain). She also produced her mother’s cabaret act as long as Dietrich was able to perform.\n\nIn addition to her son Peter, Ms. Riva is survived two other sons, Paul and David; eight grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. William Riva died in 1999. Their son Michael died in 2012.\n\nDietrich’s final years were spent alone in a squalid Paris apartment, though not because of penury or neglect: She didn’t like visitors, and, crippled by various ailments, she was lax about hygiene and often used random housewares as bedpans. She passed her days on the phone with her fans and old lovers, sedated by a cocktail of pills, alcohol and quack medicines, spinning fantasies and upending truths, tending to the legend as best she could.\n\nIn 1993, a year after Dietrich’s death at 90, Ms. Riva published “Marlene Dietrich,” a book years in the making, mostly to critical acclaim and enormous publicity.\n\nMolly Haskell, writing in The Times, called it “the ultimate act of demystification, a startling and riveting work.”\n\n“I think those of us who live with great fame have to say that it is a trick of survival and that a lot of us don’t like it,” Ms. Riva told Diane Sawyer in a 1993 television interview. Writing the book, she said, was a necessity.\n\n“Power must not be allowed to triumph all the time,” Ms. Riva said, recalling her virtual servitude as a child. “It mustn’t be forgiven no matter what it does, because it’s beautiful, because it’s famous, because it’s powerful.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/style/new-york-marathon-fashion.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"13:42:32-05:00","title":"8 Memorable Looks at the New York City Marathon","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of runners participating in the 54th annual New York City Marathon, showcasing their unique and creative costumes, from banana suits to cow onesies, anime characters, and Barbie-inspired looks.

He was committed to keeping it on for all 26.2 miles.\n\n“The zippers are pretty difficult to unpeel,” said Mr. Cruanes, 26, a medical student in Denver.\n\nThe race has a reputation for rollicking crowds and exuberant racecourse fashion. Before sunrise, runners packed into Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island wearing rainbow bathrobes and Barbie costumes, face glitter and hats shaped like chickens.\n\nIn the below interviews, which have been edited and condensed, the runners broke down their looks and explained why they had chosen to run the marathon in style.\n\nChicago and Northern Virginia\n\nHow did you decide on the cow onesies? Miki: We actually have unicorn onesies as well, but they were a little bit too heavy. We figured if we didn’t want to get too hot, we would just go with the cows.\n\nHave you run a marathon together before? Charmaine: That’s my daughter. We do all our marathons together.\n\nMiki: This will be 52 for me, so I think it’s, like, 55 for you.\n\nWhat makes the New York City Marathon special? Charmaine: The 55,000-plus of our friends hanging out and having a good time. I’m actually running in the age group championship, but I’m not trying to win today. It’s about fun for the both of us.\n\nDo the bells make noise? Miki: A little bit. We’ve seen some other cows. Next time we see them, we’re going to moo.\n\nGreenpoint, Brooklyn\n\nWhat inspired your hair? I love the Olympian Alexi Pappas, and she runs in many crazy styles like this. So I started just doing two pigtail braids and I tied in ribbon and a shoelace. My dad passed away, so I always have a shoelace for him.\n\nHow many hair ties did it take? Probably about 15.\n\nWhat part of the marathon are you most excited about? My apartment is on the course at the halfway point, so I’m very excited to see my mom, and all of our family and friends. I actually just got married a month ago, so I’ll get to see my wife. She has a megaphone.\n\nTriBeCa, Manhattan\n\nAre you Ken from “Barbie”? It was the girlfriend’s plan — she’s a big fan of that movie, and I liked the movie too, especially Ken’s character.\n\nIs she running the marathon, too? No, she’s fast asleep.\n\nHow do you feel in the costume? We were out clubbing and I’m still pretty hung over right now. Dead tired. I think we went to bed at like 2:30, so I figured I was going to be tired anyway.\n\nAre you carrying any part of Ken’s attitude with you? Openness, excitement for new discoveries, motivation and determination.\n\nTalk me through your look. I found a hat from the marathon last year, and matching glasses. I used the yellow flower for the pop. And then the lipstick. Do I have my lipstick on?\n\nYes! I carry it with me, too. You definitely have to reapply before you go across the finish.\n\nHow many marathons have you run? This will be my 63rd. I’m really a triathlete, but I’m the worst in the water. I joined a running club and I got hooked.\n\nHow do you approach race day? My philosophy is, either you have to be really fast on your feet or you can be cute and slow. If you can’t have a good time, there’s no need to do it.\n\nGreenpoint, Brooklyn\n\nNice mullet. Is it new? Yeah, I’ve never done any hairstyle that’s really out there before. I’ve been living in New York 11 years; I kind of wanted to make this New York City Marathon a big one.\n\nHow does it feel? I feel so aerodynamic.\n\nWhat part of the race are you most excited about? I view this as a big celebration of fitness, so I am trying to just be present the entire way through the marathon. Also, I haven’t been drinking for the last two months, so I’m really excited for that first Miller High Life.\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nWhat made you choose this jumpsuit? I deliberated way too long trying to decide what to wear for the race. I ran the Marine Corps Marathon last weekend, and it was all about focus and dedication. Here, I’m looking to have fun.\n\nWhat made you get into running marathons? In D.C., where I live, there’s a very big, vibrant running community. I look forward to getting up on Saturday mornings and running with my run club, and going home and running with my siblings and parents. It’s such a great way to bring people together.\n\nJersey City, N.J.\n\nWho are you dressed as? I am running as an anime character called Inuyasha. It’s a character my nieces particularly enjoy, so it gives them something to cheer for.\n\nDo you usually run in costume? Yes. My very first costume was Elvis. If you’re running in costume, you get so much more energy from a crowd.\n\nWhat makes the New York City Marathon special? This is going to be my 17th consecutive New York City Marathon. I love the community. No matter what country you come from, you’ll see your nation’s flag on the marathon course, which is absolutely spectacular.\n\nWhat got you into running? I think it’s mostly for mental health. I used to run in college and then I didn’t have that for a while. I think movement is incredibly important for longevity.\n\nHave you ever considered running as a different fruit? Just banana.\n\nIs running as a banana a competitive advantage? I think it brings a little bit of happiness to people’s days. I’ve done a lot of marathons, and it kind of got a little stale after a while.\n\nWhat do spectators yell when they see you? Generally just, “banana!” Yeah, or “go, banana, go, banana man, go!”\n\n"}]}
