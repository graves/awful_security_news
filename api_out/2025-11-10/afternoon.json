The letters, sent by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, told employees they have 70 days from the date of the letter to pay the debts.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA) told employees that the letters were sent out in error due to a glitch that will be corrected once the government is funded. But impacted employees told CNN the letters added to the stress of Defense Department civilians who have been deemed essential and have worked without pay since the shutdown began on October 1. Sources familiar with the letters told CNN it was sent to not only teachers, but principals and other administrative DoDEA employees.\n \n\n   \n  “DoDEA claims it will be corrected at some point after the shutdown ends but gave no indication of when or what the process to correct it will be,” one employee said. “So, in the meantime, DoDEA teachers will continue to not only work for no pay but also be charged a debt for each day we are forced to work without pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Another DOD civilian pointed to longstanding issues with the military’s pay system and said they have little faith the issue will be resolved quickly. A third individual living overseas posted on social media that they received the letter and said the stress “is becoming overwhelming.”\n \n\n   \n  The DoDEA system has 161 schools at home and abroad at US military installations, according to the agency’s website, and teaches more than 60,000 students. As of 2022, there were more than 11,000 full-time personnel within DoDEA.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has ensured active members of the military are being paid throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The director of the DoDEA, Beth Schiavino-Narvaez, told employees in an email on Thursday, which was obtained by CNN, that the agency is aware of the “various pay-related issues.” DoDEA is “working closely with the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) to obtain all necessary information regarding the problems that are employees are experiencing due to payroll status changes,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The issue largely was due to a coding error due to the shutdown, Schiavino-Narvaez’s email said. All employees must be identified by a code for “Leave Without Pay” during the lapse in appropriations for timekeeping purposes, she said. Teachers and administrators’ salaries are based on the number of days in a school year they are paid for, the email goes on to explain, and therefore when a Leave Without Pay code is entered into the pay system, “the payroll system automatically adjusts for overpayment because fewer than the required number of days will be recorded.”\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, due to the age of its system and regulatory requirements, DFAS is unable to override these adjustments, and a debt letter is automatically issued,” the director’s email said.\n \n\n   \n  Schiavino-Narvaez specifies in the email that once the government is funded, timecards will be corrected – but she also told employees that it may take “several pay periods to fully reconcile and cancel” any outstanding debt.\n \n\n   \n  Employees “are not required to make any payments on debt letters at this time,” she said, adding that she recognizes “we are all experiencing extraordinary challenges due to the lapse in appropriations.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  previously reported  that the morale of civilian employees around the globe — many of whom are veterans or military family members themselves — is dropping rapidly with many considering leaving government service.\n \n\n   \n  The first affected DoDEA employee told CNN that to say the director’s reassurances “don’t mean much is an understatement.”\n \n\n   \n  “They have no urgency to correct this and just tell us to basically wait and hope for the best,” the employee said, “because they don’t know how to fix this and don’t seem overly concerned with finding a method to fix this.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/new-delhi-explosion-red-fort-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:23:00.000-05:00","title":"Car blast kills at least 10 people near Red Fort in India’s Delhi","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A car explosion near the Red Fort in Delhi, India, on November 10, 2025, killed at least 10 people and injured over 30 others.

What you need to know \n       \n  By David Goldman, Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump, embattled by America’s growing  affordability problems , has once again floated a unique solution: Sending Americans rebate checks for the tariffs that his administration has collected.\n \n\n   \n  “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump  posted on Truth Social  Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a bold promise with several significant complications.\n \n\n   \n    What Trump proposed\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently floated the idea of tariff rebate checks. Prior to this weekend’s proposal, Trump in August had said Americans could  receive a portion of the tariff revenue .\n \n\n   \n  “We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,” Trump said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  While American importers foot the initial tariff bill, they’ve been passing along some of those added costs to consumers, meaning Americans are indirectly paying for tariffs, too.\n \n\n   \n  The idea sounds similar to stimulus checks that went out in the wake of the pandemic recession — once towards the end of Trump’s first term, in 2020; and again in 2021 when former President Joe Biden was in office. But Trump suggested that these tariff rebate checks could be funded not by a general pool of taxpayer funds but instead from the money collected by US importers who pay the historic tariffs Trump has imposed on a vast number of goods from overseas.\n \n\n   \n    What the Treasury says\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s top economic adviser threw some cold water on the rebate checks.\n \n\n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was noncommittal about the proposal on Sunday in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” Bessent said no formal proposals have been made to distribute tariff revenue and suggested Trump’s mention of a $2,000 payment “could come in lots of forms,” including making up for lost revenue from not taxing tips, overtime and Social Security payments.\n \n\n   \n    Is there even enough money for this?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has collected more than $220 billion in tariff revenue, which includes a mix of various tariffs Trump has imposed and previous tariffs that were in place before Trump took office, according to the US Treasury.\n \n\n   \n  More than 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024, the  IRS said .\n \n\n   \n  So a back-of-the-envelope calculation would put $2,000 stimulus checks at a total cost of about $326 billion. That’s more than the tariff revenue America has collected since Trump’s second term began.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he would exclude wealthy Americans, but it’s not clear where the cut-off would be and whether that could make up for the difference.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an income threshold of $100,000 — far from the highest income tax bracket — around 150 million adults would qualify. That would cost the administration roughly $300 billion, wrote Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  According to a Monday morning social media post, the president seems to think there would be enough money left after tariff rebate checks are doled out to help pay down the nation’s nearly $40 trillion in debt.\n \n\n   \n  “All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens, from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries, which will be substantial, will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official didn’t specify what requirements would need to be met to qualify for a check. “The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,” the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    What about the Supreme Court?\n \n\n   \n  Another complicating factor: The  Supreme Court appears skeptical  of the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. About $100 billion of the total tariff revenue so far has been collected through this method.\n \n\n   \n  If the court rules against the Trump administration, it may have to  return that money to businesses , which would significantly reduce the amount of tariff money available as a rebate for American households.\n \n\n   \n  It could also complicate the process of refunding businesses if money has already been distributed to individuals.\n \n\n   \n    Can Trump do this unilaterally?\n \n\n   \n  Almost certainly not.\n \n\n   \n  Congress maintains the power of the purse, and past stimulus checks have required Congressional approval, and it’s unclear if Trump has enough support to pass something like this.\n \n\n   \n    Would Congress support it?\n \n\n   \n  Although stimulus checks have proven politically popular in the past, they have come almost exclusively during recessions or emergencies. The American economy is in neither at the moment.\n \n\n   \n  Rebate checks could exacerbate rising prices at a time when Americans say  inflation and affordability  are their top concern. Sending out checks could give America’s economy a sugar rush at the worst possible time and could ultimately ding American households if the Federal Reserve needs to hike its benchmark interest rate to counteract rising prices.\n \n\n   \n  That could lose Trump some key votes among fiscal conservatives in his own party.\n \n\n   \n    When would my check come?\n \n\n   \n  Even if the rebate checks get approval, don’t hold your breath.\n \n\n   \n  During the pandemic, Americans who elected to receive direct deposit checks had the money in their bank accounts within about a week of the first stimulus package passing. Where it got much more dicey was for the Americans who elected to receive paper checks. That process took around 20 weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/media/bbc-trump-edit-lawsuit-turness-davie-media","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:15:00-05:00","title":"Trump Threatens to Sue BBC Over Misleading Edit of January 6 Speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump has threatened to sue the BBC over a misleading edit in a 2024 documentary about his reelection campaign, claiming the edit defamed him by splicing together parts of his January 6 speech to falsely imply he said he would walk with supporters to the Capitol and 'fight like hell'.

But party leaders believe lawmakers will, indeed, end the stalemate this week.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what still needs to happen on Capitol Hill to reopen the federal government.\n \n\n   \n    Senate timing agreement and vote\n \n\n   \n  Now, senators need to agree on how long to debate before voting on the final bill. This could move quickly, or be held up by senators who want to drag out the process.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who voted against advancing the measure, wants a vote on an amendment related to hemp grown in his state. It’s unclear if that will happen.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it “remains to be seen” when the Senate will be able to vote on final passage of the bill, though he hopes it passes early this week.\n \n\n   \n  The final package would fund the government until January 30 and some key agencies through the remainder of fiscal year 2026. So that means if the government were to shut down again over the next few months, key federal food assistance known as SNAP would continue to be funded.\n \n\n   \n  Once it passes the Senate, the package heads to the House, which will present its own host of complications.\n \n\n   \n    Then it’s the House’s turn\n \n\n   \n  Members of the House were advised to expect votes this week.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has to sell this package to his razor-thin majority, and he’ll likely need the president’s help to muscle it through his fractious conference.\n \n\n   \n  Praising the Senate for reaching a deal to reopen the government and warning his members to make their way back to Washington, Johnson said Monday: “I’m stating the obvious all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now, returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson said he will give 36-hour notice to House members for a vote as soon as the Senate has final passage of the CR in the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “At least some Democrats,” he said, “now finally appear ready to do what Republicans and President Trump and millions of hard-working American people have been asking them to do for weeks.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, however, has vowed to fight the package because it does not go as far as he wanted on Democrats’ health care demands, so it’s not yet clear how many House Democrats will help Johnson approve it.\n \n\n   \n  House Democrats are set to huddle as a caucus on Monday, according to a personal familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Though the next few days will be critical, a source familiar with the matter said GOP leaders are optimistic about the funding bill’s chances for passage in the House. And a Democratic source familiar expects some in the party will cross lines to support it, though it remains to be seen how many.\n \n\n   \n  Once passed in the House, the bill will go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the bill?\n \n\n   \n  The full bill includes a larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress, in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The package does not include a guarantee from Republicans to extend the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal struck between Republicans and the Senate Democratic centrists, there’s expected to be a future Senate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government said Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies – a key sticking point for the Democratic Party – forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also includes an agreement to reverse all of the federal firings during the shutdown and ensure that all federal workers get paid what they were owed while the shutdown occurred.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/tina-peters-pardon-push-trump","dateOfPublication":"1114-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:04:00-05:00","title":"Trump Being Urged to Intervene in Tina Peters Case, Sources Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tina Peters, a former Republican clerk from Mesa, Colorado, was convicted on state charges of participating in a scheme to prove false claims of mass voter fraud in the 2020 election, specifically involving alleged breaches of voting systems by Dominion and Smartmatic.

Tina Peters case, sources say \n       \n  By Kaitlan Collins, Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:04 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fresh off of  pardoning a slew of allies  who helped him try to overturn the 2020 election, President Donald Trump is being strongly encouraged to intervene in the conviction of Tina Peters, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Peters, the former Republican clerk of Mesa, Colorado, was found guilty last year on state charges of participating in a scheme that hoped to prove Trump’s false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020. She was sentenced to nine years in prison and is serving her sentence at a women’s prison in Pueblo, Colorado. However, because she was found guilty on state charges, Trump cannot outright pardon her — that power belongs to Colorado’s Democratic governor. But that hasn’t stopped her allies from trying to get her out of prison.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people making the biggest push internally on her behalf is Ed Martin, who is serving as the pardon attorney at the Justice Department after he failed to get enough support to serve as the US attorney in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has continued to advocate for relief for Peters in recent weeks, several people familiar with the push told CNN, even though it is extremely unusual for the Justice Department to intervene in a state case this way. The department has already  involved itself  in a long-shot federal case, known as a habeas petition, that Peters filed in March, and urged a federal judge to free her from state prison while she appeals her conviction. That matter is still pending, but a decision is expected this year.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has worked behind the scenes, over the objections of some of his colleagues, to find a way to grant relief for Peters. Responding Sunday to a post about the case on X, Martin wrote, “We are working on it!”\n \n\n   \n  During her sentencing hearing, Peters continued to argue that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump. Colorado state Judge Matthew Barrett told Peters that he was convinced she was not apologetic for her behavior and “would do it all over again if you could.”\n \n\n   \n  “You are no hero,” Barrett told her. “You abused your position and you’re a charlatan.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump lost in 2020, Peters got involved with other right-wing activists who tried to prove Trump’s fraud claims by allegedly breaching voting systems in Colorado,  Michigan ,  Georgia  and other states. They were acting based on false information, including from Trump’s own lawyers, that the 2020 results were rigged against him by machines belonging to Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic.\n \n\n   \n  Peters was  indicted  by a Republican prosecutor and convicted by a jury in her ruby-red county of felonies tied to a data breach in Mesa related to the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly threatened “harsh measures” against Colorado if Peters isn’t freed and has  called  her an “innocent political prisoner.”\n \n\n   \n  He has criticized Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and state Attorney General Phil Weiser, both Democrats. Polis  has said  he won’t pardon Peters as part of any quid-pro-quo deal.\n \n\n   \n  From the La Vista Correctional Facility — a medium-security women’s prison in Pueblo — Peters has continued her advocacy through messages to her allies that they post on social media on her behalf. Last month, she directed her outrage at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “Where is everybody? I did what I was supposed to do” to “legally” expose supposed voter fraud in 2020, Peters wrote, adding, “The President has demanded my release four times… why is the DOJ defying Trump’s demands? Get off your a**es and get me out!”\n \n\n   \n  Peters has apparently latched onto an idea  recently floated  by those on the right that the Justice Department can move her from state prison into a more comfortable federal facility, because she needs protection as a witness in a potential federal probe into supposed 2020 voter fraud.\n \n\n   \n  To that end, her attorneys have claimed they have critical new evidence about the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  They have used her habeas petition to publicize new depositions that they took over the summer, supposedly of anonymous Venezuelan informants who said Dominion and Smartmatic machines can rig American elections — the same false claim that Trump, Peters and other election deniers have peddled since November 2020.\n \n\n   \n  But at a recent hearing, Federal Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak ruled that the depositions weren’t admissible in the habeas case. He also observed that “we’ve seen neither hide nor hair” of the Justice Department in the months after DOJ officials participated an April hearing about its unorthodox intervention in Peters’ case.\n \n\n   \n  One of Peters’ lawyers, Patrick McSweeney, previously told CNN that Peters hasn’t had any direct contact with Trump from behind bars, but she has heard about his desire to get her out, and “she appreciates the president’s interest in her case, which is unusual for him to be involved in an individual matter.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/pregnancy-gun-homicide-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:18:00-05:00","title":"Women face a much higher risk of homicide, especially from guns, during pregnancy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pregnant women in the United States face a disproportionately high risk of homicide, particularly from firearms, with a new study in JAMA Network Open showing that pregnant women have a 37% higher firearm homicide rate than non-pregnant women.

In a meeting, they said her youngest daughter, Francesca Harris-Scarborough, had been killed the night before. Police had found the 31-year-old’s car still idling.\n \n\n   \n  Scarborough’s daughter, who was three months pregnant, had been shot twice in the heart.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t ready for it. I lost control of everything,” Scarborough said. “Everything went blank.”\n \n\n   \n  Francesca is part of a terrible trend in the United States: Homicide is the No. 1 way pregnant women die,  research  has long  shown . A new  study  published Monday in JAMA Network Open shows pregnant women are even more vulnerable than other women of childbearing age when there’s a gun involved.\n \n\n   \n  The study looked at more than 7,000 homicides of women of childbearing age between 2018 to 2021 and found that pregnant women experienced a 37% higher firearm homicide rate than women who aren’t pregnant. More than two-thirds of pregnancy-associated homicides involved firearms.\n \n\n   \n  Research has long shown that the presence of a firearm is a key risk factor of intimate partner homicide. The new study showed that every 1% increase in state-level firearm ownership was significantly associated with a 6% increase in all-cause and 8% increase in firearm-specific homicide rate in pregnant women, even after adjusting for other factors.\n \n\n   \n  “Even incremental increases in firearm availability may contribute to measurable increases in homicide risk in pregnant women,” the study concludes.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really not surprising, if you think about it, that if firearms are more available, then that certainly it does increase your risk of homicide in general,” said study co-author Dr. Lois Lee, a senior faculty advisor, Office and Health Equity & Inclusion and an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. “So you could imagine, if you take away or at least decrease the number of firearms, then there would likely be many fewer deaths during pregnancy.”\n \n\n   \n  “And unlike medical conditions, which, yes, we do have many medical advances and can save many lives, but in some ways, those conditions are much less preventable, like eclampsia and sepsis,” Lee added. “This is predictable and potentially preventable.”\n \n\n   \n  By age group, the highest proportion of homicides in pregnant women was among those ages 20 to 24 years old. For women who weren’t pregnant, it was ages 25 to 29. Most homicides victims were Black, whether they were pregnant or not.\n \n\n   \n  “Those findings suggest that these risks of homicide during pregnancy are shaped not just by individual factors, but by broader systems of inequity and structural racism,” Lee said. “So it’s not just a solution at the individual level that’s needed, but there needs to be urgent change at a policy level as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The study suggests safe storage laws and domestic violence firearm prohibitions.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, did not work on the new study and said that while most states prohibit people with final protective orders from purchasing or possessing firearms, such laws should be expanded to require people to surrender their firearms even when there’s an emergency protective order on the books.\n \n\n   \n  “Usually the first stage of that order process is often the most dangerous time for individuals experiencing intimate partner or family violence, since it is usually the first indication that an individual is going to be separating from an abuser,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Roskam said the most successful gun surrender laws also have strong follow up. She points to a program in King County, Washington, that created  a multi-disciplinary team  of prosecutors, law enforcement, and court administrators that serve on a regional domestic violence firearm unit that scours court documents and databases to make sure every individual involved in a domestic violence offense gives up every firearm. According to  King County , firearms are used in domestic violence homicides more than all other weapons combined in Washington state, and research shows the risk of homicide for women increases sharply when a firearm is present in a domestic violence situation.\n \n\n   \n  “They really show respondents that they are very serious about ensuring this firearm relinquishment compliance. And since they have started doing this, they have been recovering a much larger number of firearms from these protective orders,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Scarborough has been working on her own programs so that more women are spared her daughter’s fate. She created a nonprofit called  Cry Loud, Spare Not, Speak Up  that’s dedicated to empowering women affected by domestic violence and abuse in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  In reading her daughters’ journals after her death, Scarborough said she realized that while her daughter was successful and seemed happy, she had confidence issues that started when she was younger. Scarborough started a program for girls  ages 12 and up  to cultivate self-esteem and grow their confidence.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, near the anniversary of Francesca’s death, Shirley also hosts another empowerment program for girls and women called “I Am Enough, I Know My Worth.”\n \n\n   \n  “This way she will never die, we can always try to help somebody,” Scarborough said. “Her death has really been my teacher.

Hodges  allowed same-sex couples to marry.\n \n\n   \n  The court did not explain its reasoning to deny the appeal, which had received outsized attention – in part because the court’s 6-3 conservative majority three years ago overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion that 1973 decision established. Since then, fears about Obergefell being the precedent to fall have grown.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, love won again,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “When public officials take an oath to serve their communities, that promise extends to everyone – including LGBTQ+ people. The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Mat Staver, the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, the legal group that represented Davis, said the former clerk would now face “crippling monetary damages based on nothing more than purported hurt feelings.”\n \n\n   \n  “Like the abortion decision in Roe v. Wade, Obergefell was egregiously wrong from the start,” Staver said. “We will continue to work to overturn Obergefell. It is not a matter of if, but when the Supreme Court will overturn Obergefell.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court today is far different and far more conservative than the one that decided Obergefell in 2015, which is part of what had given LGBTQ advocates pause about the Davis appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, the key swing vote who authored the Obergefell decision, retired in 2018 and was replaced by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon who was also in the Obergefell majority, died in 2020 and was succeeded by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative.\n \n\n   \n  Three current justices – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito – were in dissent in Obergefell.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy’s opinion spoke eloquently of the most fundamental values of family, love and liberty.\n \n\n   \n  “No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family,” Kennedy wrote. “In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were.”\n \n\n   \n  The Obergefell decision prompted a massive celebration that began outside the Supreme Court on the day it was decided in late June of 2015. That evening, the White House was lit in rainbow colors. Many same-sex couples rushed into courthouses to wed. Nearly 600,000 same-sex couples have since married, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.\n \n\n   \n  But some conservatives viewed the outcome as a betrayal and predicted future conflicts with religion. Davis, who at the time was the clerk of Rowan County in Kentucky, cited her religious objection to same-sex marriage as justifying her decision to withhold marriage licenses to all couples. She was sued by multiple couples in the county, and a jury ordered her to pay $360,000 in damages and legal fees.\n \n\n   \n  After a federal court found she had violated a court order to issue licenses, Davis was also thrown in jail for several days.\n \n\n   \n  Writing in dissent, the late Justice Antonin Scalia blasted the court’s decision as a “threat to American democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The substance of today’s decree is not of immense personal importance to me,” he wrote. “But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today’s judicial Putsch.”\n \n\n   \n  Davis had argued that it was time “for a course correction” on Obergefell.\n \n\n   \n  While virtually all of the focus on Davis’ appeal was aimed at her request to overturn Obergefell, the bulk of case actually dealt with a series of more technical questions. In appealing the damages verdict against her, the former clerk argued that the First Amendment’s religious protections should shield her from legal liability, particularly since she is no longer a public official. The 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument.\n \n\n   \n  Several conservatives justices had signaled in recent weeks that there was no great appetite to reopen Obergefell. Barrett  told the  New York Times  last month there are “very concrete reliance interests” at stake when it comes to same-sex marriage. Alito, while criticizing the precedent broadly during an address in Washington earlier this fall, stressed that it was a “precedent of the court that is entitled to the respect afforded by the doctrine of stare decisis.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, there have been worrying signs for LGBTQ rights groups – particularly when it comes to cases involving transgender Americans. In recent months, the high court handed down a major decision allowing states to ban the use of  puberty blockers and hormone therapy  for trans youth, allowed the Trump administration to bar transgender Americans from serving in the military and allowed the administration to require US passports to include sex markers consistent with a  person’s sex at birth .\n \n\n   \n  Mary Bonauto, a veteran civil rights attorney at GLAD Law who argued the Obergefell case, celebrated the court’s quick rejection of Davis’ appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that has changed since  Obergefell  was decided is that people across the country have seen how marriage equality provides protection for families and children, and that protection strengthens communities, the economy and our society,” Bonauto said. “Today millions of Americans can breathe a sigh of relief for their families, current or hoped for, because all families deserve equal rights under the law.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s decision to decline to hear the Davis appeal sets no precedent. If another appeal arrives threatening to undermine or overturn Obergefell, the court will review that appeal from scratch.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional details and reaction. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/science/nasa-jared-isaacman-project-athena","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:07:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s NASA pick has the space community buzzing with a leaked plan for the agency","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the controversy surrounding Jared Isaacman’s renomination as NASA administrator, following the leak of a 62-page strategic document titled 'Project Athena'.

     11:07 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A 62-page document written by President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again pick to run NASA,  billionaire Jared Isaacman , outlines a sweeping, ambitious, and at times controversial plan for the space agency.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman, who was  tapped  to be NASA administrator after Trump was elected in 2024, only to see his nomination  retracted  months later, was  renominated  for the top job last Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  While Isaacman has publicly acknowledged the leaked document, which is labeled May 2025 but was recently leaked to several news outlets, he  said  in a social media post that “parts of it are now dated.” He did not specify which portions were obsolete.\n \n\n   \n  It nonetheless set off a flurry of speculation about how the space agency would function with Isaacman at the helm. A copy of the document was obtained and authenticated by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In his statement, which was posted the day of his renomination, Isaacman  said  that “Project Athena,” as the paper is titled, “was always intended to be a living document refined through data gathering post-confirmation.”\n \n\n   \n  “I would think it is better to have a plan going into a responsibility as great as the leadership of NASA than no plan at all,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  Among the proposed goals are revamping some NASA centers to focus on nuclear electric propulsion, establishing a new Mars exploration program, and embracing an “accelerate/fix/delete” philosophy to reshape the agency.\n \n\n   \n  If enacted, many of the policies laid out could significantly alter the day-to-day lives of NASA workers and transform the 67-year-old agency.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it is presenting a more dramatic set of changes than many in the space community were expecting,” said Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society, of the document.\n \n\n   \n  Some lawmakers have also expressed concern about how Isaacman might seek to reform NASA campuses across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman still faces a confirmation vote in the Senate and would need Congressional approval for many of the objectives mapped out in the document.\n \n\n   \n  As a tech CEO — who made his fortune by founding payments company Shift4 at age 16 and has twice  flown to orbit  on self-funded SpaceX missions — Isaacman is an unorthodox pick for NASA’s top role.\n \n\n   \n  Space agency administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics and public servants.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman has also garnered broad support within the commercial space industry, where he’s perceived as an energetic outsider ready to usher NASA into a new era.\n \n\n   \n    A power struggle\n \n\n   \n  According to a source familiar with the matter, the original Project Athena document was more than 100 pages. Isaacman made only three hard copies of a truncated 62-page version and distributed them to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and his chief of staff. The leak — according to a recent Ars Technica report and a source who confirmed the account to CNN — looked to have been part of an effort by Duffy, who is temporarily running NASA, to spur controversy and potentially thwart Isaacman’s renomination.\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously  reported  that Duffy has said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Duffy previously denied that he’s said he wishes to remain in the NASA administrator job, and Isaacman said in his social media statement, posted after the “Project Athena” document was leaked, that he believes Duffy has “great instincts and is an excellent communicator.” (The spokesperson for Duffy did not offer comment for this story.)\n \n\n   \n  “If there is any friction, I suspect it is more political operators causing the controversy,” Isaacman said.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman was renominated for the NASA post on November 4, one day after reports about the Athena document began circulating in the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I think (the people who leaked Project Athena) thought this would ruffle feathers amongst the delegations that care about human spaceflight,” said one former NASA official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private document. “I will tell you — it hasn’t worked.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to nearly a dozen senators whose home states have NASA centers that could be pegged for major changes, according to the Project Athena document. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland — the home of Goddard Space Flight Center — offered the most detailed responses.\n \n\n   \n  Van Hollen said in a statement that he had met with Isaacman earlier this year and he “looks forward to another hearing to discuss further with him why the next space race and the search for habitable planets runs through Maryland.”\n \n\n   \n  “To protect our nation’s innovation leadership, he must be more than a rubber stamp for the Administration’s chainsaw approach to our space science initiatives,” Van Hollen said.\n \n\n   \n  Warner, whose state houses NASA’s Langley campus, urged Isaacman to “engage with Congress and reconsider any plan that threatens these world-class facilities and the communities that depend on them.”\n \n\n   \n  “The reported proposals to downsize or privatize key missions at Langley and Wallops would be a serious mistake, jeopardizing critical scientific capabilities and the talented workforce whose expertise keeps the United States at the forefront of aerospace research,” Warner’s statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  No lawmaker reached by CNN indicated how they intended to vote on Isaacman’s confirmation.\n \n\n   \n    A Mars shot and nuclear propulsion\n \n\n   \n  One eye-popping proposal in Project Athena is to set up a new Mars program, dubbed “Olympus.”\n \n\n   \n  Much of that vision, the source familiar with the document told CNN, was intended to align NASA with SpaceX’s goal of sending an uncrewed Starship spacecraft to the Martian surface next year.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX’s plan, which CEO Elon Musk  discussed  publicly in May, “was going to be a more-or-less free mission that SpaceX was going to do anyway,” the source said. The thinking was that NASA could step in to provide support through the Olympus program at minimal cost to taxpayers, according to the source.\n \n\n   \n  The document also includes numerous mentions of setting up an expansive program to pursue nuclear electric propulsion — which involves powering spacecraft engines with electricity from small nuclear reactors. The technology could one day provide steady, long-lasting power for faster and more flexible deep-space missions, including Mars travel.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has pushed publicly for expanding such research, writing in an August op-ed for  RealClearScience  that he coauthored with Newt Gingrich that the space agency should focus on tasks and research “no other agency, organization, or company is capable of accomplishing.”\n \n\n   \n  Nuclear electric propulsion is an example of such a focus area, the op-ed argues.\n \n\n   \n  “Our competitors are not waiting. China and Russia are investing heavily in nuclear space technologies. If America wants to lead, NASA must take on the hard problems again and do the near-impossible,” Isaacman and Gingrich wrote in the article.\n \n\n   \n  Project Athena also suggests setting up a demonstration mission to dock a nuclear electric propulsion spacecraft with a crewed vehicle in orbit, according to the leaked paper.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s nuclear vision also proposes that NASA centers working on projects like the  Space Launch System rocket  — including the Marshall and Michoud facilities in Alabama and Louisiana — shift their focus to nuclear electric propulsion development when the SLS program concludes.\n \n\n   \n  When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said Tuberville had not met with Isaacman yet but he “will, of course, ask about Marshall.”\n \n\n   \n  The source familiar with the document noted that it was crafted around the same time the Trump White House drafted the President’s Budget Request, or PBR, which called for canceling NASA’s SLS rocket and some other major projects that could have left multiple NASA centers without a cornerstone program.\n \n\n   \n  The source said that Isaacman began compiling the Project Athena document in late 2024 and updated it as he had conversations with policymakers. The source also said that Isaacman did not help draft the PBR.\n \n\n   \n  With this summer’s “Big Beautiful Bill” expressly extending the SLS program through at least the next four missions, it appears Isaacman may delay implementing a bold new focus on nuclear electric propulsion research.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman  said  November 4 on social media that he hopes to zero-in on those pursuits only after a “foundation” of lunar exploration has been built.\n \n\n   \n    To the moon\n \n\n   \n  When the Project Athena document was drafted in early 2025, Trump had already signaled a renewed interest in Mars — even mentioning exploration of the planet in his  inaugural address  while staying silent on NASA’s ongoing efforts to return astronauts to the moon.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman echoed Trump’s Mars ambitions during a confirmation hearing in April, saying he intended to pursue exploration of the red planet in tandem with NASA’s moon program. However, questions about how he would fund such projects  loomed .\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, however, the moon has emerged as the  clear policy priority  amid a renewed space race with China, which is aiming to land its taikonauts on the lunar surface by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  The recent push to bolster NASA’s moon missions, including a $10 billion influx Congress gave the agency’s human spaceflight efforts in July, “brings clarity to the topic,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman is back in the running for the top NASA job at a time when the agency’s plans for a crewed moon landing, called Artemis III, are  in flux .\n \n\n   \n    Shifting lunar plans\n \n\n   \n  The Artemis III mission, which is slated to launch later this decade, currently hinges on SpaceX’s Starship ferrying NASA astronauts down to the lunar surface.\n \n\n   \n  But some policy experts have grown increasingly  concerned  that Starship — the most powerful rocket ever built — is too large, novel and complex to meet NASA’s urgent timeline.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy recently signaled  a willingness to boot SpaceX  off the project, saying he would ask the company and its chief competitor, Blue Origin, to show how they could expedite development of their respective lunar landers.\n \n\n   \n  Those remarks prompted an acerbic response from Musk, a friend of Isaacman’s, who referred to the interim NASA leader as “ Sean Dummy .”\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has not publicly said whether he would support sidelining SpaceX from the Artemis III mission. But a source familiar with the matter said that Isaacman has expressed an intention to partner with whichever company most quickly produces an astronaut-worthy lunar lander.\n \n\n   \n  The Project Athena “plan never favored any one vendor, never recommended closing centers, or directed the cancellation of programs before objectives were achieved,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The plan valued human exploration as much as scientific discovery,” Isaacman said. “It was written as a starting place to give NASA, international partners, and the commercial sector the best chance for long-term success.”\n \n\n   \n    Uncertainty for science\n \n\n   \n  The source familiar with the Project Athena document said some of the more controversial aspects of the plan warrant more explanation.\n \n\n   \n  One line item in the document, for example, states that Isaacman intends to take “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and leave it for academia to determine” — a proposal that critics say said could impede the nation’s ability to gather crucial environmental data.\n \n\n   \n  The document also maps out similar policies that could be applied across many of NASA’s initiatives, such as recommendations to embrace “science-as-service” for future projects.\n \n\n   \n  Such measures, calling for researchers to focus on purchasing data from the private sector, could mark a significant change for the agency.\n \n\n   \n  Similar policy philosophies have been tried at NASA, particularly in the 1990s during a “better, faster, cheaper reformulation,” Dreier noted. But enthusiasm waned for that approach when a  pair of Mars missions  were lost.\n \n\n   \n  And the commercial space industry may not be in a position to take up all the tasks Isaacman’s Athena document suggests it can, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It places a lot of faith on the commercial marketplace to deliver in ways that it hasn’t had the chance to fully be tested on,” Dreier said.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s social media statement also acknowledges his “science-as-a-service” concept “got people fired up” but clarified that he intended to focus on purchasing data from Earth observation satellites: “Why build bespoke satellites at greater cost and delay when you could pay for the data as needed from existing providers and repurpose the funds for more planetary science missions (as an example)?”\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has also publicly defended science programs such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was slated for budget cuts in the PBR. And he stated he’d be willing to spend his own money to get the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope off the ground. “I was prepared to personally cover the cost to launch Roman — if that’s what it took to get to the science,” Isaacman said in a June social media  post . (That same promise appears in the Project Athena document.)\n \n\n   \n  “Anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue,” Isaacman’s November 4 statement reads.\n \n\n   \n    A rankled workforce\n \n\n   \n  Among the other proposals in the Project Athena document are plans to hasten NASA’s reorganization. The agency has already lost roughly 4,000 of its 18,000 employees as part of the Trump administration’s deferred resignation program.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman said in his social media statement last week that he wishes to move away from rolling out piecemeal change and instead implement “a single, data-driven reorganization aimed at reducing layers of bureaucracy between leadership and the engineers, researchers, and technicians.”\n \n\n   \n  Extensive changes, however, could further disgruntle a workforce that has been  reeling  from looming budget cuts and what employees have  described  as political distractions and discordant communication from leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s document also details myriad other plans to change how the agency operates — such as conducting a sweeping review of NASA’s boards and committees to suspend any that “delay decision making,” and reimagine the space agency’s approach to risk assessment.\n \n\n   \n  “We will ensure safety is at the forefront of our decisions but achieving the mission of NASA means accepting that some risks are worth taking,” the document reads.\n \n\n   \n  Former NASA astronaut and SpaceX advisor Garrett Reisman, who has long said he believes NASA may have become too risk-averse in the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster, told CNN in a November 8 phone interview he was encouraged to see that Isaacman hopes to reevaluate that aspect of the agency.\n \n\n   \n  It would be unwise, he added, to start eliminating safety organizations — but they could be revamped to create a “healthy tension” between risk assessors and engineers seeking to push boundaries.\n \n\n   \n  However, he cautioned that “it’s really hard to know in the moment if you’re going too far or not,” Reisman said. “It’s a very difficult thing to do, so I wish him good luck.”\n \n\n   \n    A leader of change\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman is generally well regarded across the space industry, where he has largely been viewed as a passionate leader who can enact visionary change.\n \n\n   \n  In an emailed statement, Dreier, the Planetary Society executive, acknowledged that the Project Athena document “was prepared in a different era.” NASA has since received billions of dollars for projects including lunar exploration, Dreier noted, and science advocates have demonstrated an outpouring of opposition to Trump’s proposed cuts to research.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s renomination to the NASA chief job now presents “a good opportunity to engage on some of these proposals, particularly as they relate to science,” Dreier added.\n \n\n   \n  In his social media post, Isaacman said that, if the Project Athena document becomes public, “I will stand behind it,” adding that he believes “there are many elements of the plan that the space community and NASA would find exciting.”\n \n\n   \n  But he did not wish to debate the plan “line-by-line while NASA and the rest of the government are going through a shutdown,” according to the November 4 post.\n \n\n   \n  More broadly, Isaacman has suggested he intends to enter the NASA job with an open mind and adjust course based on feedback.\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post in June, for example, Isaacman wrote that he “didn’t love” being approached by “people who thought they were uniquely NASA’s savior.” He added: “I have little interest in doing the same.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/weather/arctic-blast-chicago-snow-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00-05:00","title":"Over a foot of snow piles up in the Great Lakes as Arctic blast spreads across much of the US","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A record-breaking cold snap from the Arctic is causing extreme winter-like conditions across the eastern U.S., with over a foot of snow falling in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and areas near Lake Michigan, including up to 10 inches in northwest Indiana and 6 inches in Lake County, Illinois.

\nUpdated: \n        10:57 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Intense lake-effect snow is creating dangerous travel conditions   in the Great Lakes   and it’s all   being fueled by a record cold snap sending the eastern half of the United States into a brief bout of winter.\n \n\n   \n  The snow   developed overnight in Chicagoland along with thunder and strong winds.   Forecasts for the city on Sunday called for potential historic November snow totals over 10 inches,   but the heaviest bands of snow   have so far spared   the downtown area from those kinds of totals.\n \n\n   \n  Lake-effect snow totals  often swing wildly from location to location  depending on where heavier bands develop because of how narrow they are.\n \n\n   \n  That’s what we are seeing this morning near Lake Michigan. Up to a foot of snow has fallen more than 50 miles south of Chicago, and totals north of the city in Lake County, Illinois, have reached 6 inches in spots. Dangerous travel conditions from snow and strong winds have been reported along Interstate 57 south of Chicago in Kankakee and northern Iroquois counties in Illinois, the  National Weather Service said. \n \n\n   \n  Chicago proper has been in a lull after an overnight burst of snowfall but could pick up another 1 to 2 inches. Cook County,   Illinois,   which includes downtown Chicago, has been downgraded from a winter storm warning to a winter weather advisory since less snow is now expected.\n \n\n   \n  The snow threat stretches beyond Chicago across the Great Lakes. It’s being spawned by a rush of Arctic air that’s unusually cold for November pushing south and east and threatening dozens of low temperature records as far south as Florida over the next couple of days.\n \n\n   \n  Over a foot of snow has fallen in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. In northwest Indiana, up to 10 inches of snow has fallen in spots, with more accumulation expected the rest of the day. Several inches of snow will pileup in the eastern Great Lakes through Tuesday, particularly in the snow belts of northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and southwest New York.\n \n\n   \n    Record-setting cold to start the week\n \n\n   \n  This brutal winter-like setup in the Midwest is being driven by the same Arctic air mass that’s crashing across the eastern two-thirds of the country. This isn’t just a “cold front.” This is a full-scale polar plunge.\n \n\n   \n  Some southeastern cities could face some of their coldest early-November temperatures in decades on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  Daily record lows will be threatened parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, the Carolinas, southeast Louisiana and even Florida. That includes places like Birmingham and Huntsville in Alabama, Baton Rouge in Louisiana, Savannah in Georgia and Tampa and Fort Myers in Florida.\n \n\n   \n  Jacksonville, Florida, is predicted to hit 30 degrees Tuesday morning, marking the earliest it’s been that cold in fall since 1976. That would also be the case in Savannah, Georgia, if the low drops to 28 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday daytime highs in Florida could be some of the coldest on record for the date. Melbourne, Florida, could see its earliest day below 60 degrees since records began there more than 85 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Cold weather advisories for wind chills in the 20s or lower 30s have been issued in Florida for Monday night into Tuesday morning as far south as Naples. Freeze warnings cover parts of several other states in the Southeast.\n \n\n   \n  Washington, DC, and New York City are also likely to log their coldest morning of the stretch on Tuesday. DC could wake up near 30 degrees﻿. New York only reaches a high in the mid-40s Tuesday afternoon. Morning wind chills in both cities could sit in the lower to mid-20s.\n \n\n   \n  There will be snow in other regions as well. Lake-effect snow continues downwind of the Great Lakes. The west slopes of the central Appalachians could pick up several inches Monday. Higher elevations from West Virginia through the border of North Carolina and Tennessee can expect accumulating snow.\n \n\n   \n  The good news: The cold snap won’t stick around long. Temperatures across the central US rebound quickly on Tuesday, and most of the East warms up again on Wednesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/ghislaine-maxwell-special-treatment-commutation-raskin-whistleblower","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:43:00-05:00","title":"Ghislaine Maxwell gets special treatment in prison, Rep.

Jamie Raskin said he learned from a whistleblower that Ghislaine Maxwell is receiving special treatment in prison and is in the process of filing a commutation application.\n \n\n   \n  The Maryland Democrat detailed the whistleblower allegations in a strongly worded letter sent to President Donald Trump, revealing what he says he learned about Maxwell’s prison stay.

For other inmates, mail can take weeks to arrive or is often lost, Raskin said in the letter, which was reviewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The whistleblower also said Maxwell was given a service dog in training to play with even though inmates and staff are not typically allowed to pet service dogs in training, and she has been escorted to the prison exercise area after hours by prison guards, according to the letter.\n \n\n   \n  The whistleblower told Democrats that one of the top officials at the prison has complained that he is “sick of having to be Maxwell’s b*tch.”\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department did not immediately provide comment to CNN for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Raskin also said in the letter that Maxwell is working on a “commutation application,” though its exact contents and whether it had been submitted was not immediately clear.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, Raskin is asking President Donald Trump to make Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche available for a public hearing, a request that is unlikely to be met given Democrats’ position in the minority.\n \n\n   \n  “What information is Ms. Maxwell agreeing to suppress in order to receive such outlandishly favorable treatment as a federal prisoner and convicted sex offender?” Raskin wrote to Trump.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/hormone-therapy-menopause-fda-warning-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:50:00-05:00","title":"Black box safety warning to be removed from hormone therapy for menopause","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is removing the long-standing black box warning on hormone therapy for menopause, a move based on updated scientific evidence showing that such therapy is safer and more beneficial for women under age 60 or within 10 years of menopause.

menopause \n       \n  By Jacqueline Howard, Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:50 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a pivotal move, the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday said  it is taking steps to remove the lengthy “black box” warning  on many hormone treatments for women with menopause symptoms — a shift expected to give women more options for treatment and generate a flood of new prescriptions.\n \n\n   \n  Hormone therapy has long been on the market, but prescriptions plummeted after 2003, when the warning described increased risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, breast cancer and dementia.\n \n\n   \n  Prescribing requires nuance, FDA officials said Monday. Hormones should be used in women who are younger than age 60 or within 10 years of menopause. Some women still face some risks from hormones, including women at increased risk of blood clots or who have previously had breast cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is requesting that drug manufacturers remove black box warnings from these products,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary  said in an opinion  in The Wall Street Journal. “These are the strongest drug warning the agency can require, and they have inappropriately scared women off from this life-changing, and sometimes life-saving, treatment.”\n \n\n   \n    What changed around hormone therapy\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning is the strongest type of alert the FDA puts on a drug label. Since 2003, labels of  menopause treatments  that contain estrogen – including pills, patches, sprays and creams – have warned that their use can increase the risk of uterine and breast cancers, as well as strokes and blood clots. The labels also warned about an increased risk of dementia for women over the age of 65.\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning, or boxed warning, was added after  a large government-funded study , the Women’s Health Initiative, found in 2002 that women taking estrogen pills after menopause had some higher health risks compared with women who took a placebo. The study participants had an average age of 63, so many were past menopause when they started the therapy.\n \n\n   \n  After the study and the label change, doctors became reluctant to prescribe them and prescriptions for hormone therapy for menopause dropped by more than 70%. In the late 1990s, more than 1 in 4 postmenopausal women were taking hormones to manage symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and night sweats. By 2020, that number had dropped to about 1 in 25,  one study found .\n \n\n   \n  The result has been undertreatment of symptoms that can be debilitating for women in midlife.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been a total horrible tragedy that so many millions of women have been deprived,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, a New York-based internist and author of the books “ Don’t Let Your Doctor Kill You ” and “ The New Hormone Solution .”\n \n\n   \n  “Hormone therapy is important because for about 10 to 15 years before you go into menopause, your hormones start leaving you. As your hormones start leaving you, you need more hormones. And you don’t need hormone replacement – you need hormone supplementation,” Schwartz said.\n \n\n   \n  “Chronic illnesses like heart disease, Alzheimer’s, osteoporosis, cancer, they are diseases of aging, and one reason is the loss of hormones.”\n \n\n   \n  More recent analyses of the Women’s Health Initiative,  as early as 2010 , have since shown that hormone therapy started in women younger than 60, or within 10 years of starting menopause, can more safely help manage menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and poor sleep as long as the women don’t have specific contraindications such as a history of hormone-sensitive breast or uterine cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “To this day, I still have patients coming in telling me their obstetricians or gynecologists have said to them they shouldn’t be taking hormones, because they’re going to get cancer. And not only will they not get cancer, the hormones will protect them from cancer,” Schwartz said. “We have the data.”\n \n\n   \n  In July, the FDA convened a panel of experts to discuss the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for women. The panelists urged the agency to remove the warning label.\n \n\n   \n  “I am begging the FDA, and all of us are begging, please remove the box label,” Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine said during the event. “And please stop harming women.”\n \n\n   \n  In October, Makary  told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta  in an episode of the “Chasing Life” podcast that the agency was in “serious discussions” about what to do with the black box warning.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really a tragedy. It’s maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine,” Makary said. “It’s resulted in 50 million women being denied this incredible therapy.”\n \n\n   \n    Changing views on menopause\n \n\n   \n  The FDA action follows a wave of policies introduced across the country to improve menopause care at the state level. Most of the legislation has been related to insurance   coverage for menopause care, awareness and education, clinician training or menopause in the workplace.\n \n\n   \n  “When we think about the timing of this announcement, it’s not just the FDA making a move. It comes in the good company of now 19 states, red and blue alike, introducing more than 35 bills to improve menopause care,” said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, executive director of the Birnbaum Women’s Leadership Center at the  New York University School of Law , who has been tracking menopause legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “All these things are happening at the same time, and that’s in part because there is a loud and proud movement making these demands now, insisting that menopause care be equitable and treatments accessible, that menopause no longer be in the shadows and that we not be subject to misinformation,” said Weiss-Wolf, author of the forthcoming book, “When In Menopause: A User’s Manual and Citizens Guide.”\n \n\n   \n  The removal of the warning on hormone for menopause has long been in the making, several experts who spoke to CNN said.\n \n\n   \n  “Back in 2014, the Menopause Society and other leading menopause experts had actually started  a petition to the FDA  to remove the label,” Weiss-Wolf said. “This is something that the menopause medical community has been asking for.”\n \n\n   \n  The action will change the landscape of care to make hormone therapy, especially estrogen, more accessible for midlife women, said Dr. Jayne Morgan, an Atlanta-based cardiologist and vice president of medical affairs at Hello Heart, an app that specializes in women’s health and cardiovascular research.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact of the matter is – estrogen is one of the primary drivers of the heart. There are estrogen receptors on the heart, on the brain, in the bones, so it’s like the fuel that drives our body. Once that fuel runs out, it’s just like a car, the car begins to sputter,” Morgan said.\n \n\n   \n  “Women live about  six years longer  than men, but we spend about 25% of our lives in lower quality of life,” she said. “That’s where hormone therapy can help.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/mail-in-ballots-supreme-court-mississippi","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:56:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Agrees to Decide If Mail-in Ballots Can Arrive After Election Day","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether states can count mail-in ballots received after Election Day, following a Republican-led lawsuit challenging Mississippi’s law that allows ballots to be received up to five days after Election Day if postmarked by that date.

Monday  to decide whether states may count mail-in  ballots received after Election Day , taking up a Republican-led lawsuit that could affect election laws in more than a dozen states across the country.\n \n\n   \n  It is the latest of several high-profile voting cases to make it on to the Supreme Court’s docket this year as the justices are asked to deal with controversies dating back over the past several elections.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen states allow regular mail ballots to be accepted after Election Day, including  presidential battleground Nevada . Most of the nation’s battleground states – including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – require ballots to be received by Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Other states accept military ballots after Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  A Mississippi law, enacted during the Covid-19 pandemic, allows ballots to be received up to five days late, so long as they are postmarked by Election Day. The Republican National Committee and others sued over that law, claiming the provision violated a federal law that fixes the date for the election.\n \n\n   \n  “With rare outliers, the states mandated that ballots must be received by election officials by election day,” the RNC told the Supreme Court in written arguments this year. “But recently, an increasing number of States – including Mississippi – have deviated from that practice by permitting at least some ballots to be received after election day.”\n \n\n   \n  Officials in Mississippi, where  Trump carried more than 60% of the vote , have questioned the RNC’s logic. An election, they told the Supreme Court, is the choice of an official.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters make that choice by casting – marking and submitting – their ballots by election day. The election has then occurred, even if election officials do not receive all ballots by that day,” Mississippi officials said in written arguments. “Under Mississippi law, voters cast their ballots by election day.”\n \n\n   \n  Raising doubts about ballots that were not counted until after Election Day was key to President Donald Trump’s efforts to delegitimize the 2020 election. The question in the case is about ballots that were received after the election, not ballots that are received before the election but not counted until later.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that Mississippi was  violating federal law by counting mail ballots that arrived after Election Day , but the court notably stopped short of blocking the state’s policy before the 2024 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court is already considering other important cases involving voting and elections. It heard arguments in October in a case challenging the power of the Voting Rights Act to limit  discrimination in redistricting . The Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority  signaled deep skepticism  in that case over the creation of a second majority Black district in Louisiana in a case that could have nationwide implications.\n \n\n   \n  And a majority of the court late month indicated it would likely back a Republican congressman from Illinois who is challenging a state law that allows  mail ballots to be received after Election Day , a decision that would let him proceed with a potentially explosive lawsuit that lower courts had rejected.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:34:00-04:00","title":"Canada loses its measles elimination status amid large outbreak","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after experiencing continuous transmission of the measles virus for over 12 months, beginning in October 2024.

Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:59 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has pardoned a long list of his political allies for their support or involvement in plans to overturn the 2020 presidential election, according to the Department of Justice’s Pardon Attorney, Ed Martin.\n \n\n   \n  The individuals listed in a proclamation, which Martin  posted on X  late Sunday, include high-profile figures like former   Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and the president’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, among dozens of others.\n \n\n   \n  “This proclamation ends a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 Presidential Election and continues the process of national reconciliation,” read the document, which gives the date of November 7 in its text and the president appears to have signed.\n \n\n   \n  It includes a “full, complete, and unconditional pardon” for those named, including some of the president’s co-defendants who were charged in Georgia for trying to  subvert Trump’s 2020 election defeat .\n \n\n   \n  The pardons mark the latest step Trump has taken to absolve or protect his allies who tried to overturn the 2020 election. Those efforts culminated in the violent riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. One of his first official acts in his second term was to pardon over 1,000 people who were charged or convicted in the January 6 ​attack.\n \n\n   \n  Presidential pardons only apply to federal charges, not state or local charges. None of the people on the list are currently charged with federal crimes, though some were named as unindicted co-conspirators in special counsel Jack Smith’s election subversion case against Trump, which prosecutors withdrew after Trump’s 2024 election victory.\n \n\n   \n  However, state-level criminal charges are still pending against Giuliani, Meadows, many of the 2020 fake electors, and others on the pardon list. (They deny wrongdoing.) These 2020-related state prosecutions are ongoing in Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada. These figures will likely try to use the pardon to aid their defense, though a presidential pardon doesn’t cover state crimes.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon also explicitly states that it does not apply to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon covers Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official in 2020 who  tried to weaponize   the department’s powers to overturn the election. (Clark is now a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget.) Like Giuliani and Powell, Clark was an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal 2020-related indictment against Trump,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Clark said in  an X post  Monday that Trump had called him on Friday to inform him about the pardon. He said that he never asked for a pardon, defended his actions in 2020, and thanked Trump. But he also acknowledged the limits of clemency action.\n \n\n   \n  “I wish I could be declaring this legal nonsense over for good — a pardon should totally and abruptly kill off these federal bar and Georgia-federal attacks on me and many others,” Clark wrote. “Sadly, that’s not immediate reality.”\n \n\n   \n  Powell and Giuliani, both of whom served as Trump’s personal lawyers, were at the center of the sprawling conspiracy theories which baselessly claimed the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. Giuliani  played a leading role  in the “fake electors” scheme which sought to block then-President-elect Joe Biden from taking office by presenting certificates from battleground states which falsely said Trump won the election, during the Congressional counting of the electoral votes on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Two of the architects of the fake electors scheme — lawyers  Ken Chesebro  and John Eastman — were also pardoned. Chesebro previously pleaded guilty in the Georgia election racketeering indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Also pardoned were Jenna Ellis, Trump’s 2020 campaign lawyer, and former Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward and her husband, Michael Ward.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis had been accused of working to spread false claims about widespread voter fraud. She  pleaded guilty  in the Georgia case and struck a cooperation deal that led to her Arizona charges  being dropped . The Wards were accused of acting as fake electors in Arizona. Also pardoned was Boris Epshteyn, a Trump campaign lawyer who prosecutors alleged  helped organized  the scheme and later served as one of Trump’s personal lawyer during his New York criminal trial in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the people Trump pardoned as “great Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  “These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,” Leavitt said. “Getting prosecuted for challenging results is something that happens in communist Venezuela, not the United States of America, and President Trump is putting an end to the Biden Regime’s communist tactics once and for all.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Martin’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Also last week, the president  granted clemency  to a retired New York City police officer who was convicted in 2023 for stalking a New Jersey family on behalf of the Chinese government.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also pardoned former Major League Baseball star  Darryl Strawberry  for a 1995 tax evasion charge.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/boat-strike-76-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:07:00-05:00","title":"US military strikes 2 boats, killing 6 in Eastern Pacific","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military launched two strikes in the Eastern Pacific against suspected drug boats operated by organizations designated as terrorist entities, killing six people and destroying two vessels.

The BBC altered the speech to suggest Trump called for violence, when in reality he said he would walk to the Capitol to cheer on lawmakers. The internal memo, leaked by former editorial advisor Michael Prescott, revealed this manipulation, leading to accusations of bias and a loss of public trust. BBC chair Samir Shah apologized, acknowledging the error and pledging to uphold impartiality.

misleading edit of Trump speech \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno and Mitchell McCluskey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:04 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two top leaders at the BBC resigned on Sunday amid an escalating scandal over impartiality and bias that plunged Britain’s public broadcaster into one of its biggest crises in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s most senior executive, director general Tim Davie, and the chief executive of the news division, Deborah Turness, both quit after the leak of a deeply critical memo that, among other things, revealed that the BBC had misleadingly edited a  speech  by US President Donald Trump to make it appear that he had directly called for violence on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In a note to staff on Sunday afternoon, Davie said his resignation was “entirely my decision.” He added that as director general, he took “ultimate responsibility” for mistakes made by the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  Turness said the controversy over a documentary made by the BBC’s “Panorama” series had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.”\n \n\n   \n  “The buck stops with me,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Samir Shah, chair of the BBC, on Monday apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over the way Trump’s speech was edited.\n \n\n   \n  The resignations come after the Telegraph newspaper published details of a leaked internal BBC dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on editorial standards and guidelines.\n \n\n   \n  In an internal whistleblowing memo, Prescott revealed that last year the BBC had broadcast a “doctored” Trump speech, making it seem that the president had encouraged Capitol Hill rioters, telling them he was going to walk with them to “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Trump said in his speech in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, that “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump welcomed the news of the resignations and thanked the Telegraph for “exposing” corruption, which he called a “terrible thing for democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a presidential election,” he  wrote  on his Truth Social platform.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to British lawmakers on Monday, Shah, the chairman, conceded that “the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action,” for which the BBC apologized. He stressed “it is absolutely clear the BBC must champion impartiality,” adding that the broadcaster will take action to make sure it “retains the trust and confidence of the public we serve.”\n \n\n   \n  The allegations led White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt to blast the BBC as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine.”\n \n\n   \n  British taxpayers are being “forced to foot the bill for a leftist propaganda machine,” Leavitt said in a recent interview with the Telegraph.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Leavitt posted a  brief response  to X, presenting the headline from the Telegraph article, followed by the BBC article announcing Davie’s resignation.\n \n\n   \n  After the report of the dossier emerged, Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., shared it on X, writing: “The FAKE NEWS ‘reporters’ in the UK are just as dishonest and full of s— as the ones here in America!!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Lisa Nandy, the British secretary of state for culture, media, and sport, thanked Davie for his work at the BBC after he announced his resignation.\n \n\n   \n  “He has led the BBC through a period of significant change and helped the organisation to grip the challenges it has faced in recent years,” Nandy said in a  post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Now more than ever, the need for trusted news and high quality programming is essential to our democratic and cultural life, and our place in the world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch applauded the resignation but said that there is a “catalogue of serious failures that runs far deeper” at the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  “The new leadership must now deliver genuine reform of the culture of the BBC, top to bottom - because it should not expect the public to keep funding it through a compulsory licence fee unless it can finally demonstrate true impartiality,” Badenoch  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC is largely  funded  by a £174.50 ($228) license fee paid annually by every household in the United Kingdom that owns a television or watches its streaming content.\n \n\n   \n  As a public broadcaster, the organization is held to standards on its editorial independence and fairness.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC, whose charter  describes  its mission as providing “duly accurate and impartial news” in the public interest, has been pulled into controversy repeatedly over the years.\n \n\n   \n  BBC chairman Richard Sharp  resigned  in 2023 after a report found he failed to disclose his involvement in facilitating a loan of almost $1 million to former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC  faced a boycott  in 2023 after it suspended Gary Lineker from hosting the flagship soccer show after the former soccer player criticized the government’s asylum policy as “immeasurably cruel.” Lineker was later reinstated.\n \n\n   \n  In 2012, director general George Entwistle  resigned  after a BBC report  falsely implicated  a senior British politician in a child abuse scandal.\n \n\n   \n  The director of news, Helen Boaden, and her deputy, Steve Mitchell, were  asked  to temporarily “step aside” later that year pending the outcome of an internal review related to a police investigation of sexual abuse by former BBC presenter Jimmy Savile.\n \n\n   \n  In 2004, BBC director general Greg Dyke  resigned  after facing intense pressure over a government inquiry into a Ministry of Defense employee who died after being revealed as a source in a BBC report which claimed that the government had knowingly “sexed up” a dossier on whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/europe/louvre-heist-fedora-man-french-teenager-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:25:00-04:00","title":"Louvre ‘fedora man’ revealed: Meet the stylish teen dresser snapped at scene of heist","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 15-year-old boy, Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, from Rambouillet, France, gained global attention after being photographed at the Louvre museum on October 19, 2025, during a high-profile heist involving the theft of the French crown jewels.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As all eyes turned to the Louvre after the  shocking theft  of the  French crown jewels , one especially stylish figure on the museum grounds caught the internet’s attention: a sharply dressed young man, wearing a three-piece suit and a fedora tilted just so.\n \n\n   \n  As speculation swirled about the identity of the so-called “French detective” pictured at the scene, 15-year-old Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, who featured in the photo, was enjoying his new double life.\n \n\n   \n  The teenager met CNN at his home in Rambouillet, about 30 miles southwest of the French capital, to discuss the social media furor.\n \n\n   \n  Though he may cite fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot as a style icon, Pedro confirmed that he was not involved in any investigations and that he had not been able to locate any of the €88 million ($102m) stolen crown jewels.\n \n\n   \n  He learned about the viral photo when a friend showed him a TikTok video with the now-famous image. The video had nearly 6 million views.\n \n\n   \n  “In the moment, it was, like, very funny. And we went back to the Louvre to see the reaction of the people,” he told CNN. “People maybe recognized me, but I’m not sure.”\n \n\n   \n  Pedro had planned to spend October 19, the day of the Louvre heist, at the famed museum with his mother and grandfather. When the trio arrived to find the museum closed, the stylish highschooler was unknowingly photographed by an AP journalist documenting the crime scene.\n \n\n   \n  What many online commentators had deemed a detective outfit is simply Pedro’s everyday look.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s important to dress classic. And I like to dress like that because I love history, especially the 20th century,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The young history buff has been embracing 40s-era fashion for almost a year now, he said. His obsession with the style began when he dressed as Jean Moulin, a hero of the French resistance during World War II, for carnival, a festive period celebrated in many countries ahead of Lent. Amid the parades and costumed festival-goers, he found a liking for the new look.\n \n\n   \n  “He realized the effect he had on other people,” his mother, Félicité Garzon Delvaux, explained. “Everyone looked impressed. Okay, something is happening there.”\n \n\n   \n  Since then, he has adopted the vintage style everywhere, even at school.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many of his classmates, Pedro does not own sweatpants. He is not, however, above reaching for the cargo pant on occasion.\n \n\n   \n  Good taste has long been a topic of discussion for the Garzon Delvaux family.\n \n\n   \n  Pedro’s mother, who brought him to the Louvre on that eventful day, grew up in Chartres, about 50 miles southwest of Paris, “in a museum” with an art curator for a mother and a prolific French storyteller for a father.\n \n\n   \n  In their home in Rambouillet, paintings, antiques and knick-knacks line walls and shelves in a manner reminiscent of an exhibition.\n \n\n   \n  “The beauty of things is always very important in our family,” Félicité affirmed.\n \n\n   \n  Due to her husband’s job as a diplomat, the family moved often, living in England, Spain, Bangladesh, and eastern France before returning to Rambouillet four years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the Pedro’s most striking pieces have been gathered from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  His vintage Soviet watch, for example, was bought in an antique store in Calcutta and repaired with parts that he sourced from Bulgaria with his father.\n \n\n   \n  His first tailored suit was commissioned at the age of 12 during a year spent in Bangladesh.\n \n\n   \n  Asked what he wants to do in the future, Pedro said he was interested in pursuing diplomacy like his father and paternal grandfather, or perhaps joining the military.\n \n\n   \n  The young man conceded that the uniforms may have something to do with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  But despite his carefully cultivated appearances, Pedro remains an enthusiastic young man of his own generation.\n \n\n   \n  When asked if his friends at school appreciate his style, he was quick to respond.  “Yeah, I think I have a lot of aura.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/alcohol-heavy-drinking-stroke-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00-05:00","title":"Protect Your Brain by Cutting Down on Alcohol Consumption","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in the journal Neurology in November 2025 finds that heavy alcohol consumption — defined as three or more drinks per day — is linked to earlier onset of bleeding strokes, with participants consuming that amount experiencing brain bleeds on average 11 years earlier than those who drink less.

Gina Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:00 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s second nature for some people to pour a glass of wine on a nice evening or to pop open a can of beer during a sports event — but when does drinking become too much?\n \n\n   \n  Heavy alcohol use, which researchers defined as regular alcohol consumption of three or more drinks per day, is linked to more severe brain bleeds (or a bleeding stroke) and earlier long-term brain damage, according to a study published November 5, in the journal  Neurology .\n \n\n   \n  “A bleeding stroke, or intracerebral hemorrhage, is when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, causing blood to leak out and damage the surrounding brain tissue. Bleeding strokes account for about (15% to 20%) of all strokes,” Dr. Mitchell Elkind, chief science officer of brain health and stroke at the American Heart Association, said in an email. He was not part of the study.\n \n\n   \n  “The other kind of stroke, about 80%, is an  ischemic stroke , in which a clot or blockage of the blood vessel occurs and there is a lack of blood flow to part of the brain, causing it to die from lack of oxygen and nutrients,” Elkind said. “Bleeding strokes are typically more dangerous and disabling.”\n \n\n   \n  Some  17%  of adults in the United States binge drink and 6% drink heavily, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2024,  29.7 million  Americans ages 12 and older had alcohol use disorder, a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption that can cause impairment of physical or mental health.\n \n\n   \n  “People who were drinking an average of three glasses of alcohol per day had their brain bleeds on an average of 11 years younger than compared to people who were drinking less glasses of alcohol,” said Dr. M. Edip Gurol, the study’s lead author.\n \n\n   \n    Who is at risk of a bleeding stroke?\n \n\n   \n  In the United States,  795,000 people  experience a stroke each year, and 10% of those are bleeding strokes.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, anyone — even children — can have a bleeding stroke. But the risks go up quickly with age, especially after age 55 or so,” said Elkind, professor emeritus of neurology and epidemiology at Columbia University. “The most important risk factor for brain hemorrhage overall is high blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension increases with age. Recently we have been seeing more strokes in younger people due to increasing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in young adults.”\n \n\n   \n   Nearly half of American adults , or 119.9 million people, have hypertension or high blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Some  symptoms  of high blood pressure include headaches, shortness of breath and nosebleeds.\n \n\n   \n  “Another important cause of strokes in younger people is the use of illicit substances: so not just alcohol, but use of cocaine, methamphetamine and other stimulants, heroin and other injected drugs, can lead to strokes and brain hemorrhages,” Elkind said. “Alcohol — and stimulants, in particular — can increase blood pressure, leading to higher risk of strokes of all types, including bleeding.”\n \n\n   \n  Other than stroke,  hypertension  can also cause chronic kidney disease, heart disease and artery disease.\n \n\n   \n  “For patients who had a brain bleed or patients who have MRI markers of higher than usual brain bleeding risk such as brain microbleeds, I recommend them to completely stop alcohol intake or use it very sparingly,” said Gurol, a vascular neurologist at Mass General Brigham, suggesting no more than up to six times per year and never exceeding more than a glass over 24 hours.\n \n\n   \n    Decreasing your risk of a bleeding stroke\n \n\n   \n  Elkind recommends getting your blood pressure under control to help prevent a stroke.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it checked by a doctor or at a local pharmacy,” he said, “and if elevated, get it under control through lifestyle change and medication, if needed.”\n \n\n   \n  An easy way to lower blood pressure is to do aerobic exercises, such as  walking . Following good  walking form  by standing tall with your shoulders back and swinging your arms and practicing  conscious or nasal breathing  will help regulate your body.\n \n\n   \n  Changes in your diet, such as  reducing salt intake  and following a  Mediterranean diet , can also improve heart health and lower blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  The new study’s findings were based on data collected from 1,600 adults with a median age of 75 who were hospitalized for intracerebral hemorrhage. Participants were all admitted patients at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and were predominantly White.\n \n\n   \n  Since data was collected retrospectively, it “could be biased by the occurrence of the hemorrhage itself: people or proxies may report higher levels of alcohol consumption after a life-changing event like a cerebral hemorrhage. This could lead to biased estimates of the effect,” Elkind said. “In a true prospectively designed study, the data about alcohol consumption would be collected before the hemorrhage had occurred.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/west-virginia-national-guard-dc-deployment-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:38:00-05:00","title":"Judge to Ponder Challenge to West Virginia National Guard Deployment in the Nation’s Capital","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A court in West Virginia is set to hear arguments in a lawsuit challenging the deployment of up to 300 members of the state’s National Guard to Washington, DC, as part of President Donald Trump’s crime-fighting initiative.

November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tens of millions of Americans who  rely on the nation’s largest federal food assistance program  have been caught in a weekslong swirl of Trump administration pronouncements, court orders and anxiety since the  US government shutdown  has called their ability to buy groceries into question.\n \n\n   \n  Some recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the program formerly known as food stamps, have received their full benefits this month, while others have only received a fraction of their usual allotment, while still others  remain in limbo , uncertain if or when their payments will arrive.\n \n\n   \n  In response, a group of Democratic-led states and a coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses have launched fast-moving legal challenges seeking to restore full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The fight over food benefits has become a central flashpoint between all three branches of government during the  historically long shutdown  as one of the clearest and most tangible ways the impasse is affecting Americans’ daily lives.\n \n\n   \n  While a  bipartisan Senate deal  has emerged to fund the government through January 30 and ensure SNAP benefits through fiscal year 2026, the successful procedural vote is only a first step. The measure must still pass the full Senate and the House before heading to the president’s desk.\n \n\n   \n  At stake is critical assistance nearly 42 million people rely on to  feed themselves and their families . On average, households receive about $350 a month in benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s where things stand:\n \n\n   \n    It is unclear when all SNAP recipients will get November benefits\n \n\n   \n  It is still unclear when all recipients will receive their full allotment for November.\n \n\n   \n  Much depends on when – and whether – Congress actually approves a short-term spending package to temporarily fund federal agencies and reopen the government, and whether President Donald Trump signs it, which could take several more days to play out.\n \n\n   \n  If the deal falls through and the government remains shuttered, exactly how SNAP gets funded in the short term will continue to play out in the courts.\n \n\n   \n  At issue now is a lower court ruling ordering the US Department of Agriculture – which administers SNAP funds on the federal level – to swiftly issue full food stamp benefits to all recipients. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily halted the lower court ruling on Friday evening to allow the appeal to play out.\n \n\n   \n  Late Sunday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals declined a request by the Trump administration to block the lower court ruling, but the ruling has no immediate effect because Jackson’s temporary hold remains in place.\n \n\n   \n  Even after funding is decided and the USDA directs states to provide enrollees with their usual allotment, the timing of the benefits arriving will depend on the state: Some will be able to act immediately, while others may need more time.\n \n\n   \n    Some states have already issued partial or full benefits\n \n\n   \n  After a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the USDA to pay full SNAP benefits – and the agency issued guidance on Friday saying it was complying – several states rushed to distribute to recipients their full November allotment.\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Kansas, New York, Massachusetts, California, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington and Oregon are among the states to issue full SNAP benefits to at least some of their residents in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  Several states have said they will not seek to undo those distributions, as ordered Saturday by the USDA. The states argue they issued the full benefits before Jackson’s pause.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina, meanwhile, issued partial benefits to recipients on Friday but has halted further action in light of Jackson’s stay.\n \n\n   \n    A weekslong series of court orders put millions in benefit limbo\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of the turmoil is whether the USDA must pay full SNAP benefits without new funding from Congress and if courts can force the agency to fund the program during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the USDA said  it would not use  its roughly $5.3 billion contingency fund to provide at least partial payments for November. Full benefits for November are expected to total around $8.2 billion and other expenses push the total cost to nearly $9 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Lawsuits surfaced against the Trump administration, and on Halloween, two  federal judges rejected  the agency’s claim the contingency fund was untouchable and said the administration was required to tap into billions of those dollars to at least partially cover food stamp benefits in November.\n \n\n   \n  Days after the administration  committed to providing 50%  – and  then 65%  – of the maximum allotments at the order of a federal judge in Rhode Island, the judge then said the government must immediately pivot to  fully cover SNAP  for tens of millions of Americans because some states might not be able to send partial payments for weeks or even months.\n \n\n   \n  “People have gone without for too long,” US District Judge John McConnell said during a hastily called hearing Thursday. “Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, the Trump administration filed an appeal seeking to stay McConnell’s decision. Still, the USDA announced Friday it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with McConnell’s order.\n \n\n   \n  That evening, Jackson granted the administration’s request for a temporary pause, saying the government did not have to immediately transfer additional funds to provide full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s order does not resolve the underlying legal questions raised by the case – and the Trump administration has already committed to using the program’s contingency fund to partially pay benefits. Rather, Jackson’s administrative stay freezes any additional action by the administration to give an appeals court additional time to review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Following the justice’s order, the USDA ordered states to  stop issuing full food stamp benefits  for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments. In the  Saturday directive , the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  States failing to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over-issuances of benefits, the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly one in eight Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole and Gordon Ebanks contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:01:00-04:00","title":"A timeline of US strikes on boats that have killed 76","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States conducted 19 military strikes between September 2 and November 9, 2025, killing 76 people across the Caribbean and Pacific oceans, targeting vessels linked to designated terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and Colombian cartels.

There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, October 27.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor. The Mexican Navy conducted a search for the person, who is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n     October 29 \n \n\n   \n  The United States Armed Forces carried out an attack on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean that left four dead, Hegseth reported.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary said in a  post on X . He added that US forces suffered no casualties.\n \n\n   \n    November 1\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out  a strike on  another vessel in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n    November 4\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the US military struck another vessel “involved in illicit narcotics smuggling” in the eastern Pacific, killing two people on board.\n \n\n   \n  The US Defense secretary again posted an unclassified video of the strike  on X , noting that US forces were not harmed and the vessel was struck in international waters.\n \n\n   \n    November 6\n \n\n   \n  The US military conducted a strike against a vessel in the Caribbean, killing three people, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “The vessel was trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean and was struck in international waters,” Hegseth said in a  post on X , adding that US forces were not harmed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n    November 9\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out another attack against suspected drug boats on Sunday, killing six people in the Eastern Pacific according, to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The military launched two lethal strikes against two separate vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations,” Hegseth  wrote on X , without disclosing which organizations the ships’ crew are believed to have been affiliated with.\n \n\n   \n  “These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/democrats-voting-government-shutdown-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"08:01:00-05:00","title":"Democrats Vote with Republicans to End Government Shutdown, Agreeing on ACA Subsidy Vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan deal to end a 40-day government shutdown was secured with support from several Democratic senators and one independent, Angus King.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:01 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A group of Democrats and one Democratic-aligned independent have helped clinch an agreement to  end the government shutdown , saying they had secured a vote on the Affordable Care Act subsidies at the center of the standoff.\n \n\n   \n  The negotiators argued that Republicans’ “flat refusal” to move on Democrats’ earlier proposals made clear that “this is the best possible offer we could secure.”\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at some of those members, and their rationale for ending the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Four of them are former governors of their home states and none are up for reelection in next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois\n \n\n   \n  Durbin, a veteran member of Democratic leadership retiring at the end of his term, broke with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who opposes the deal.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Durbin said that “this bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown’s hurt.”\n \n\n   \n  He underscored the cost of the disruptions caused by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “For 40 days—the longest shutdown in U.S. history—federal workers went without paychecks. This includes our air traffic controllers, whose towers were already understaffed. They continued to work 10 hours days, six days per week to keep our airspace safe, with this additional stress at a life-saving job,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Angus King of Maine\n \n\n   \n  King, an independent, was just elected to a third term in 2024. While he caucuses with the Democrats, King has a penchant for bipartisan dealmaking and was also among the key negotiators expressing alarm about the consequences of the ongoing shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “The question was, is, as the shutdown progresses, is a solution on the ACA becoming any more likely? It appears not,” King said Sunday. “I think people are saying we’re not going to get what we want, although we still have a chance – because part of the deal is a vote on the ACA subsidies – but in the meantime, a lot of people are being hurt.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia\n \n\n   \n  Kaine was also elected to a third term in 2024. The former governor pointed to both ACA subsidies and efforts to defend the federal workforce, a key pressure point in his state, home to roughly 300,000 employees.\n \n\n   \n  “I have long said that to earn my vote, we need to be on a path toward fixing Republicans’ health care mess and to protect the federal workforce,” Kaine said in a statement about the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Kaine said the deal “guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits,” and also that it “will protect federal workers from baseless firings, reinstate those who have been wrongfully terminated during the shutdown, and ensure federal workers receive back pay.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman, elected to the Senate in 2022, has been breaking with Democrats and voting for the House-passed short-term funding resolution. He said that the shutdown “has more than run its course.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we have the votes, it’s probably going to be the minimum if it does,” he warned.\n \n\n   \n  “Our party could be overplaying its hand,” he added. “I don’t think much anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen has announced she would not seek reelection in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Sunday, Shaheen said that “waiting longer will only prolong the pain Americans are feeling because of the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be clear: This is a major step that was not predetermined. I have spent years as the lead sponsor of this legislation. There is no one in the Senate who wants to see these tax credits extended more than me. But weeks of negotiations with Republicans have made clear that they will not address health care as part of shutdown talks,” Shaheen said.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire\n \n\n   \n  Hassan, another former governor, won reelection in 2022 to her swing-state seat. She told reporters that she had been hearing from residents both affected by looming spikes in health care costs and by people affected by the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Our work to deliver relief for families now enters an important phase,” she said. “Congress has one month to engage in serious bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act’s expiring tax cuts that help people afford their health insurance.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada\n \n\n   \n  Cortez Masto also voted to end the shutdown. Her term expires in 2028.\n \n\n   \n  “Too many Americans, hardworking individuals, seniors, children were suffering,” she said at a press conference, adding that she was seeing lines at food banks that rivaled the need during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  “We can open the government and we can still fight to address this looming health care crisis,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada\n \n\n   \n  Rosen, the other Democrat from Nevada, joined her colleague in voting to end the shutdown. She was reelected last year.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, it’s become clear as we go deeper into the second month of this Republican government shutdown that President Trump and Washington Republicans are weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt,” Rosen said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What opponents are saying\n \n\n   \n  Many prominent members of the Democratic caucus opposed the deal and voiced ongoing concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m voting no on the continuing resolution that would double healthcare premiums for 20 million Americans, kick 15 million people off Medicaid & allow 50,000 Americans to die unnecessarily every year. All to give $1 trillion in tax breaks for billionaires,” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote on social media, live-streaming a speech opposing the deal.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, who is eying a 2028 presidential bid, also said he was a firm “no.”\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a phrase in Spanish, ‘Con salud, lo hay todo; sin salud, no hay nada.’ It means ‘With good health you have it all; without your health, you have nothing.’ It’s with that phrase in mind that I stand firm in my decision to vote no so that families across the country can get the health care they need,” Gallego said in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/nfl-wrap-week-10","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:52:00-04:00","title":"The week of the upset: Everything you might have missed from NFL Week 10","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NFL Week 10 delivered a mix of historic achievements, dramatic upsets, and unexpected political events.

\nUpdated: \n        9:52 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the days grow shorter and darkness comes on quicker, the  NFL  season continues with a pivotal Week 10 delivering the same madness to which fans are accustomed.\n \n\n   \n  The week was more eventful than usual, starting with the NFL trade deadline that was highlighted by the New York Jets making headlines after a shocking fire sale that saw Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams find new homes in Indianapolis and Dallas respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday got started bright and early with Jonathan Taylor leading the Colts to an overtime win over the Atlanta Falcons in Germany, which led right into multiple teams in the bottom of the standings finding a way to secure victories.\n \n\n   \n  It also saw the New England Patriots officially commandeer their spot among the league’s elite and many blowouts in the late-game slate, including an appearance from President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you may have missed on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    Colts run all over Falcons in Germany\n \n\n   \n  The NFL’s penultimate international game of the season took place at Berlin’s Olympiastadion and delivered one of the best games of the season.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor powered the Colts to a 31-25 overtime victory over the Falcons in the first regular-season NFL game in the German capital.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old rushed for 244 yards and three touchdowns, becoming just the fourth player in league history to record at least 200 rushing yards and three rushing scores in a game twice in his career, joining Jim Brown, Adrian Peterson and Derrick Henry.\n \n\n   \n  An 83-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter put the Colts ahead 22-17, but Atlanta answered with a one-yard touchdown from Tyler Allgeier to retake the lead with just over a minute left. Colts quarterback Daniel Jones then led an eight-play drive, setting up Michael Badgley’s 44-yard field goal to force overtime.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor sealed the win for Indianapolis with a walk-off eight-yard touchdown in overtime, moving the Colts to an AFC South-best 8-2 record while the Falcons dropped to 3-6.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Commanders and Miami Dolphins will close out the international slate on November 16 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.\n \n\n   \n    The week of the upset\n \n\n   \n  The Jets, New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins haven’t had much to celebrate this season.\n \n\n   \n  But on Sunday, all three teams managed to pick up a victory.\n \n\n   \n  The Jets secured their first win of the season two weeks ago against the Cincinnati Bengals and were well-rested coming off their their bye week.\n \n\n   \n  Riding that momentum, the Aaron Glenn-led squad faced the other Ohio-based team – the Cleveland Browns – and won 27-20 for their second consecutive win.\n \n\n   \n  Special teams played the hero for Gang Green, scoring touchdowns on a kickoff return and a punt return with running back Breece Hall’s 42-yard receiving touchdown to cap it all off. Both teams are now 2-7. The Jets will look for their first three-game win streak since 2023 when they face the Patriots on Thursday Night Football next week.\n \n\n   \n  Questions are swirling throughout the NFL about the futures of head coach Mike McDaniel and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa after the firing of general manager Chris Grier a week ago.\n \n\n   \n  And a tough task was on hand for the Fins, facing the Buffalo Bills – a team that Miami had lost to seven-straight time entering the game at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The Fins blew out Buffalo 30-13 to snap the losing streak to their divison rivals and easing any qualms – at least for now.\n \n\n   \n  The Saints turned to their rookie, second-round pick Tyler Shough, against division rivals Carolina Panthers and did he deliver.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old, out of Louisville, threw for 282 yards and two touchdowns in their 17-7 win to improve to 2-8 on the season.\n \n\n   \n    Patriots are back. Are they here to stay?\n \n\n   \n  Times were tough for the Patriots in the years following the departure of Tom Brady and Bill Bellichick.\n \n\n   \n  With Mike Vrabel returning to Foxborough as head coach—a place where he won multiple Super Bowls as a player—and rookie quarterback Drake Maye emerging as the franchise leader they hoped for, New England has reestablished itself among the league’s elite teams.\n \n\n   \n  The Pats marched into Tampa Bay and defeated Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers 28-23 as Maye passed for two touchdowns and rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson rushed for two more on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  After a 4-13 record last season, New England finds themselves with a 8-2 record and an AFC East division lead.\n \n\n   \n    A late-game slate filled with blowouts and the president\n \n\n   \n  All the excitement fans were presented with earlier in the day was completely wiped up by the three-game late slate, which all featured blowouts.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump became the first sitting president to attend a regular-season NFL game since President Jimmy Carter when he arrived Sunday at Northwest Stadium in Maryland for the  Washington Commanders  game against the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  While the President was met with boos, so were the Commanders as they were crushed 44-22 by the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  Sam Darnold is yet again proving why he is one of the most underrated quarterbacks in the league after leading the Seattle Seahawks to a 44-22 win over the Arizona Cardinals.\n \n\n   \n  The former first round pick 178 yards and a touchdown while defensive lineman DeMarcus Lawrence returned two fumbles for touchdowns in the win. Seahawks find themselves in a race for the NFC West division with the Los Angeles Rams, who also won Sunday in convincing fashion.\n \n\n   \n  Matt Stafford threw for four touchdowns in the team’s 42-26 win over the short-handed San Francisco 49ers.\n \n\n   \n  Both teams find themselves with a 7-2 record with seven games remaining.\n \n\n   \n  There is still one game to go in the week with the reigning Super Bowl champions Philadelphia Eagles visiting Titletown, USA, to face the Green Bay Packers on Monday Night Football.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/flight-cancellation-government-shutdown-options","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"07:29:00-05:00","title":"As flight cancellations rise, people are turning to trains, car rentals and creative solutions to get to their destinations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on a surge in flight cancellations due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which has left thousands of travelers stranded and forced to resort to rental cars, long drives, and alternative transportation.

Avis, Hertz and Turo all reported sharp increases in demand as passengers scrambled to make it to their destinations by any means necessary.\n \n\n   \n  An end to the travel woes could be in sight, with Senate lawmakers  voting on a key step  toward reopening the government Sunday night – but until then,  frustrated passengers continue to face flight delays and cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  For some like the Vegas, the disruptions have meant resorting to long drives, costly rebookings and days of uncertainty, all ripple effects of a shutdown that continues to grind the nation’s air system to a halt.\n \n\n   \n    The marathon to find their way home\n \n\n   \n  Exhausted and running on little sleep, Xavier and Soluna Vega set out on a 1,390-mile dash from Daytona Beach, Florida, to Connecticut, rushing to make it home on time for work Monday after spending $900 on a rental car – just two of countless travelers forced into marathon drives by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The nightmare began with what initially was a four-hour delay.\n \n\n   \n  “Our (Saturday) flight went from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., to 8 p.m. to 11:45 p.m., and we just felt so hopeless,” Xavier Vega told CNN from their rental car on Sunday while his partner drove.\n \n\n   \n  The couple had disembarked from a cruise in Miami with their best friend and took a train to Orlando, only to face a nearly 10-hour flight delay that ended in cancellation. The situation continued to worsen; a music festival in Orlando had wiped the city’s supply of rental cars. Desperate to get home, they managed to hop on a bus, which they nearly missed, to Daytona Beach, scrambling for Plan C.\n \n\n   \n  But when they arrived, the situation was just as bleak; not a single rental car was available. Then, by sheer chance, a break came when they least expected it.\n \n\n   \n  “We got really lucky with a gentleman who happened to drop off his rental before his flight got canceled, so we ended up really cramped in a Kia Soul,” Vega said, remarkably positive for someone who’d just pulled an eight-hour overnight drive.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t have it any other way, I just wanted to get home.”\n \n\n   \n    From backup plan to the only option\n \n\n   \n  Sean and Kelsey Fishkind were just hours away from what should have been a perfect third anniversary: a romantic night at “The Phantom of the Opera” in Baltimore. But two days ago, their celebration nearly fell apart.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the couple was en route from Boston to Washington, DC, when  their flight from their layover in New York’s LaGuardia Airport was abruptly canceled, and the next available option wasn’t until the following afternoon. But with the real possibility even that flight could be delayed or scrapped, the Fishkinds realized they’d have to find a backup plan, fast.\n \n\n   \n  At around 11 p.m., the couple says their only solution was a rental car, but finding one was easier said than done.\n \n\n   \n  According to Hertz, one-way rental bookings over the weekend surged 20% compared to the same period last year, and Turo reported a 30% jump in rentals on Friday alone.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen an increase in one-way rental activity as airlines adjust flight schedules and travelers explore alternative ways to reach their destinations,” an Avis spokesperson told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Fishkinds were among the lucky ones, managing to secure a vehicle just in time for the four-and-a-half-hour drive to DC.\n \n\n   \n  But securing a rental car was the beginning of their ordeal. The couple says Delta Air Lines had assured them they’d be reimbursed for the car rental, but after hours of frustrating calls and multiple claims, they tell CNN they’re still left with no clear answers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Delta for comment regarding the incident and car rental reimbursement in cases related to the ongoing cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  Delta said  in an earlier a statement  to customers that expense reimbursements aren’t available “for flights that are delayed or canceled due to adverse weather events or other circumstances outside of Delta’s control, including without limitation for hotels, rental cars, meals, ground transportation and other pre-paid expenses.”\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Transportation has said while airlines are  required to issue full refunds , “they will not be required to cover secondary costs,” which is the usual procedure when a cancellation or delay isn’t the carrier’s fault.\n \n\n   \n  For Sean Fishkind, a Federal Communications Commission employee furloughed due to the shutdown and without a paycheck for over 40 days, the stress is compounded.\n \n\n   \n  “From my perspective, with the impact it has on employees and the impact it has on the public, because I can’t do my job to serve the public, this is just another reminder of the more direct ways it’s starting to impact people,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It kind of feels like they’re not doing the things they need to to try to come to a resolution.”   \n \n\n   \n    Patience and kindness go a long way, travelers say\n \n\n   \n  Despite the frustration and chaos, many travelers are navigating   the shutdown’s stress with unexpected kindness.\n \n\n   \n  “We were on the appreciative side,” said Xavier Vega, a former TSA worker of 10 years who was on the front line during the 2018-2019 government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of times working for TSA, people hated us. But during the shutdown, people actually had empathy and were willing to help us,” he said. “They would give us Starbucks gift cards to get a coffee to kind of brighten up our days a little bit.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, Vega works at a group home for people with schizophrenia, many of whom lost their SNAP food aid benefits when the ongoing   shutdown froze funding from the US Department of Agriculture.   The situation remains tense. On Saturday, the US Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration  to pause full SNAP food aid benefits  for now, leaving recipients once again scrambling to make ends meet.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very difficult to tell them, ‘Hey, you might not be eating this month.’ That also added into the understanding portion of it, because I’m experiencing it as someone who has mouths to feed,” Vega said.\n \n\n   \n  He added he also worried about travelers who don’t have the same flexibility or privilege when travel plans fall apart.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m thinking, there was a gentleman in a wheelchair at the airport,” Vega said. “How is he going to get home? He’s reliant on the certainty that his flight will get there on time, that his pickup (driver) from t﻿he airport will be there at the time he says he’s going to be there.”\n \n\n   \n  For David Tilden, the shutdown turned a birthday getaway into a logistical nightmare. After an eight-hour delay at LaGuardia and a last-minute cancellation at 11 p.m., Tilden told CNN he and his wife rented a car and endured a 14-hour drive back to Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  Tilden says he thinks the crisis isn’t just about politics—it’s about a lack of basic kindness, particularly from government systems.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe in the power of kindness and tenderness and love, and I believe in the conversation, and that’s gone in Washington. It’s disgusting, it’s traumatizing, and they should all be ashamed themselves,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A fundamental failure in the United States government’\n \n\n   \n  Although travelers are trying to stay optimistic, the outlook so far remains grim.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told CNN air travel could be “reduced to a trickle” as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches and airlines continue to implement FAA-mandated reductions in flights.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines will be   required to gradually increase those cuts over the next week, with Duffy warning flight reductions  could increase to 20%  if the shutdown doesn’t end soon.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Senate convened a rare Saturday session, though senators  did not vote  and there is no deal in sight on a potential funding compromise. Majority Leader John Thune said he intends to  keep the chamber in session  until a deal is reached and the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s happening in Washington is like two kids watching their parents fight every day because they hate each other,” said Tilden, adding the shutdown and its impact on Americans is a stark contradiction to the values of American democracy and unity.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not the United States of America. This is the divided States of America. They’re hypocritical when they stand up and chant USA,” Tilden said.\n \n\n   \n  For Vega, the focus, he says, should be on the people most affected — the vulnerable, like the residents he works with who struggle with mental health issues worsened by the sudden loss of SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think whatever is being argued in Washington right now is more important than people having food on the table or being able to get from point A to point B with some level of certainty,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But if the shutdown stretches into the holidays, Vega believes it will signal a far deeper crisis beyond canceled flights.\n \n\n   \n  “At that point, there has been a fundamental failure in the United States government, and we as citizens have to speak up on that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Manu Raju and   Gordon Ebanks contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/syrias-postwar-pivot-reaches-washington-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"04:55:00-05:00","title":"Syria’s jihadist-turned-president caps extraordinary transformation with White House visit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former jihadist fighter who rose to power in January 2025 by overthrowing Syria’s 53-year Assad regime, made history by becoming the first Syrian head of state to visit the White House.

extraordinary transformation with White House visit \n       \n  Analysis by Mostafa Salem, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:55 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Less than a year after his lightning power grab, Syria’s president is capping his transformation from jihadist to global statesman in a historic visit to the White House that says as much about the young leader as it does his push for his country’s diplomatic reinvention.\n \n\n   \n  Ahmad al-Sharaa’s meeting on Monday – the first ever visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state – will be his 20th foreign trip since appointing himself as president of  Syria  in January, and his second visit to the United States, following his attendance of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.\n \n\n   \n  But this meeting will be the most high-profile and high stakes yet, a once-unthinkable encounter between the US commander-in-chief and a man who has faced American forces on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  In May, after a brief  meeting  brokered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, US President Donald Trump hailed the 43-year-old Syrian leader as a “young, attractive guy” with a “very strong past,” and ordered the lifting of some of the crippling US sanctions on Syria, a country that for decades had been firmly aligned with key American foes Russia and Iran.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the most stringent sanctions on Damascus remain and cannot be fully lifted without congressional approval. Al-Sharaa’s immediate goal in Washington is to push for their removal while urging Trump to pressure Israel to halt attacks on Syria and withdraw its troops from the south of the country.\n \n\n   \n  His broader objective, reflected in his extensive global travel, is to reverse Syria’s isolation, a legacy of the previous regime that left the country economically devasted and diplomatically shackled to a narrow axis of allies.\n \n\n   \n  Against this backdrop, the White House visit carries profound symbolic weight. Al Sharaa played basketball with top US military officials after arriving in Washington on Sunday. But in his early twenties, he encountered the US as an enemy, joining Islamist insurgents battling American forces in Iraq. Captured and later released, he crossed into Syria in 2011 and established an Al-Qaeda-backed rebel army to fight forces loyal to then-President Bashar Al Assad.\n \n\n   \n  After more than a decade of a brutal conflict against Assad’s autocratic regime, Al-Sharaa ended Syria’s long-stalemated civil war by launching a surprise offensive that swiftly toppled the 53-year Assad dynasty, an Arab relic of the Cold War.\n \n\n   \n  In their decades of power, the Assads aligned Damascus firmly with Moscow, relying on aid, arms and unwavering diplomatic backing. In Hafez al-Assad’s first full year in power in 1971, the Soviet Union established its strategic Mediterranean naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus. And it was Vladimir Putin’s decisive military intervention in 2015 that enabled Bashar al-Assad to survive the civil war.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians, who killed scores of Syrians during their campaign to keep Assad in power, continue to retain control of their military base in Tartus even after Assad’s fall. And last month, Al-Sharaa visited Moscow to meet Putin.\n \n\n   \n  As he has sought to build ties with Western nations, al-Sharaa has been careful not to antagonize Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “Engaging in a conflict with Russia right now would be too costly with Syria, nor would it be in the country’s interest,” Al-Sharaa told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview aired in October.\n \n\n   \n  Once sanctioned for terrorism by the West, the leader now appears to be on a global diplomatic charm offensive, bolstered by aggressive lobbying from regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Turkey, US allies eager to fill a power and economic vacuum left by Iran and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  For the US, Syria represents both a strategic prize and a significant risk as neighboring Lebanon spirals into instability and Iraq remains a fertile ground for Iran’s proxy militias.\n \n\n   \n  “The US is taking a large gamble on Ahmad al-Sharaa and Syria,” Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told CNN. “As (US) Ambassador (Tom) Barrack has stated numerous times, the US has no alternatives. Lebanon is a failed state according to his assessment. Iraq is deeply penetrated by pro-Iranian militias,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  And despite a clear westward outlook, the former jihadist leader remains adamant on balancing Syria’s foreign policy away from conflict in an increasingly polarized world – a policy now followed by several developing nations worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  “In this new era, one doesn’t align completely with any side. We saw that with (Sharaa’s) visit with Putin, who is an active ally with the Assad regime … and you see that with diplomacy on behalf of the Syrian government globally,” Natasha Hall, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/asia/malaysia-thailand-migrant-boat-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"03:02:00-04:00","title":"Near dozen dead in Thai-Malaysia search after Rohingya migrant boat sinks","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A migrant boat carrying Rohingya refugees sank near the Thailand-Malaysia border, resulting in 11 confirmed deaths and 13 survivors, with about 70 people believed on board.

Hadar Goldin, an Israeli soldier killed more than a decade ago in Gaza, the Prime Minister’s Office said on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin was killed in the final days of the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas and his body has been held in Gaza since then.\n \n\n   \n  “We brought Lt. Hadar Goldin - our son, a fighter - to be buried in Israel,” his father, Simcha Goldin, said in a televised statement outside their home in Kfar Saba on Sunday evening. “We do not abandon soldiers on the battlefield, because this is a value and we don’t compromise on values. Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel.”\n \n\n   \n     Following the burial ceremony in Israel on Sunday, his mother, Leah Goldin, said, “The first is the value of friendship and comradeship, the second is the right to burial in Israel, and the third is human dignity. Sadly, we faced many disappointments. We cannot give up on who we are, and we will prevail through our values.”\n \n\n   \n  Goldin’s return “provides some measure of comfort to a family that has lived with agonizing uncertainty and doubt for over 11 years,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, “I know the anguish that his family has endured. I know the pain and the solidarity that have united the entire people of Israel. And today, we are united in the knowledge that we have finally brought him back to his parents and to his family.”\n \n\n   \n  As with previous hostage returns, Hamas handed what it said was Goldin’s body to the the International Red Cross, which then transferred it to the Israeli military. The handover was part of the ceasefire agreement that brought the worst of the fighting in Gaza to an end a month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin’s family has spent years campaigning for his return, citing Israel’s commitment to the principle of leaving no one behind in conflict. The international campaign for the return of hostages taken during the Hamas-led terror attack on October 7, 2023, put a new spotlight on their fight.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin was killed on August 1, 2014, just as a ceasefire went into effect to end the conflict and just days before Israel withdrew its troops from Gaza. The Israeli military had activated the so-called Hannibal Directive, a controversial order that enables Israeli troops to take extraordinary measures to prevent a kidnapping, even at the risk of harming the abducted. Goldin’s abduction led to massive Israeli strikes in Rafah. He was 23 years old, one of 68 Israeli soldiers killed during the month-and-a-half-long war.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in that war, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire, Hamas was required to return all hostages, including the bodies of those who had been killed.\n \n\n   \n   Israeli intelligence has previously assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The return of Goldin’s body leaves four deceased hostages still in Gaza. Three are Israelis who were killed on October 7, 2023, and whose bodies were taken to Gaza. The fourth is a Thai citizen who was kidnapped during the attack. The Thai government said in May 2024 that he was presumed dead.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/style/jadeite-cabbage-taiwan-forbidden-city-curio-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"04:04:00-10:11","title":"How a humble cabbage became one of the Forbidden City’s most memorable treasures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Jadeite Cabbage, a realistic jade carving of a cabbage with insects, has become one of the most iconic and widely recognized artifacts in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan.

one of the Forbidden City’s most memorable treasures \n       \n  By Wayne Chang, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:04 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Louvre’s “Mona Lisa,” the British Museum’s Rosetta Stone, MoMA’s “Starry Night” — major museums often have one must-see item that singlehandedly draws visitors from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  For the National Palace Museum, in Taiwan’s capital Taipei, the star attraction is somewhat humbler: a cabbage.\n \n\n   \n  Carved from a block of white and green jadeite, the remarkably realistic sculpture of a Chinese cabbage glistens as if freshly picked from a field, still wet with morning dew. A katydid and locust lurk in its verdant leaves, while the unknown sculptor used the material’s natural flaws to create the illusion of ribs running along its stems.\n \n\n   \n  Resting gently on a wooden stand, the carving is just 7.4 inches tall. But it is so popular that it occupies its own exhibition hall. The museum even publicizes which dates the object will be away on “business trips” — in other words, when it is on loan or exhibited elsewhere — so visitors are not left disappointed.\n \n\n   \n  The museum does not record how many of its approximately 2 million annual visitors come specifically to view the Jadeite Cabbage. But the long line of people waiting to snap photos suggests that many, if not most, of them do. “When you see it in pictures, it doesn’t seem that vivid, but when you see it here in true light, it’s really more attractive,” said Chloe Wang, a tourist from mainland China, during a recent trip to the museum.\n \n\n   \n  The cabbage’s popularity often sees it dubbed a “national treasure” of Taiwan, although the sculpture is not officially designated as such. Its image is pasted across merchandise and turned into plush toys and replica models, in the museum store and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  The Jadeite Cabbage, like most of the National Palace Museum’s collection, is an imperial relic once housed at the Forbidden City in Beijing before being relocated to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. It is, by no means, the only one: Beijing’s Palace Museum and the Tianjin Museum, also in mainland China, both have cabbages carved from jade. In fact, the Taiwan museum itself even has two other examples.\n \n\n   \n  So why did this one, also known as “Jadeite Cabbage with Insects,” achieve global fame?\n \n\n   \n  Hsu Ya-hwei, an art history professor at National Taiwan University, said the jade’s shimmering colors and the sculptor’s technique help the piece stand out. “The craftsmanship, combined with this particular piece of the material, produced a good result,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the cabbage’s enduring popularity may also come down to its perceived symbolism. Possibly part of a dowry paid to China’s Guangxu Emperor by a consort in the 1880s, the artifact has long been associated with female purity, fertility and abundance. While some historians have questioned the long-held belief that the locust and katydid represent children — and whether the item was even a dowry gift — the idea nonetheless grabbed people’s imaginations, said Hsu.\n \n\n   \n  “The auspicious wishes contained in the artifact are quite important, and probably a key factor in its appeal to ordinary visitors,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Few historical clues\n \n\n   \n  After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Jadeite Cabbage was discovered sitting in a colorful enamel pot in the Forbidden City. It later went on show at Beijing’s Palace Museum, which was opened by China’s Republican government to display the vast imperial collection. Curators opted to present the cabbage without its pot, to make it more visually appealing, and it was an instant success with the public after﻿ debuting in 1928.\n \n\n   \n  In the 1930s, amid fears the palace collection would be seized by Japan’s Imperial Army, many of the treasures were evacuated to other cities and spent years on the road, sometimes hidden in temples and caves on the way. After Communist leader Mao Zedong triumphed in the Chinese Civil War, the fleeing Republican forces shipped thousands of crates of artifacts to Taiwan, where they established a new seat for their government.\n \n\n   \n  The Jadeite Cabbage was among the almost 700,000 items now forming the collection of Taipei’s National Palace Museum, which opened at its current location in 1965. Three years later, Taiwan’s national postal service issued a  stamp  featuring the cabbage’s image that was printed 3.5 million times, further cementing it in the public imagination.\n \n\n   \n  The cabbage is often referred to as one of the institution’s “three treasures,” along with two other popular artifacts — namely the Meat-Shaped Stone, a piece of jasper carved to resemble braised pork belly, and the Mao Kung Ting, a traditional cooking vessel featuring the longest known inscription of ancient characters on any item of Chinese bronzeware.  ﻿ The trio are often collectively described as “pickled cabbage pork hotpot” by tour guides and as a marketing gimmick.\n \n\n   \n  The everydayness of these items may also hold clues to their draw. “The familiar and endearing image of the cabbage instantly creates a connection to the imperial court, which can sometimes feel quite distant and foreign,” wrote Wang Shao-chun, a former researcher with the museum’s antiquities division, in a museum journal ﻿earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, despite the Jadeite Cabbage’s popularity among the public, some art historians and museum curators are unfazed. To trained eyes, it is of similar quality to many other realistic jade carvings, which were quite prevalent in the Qing dynasty.\n \n\n   \n  “It is one of the most unique, but not the only great piece of Chinese craftsmanship,” wrote Chang Li-tuan, a former researcher with the museum’s antiquities division, in the aforementioned﻿ museum journal.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers also say the lack of written records about the artifact — including information on who commissioned, crafted and owned it — leave the item’s historical context largely unknown.\n \n\n   \n  “There are few historical clues about the piece that allow us to talk about it in-depth,” Hsu said. “Or at least, they have not yet been found.”\n \n\n   \n  This may be why Taiwan’s Ministry of Culture has only designated the cabbage a “significant antiquity,” rather than a full-fledged National Treasure.\n \n\n   \n  “Its popularity and its historical value are clearly unproportional,” Wang told CNN. “Just like movies, a blockbuster may not necessarily be a masterpiece, and vice versa.”\n \n\n   \n  For museum curators, Wang added, the Jadeite Cabbage’s fame is a double-edged sword. “We work hard to promote other great exhibits, but sometimes the only thing on people’s minds is the cabbage. It’s kind of like a singer only remembered for that one hit song.”\n \n\n   \n    Celebrating its centennial\n \n\n   \n  The museum attaches high importance to the security of its most prized artifacts. The Jadeite Cabbage is displayed in a reinforced glass cabinet and held in place by tight strings to protect it from sudden movements — an ever-present threat in earthquake-prone Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  When it travels, it is placed in a dedicated container, which in turn is placed in a wooden box filled with protective packaging. Police and dedicated museum staff typically escort the cabbage to the airport.\n \n\n   \n  It is, however, seldom lent to overseas museums. Prior to this year, the last time the item traveled abroad was in 2014, when it (and the Meat-Shaped Stone) was exhibited in Japan. But loans can sometimes serve as tools of diplomacy. In August, as Taiwan celebrates 100 years since the Palace Museum opened, the Jadeite Cabbage was sent, along with more than 130 artifacts, to the Czech Republic, whose ties with Taiwan have warmed — as its relations with China have deteriorated — in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s ruling Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its own territory despite never having ruled over it, criticized Taipei for engaging in “separatist maneuvers” by facilitating the Czech exhibition, which is on show in the capital Prague through December 31.

planet’s newest oil frontier \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Off Brazil’s northeastern coast, where the sediment-heavy water of the vast Amazon River tips out into the Atlantic, are two very different types of treasure. The first is an ecological gem: a 3,600 square-mile  deepwater coral reef  discovered less than a decade ago. The second treasure puts the first in immediate danger. Billions of barrels of oil may lie in the ancient sediments beneath the seabed, and licenses have just been approved to drill there.\n \n\n   \n  A few hundred miles north, off the coast of Guyana, companies are already pumping around 650,000 barrels of oil a day from a huge deep-water reservoir discovered in 2015. The find has transformed this rainforest-carpeted country into the planet’s newest petrostate and highest oil producer per capita.\n \n\n   \n  Several thousand miles inland to the south, the wide, dusty plains of western Argentina’s Vaca Muerta — “dead cow” in English — are dotted with oil wells. Fossil fuel production from this enormous shale deposit has boomed over the past decade, putting it on track to produce  more than a million barrels a day  by 2030, analysts predict.\n \n\n   \n  Welcome to South America’s new oil frontier. “It’s really incredible how fast and how much it’s expanding,” said Nicole Figueiredo de Oliveira, the executive director at environmental non-profit Arayara.\n \n\n   \n  Countries across the region are ramping up extraction but Brazil, Guyana and Argentina are at the forefront —  among the top five drivers  of global oil growth outside of OPEC, the group of major oil exporters.\n \n\n   \n  They are three very different countries: an economic behemoth with an  environment-championing president , a  biodiversity hotspot  with high rates of poverty and an  economically volatile  country led by a  chainsaw-wielding climate denier . Yet they are united in their quest to expand oil production, arguing it’s vital to their economic and social development.\n \n\n   \n  This new fossil fuel boom is happening just as the impacts of the climate crisis — driven by fossil fuels — are beginning to bite in ever more alarming ways. People in South America are dying in  fires ,  floods ,  storms  and  droughts  made longer and more catastrophic by climate change.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s role as  host of the COP30 climate conference , which is supposed to be a landmark summit where countries set out goals to radically reduce planet-heating pollution, adds a particular dissonance to this oil surge.\n \n\n   \n  But as global oil demand stays strong, and other, richer, countries show few signs of scaling back, their argument is: Why shouldn’t oil supply come from South America?\n \n\n   \n  The continent has a long history of fossil fuel extraction; it holds the  second-largest reserves of oil and gas  after the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  Yet it’s one of the few regions that didn’t take advantage of the oil boom at the beginning of this century due to political riskiness and an aversion to private investment, said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University. “But that is changing very significantly,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Recent discoveries have stirred excitement, especially as the oil in South America is typically cheaper than average — deepwater sources, in particular, tend to produce large amounts at lower cost — and it also tends emit slightly lower levels of climate pollution per barrel, as it often requires less processing and is produced using newer infrastructure and cleaner energy.\n \n\n   \n  Huge oil companies including Exxon and Chevron have plowed in, seeing dollar signs in South America’s deep oceans and shale fields just as the US shale boom starts to plateau.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil is a superstar: the  region’s largest  oil and gas producer. Production has “reached levels that have never been seen in the region,” Monaldi said. This is in large part due to  ultra-deep “pre-salt” oil reserves  discovered in 2006 buried under thick layers of ancient salt beneath the ocean.\n \n\n   \n  Crude oil became the country’s top export in 2024 for the first time, overtaking soybeans, and there are hopes production will ramp up much further.\n \n\n   \n  In August, BP  announced  it had made its largest oil and gas discovery  in 25 years  off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Farther south, near Uruguay, oil companies hope the Pelotas Basin could be another new frontier.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the most controversial project is the one at the mouth of the Amazon River — the Foz do Amazonas basin — part of what’s known as the “Equatorial Margin,” a stretch of ocean along the northern coast of Brazil.\n \n\n   \n  In June, Brazil  auctioned off  several offshore oil blocks in the region, 19 of which are in the Amazon Basin, to companies including Chevron, Exxon and Brazil’s state-run oil company Petrobras.\n \n\n   \n  Petrobras has been trying to drill here for many years. In 2023, Brazil’s environmental agency IBAMA  denied  it an offshore drilling license, citing environmental concerns. But last month,   the agency gave the greenlight for exploratory drilling “after a rigorous environmental licensing process,” according to a  statement  from IBAMA.\n \n\n   \n  The agency’s task was to assess the “technical feasibility” of the project only, not the political or strategic side of oil exploitation, said a spokesperson for Brazil’s Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, which oversees IBAMA. Any process involving high-risk areas such as the Foz do Amazonas “must comply with the strictest technical, scientific, and environmental standards,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  The decision “is an achievement of Brazilian society,” said Magda Chambriard, president of Petrobras, in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  Environmental advocates are strongly opposed, arguing drilling in this ecologically delicate swath of ocean, with its unique reefs and huge stretches of mangrove forests, could bring catastrophic consequences.\n \n\n   \n  Ultra-deep water and strong currents mean any oil spill could quickly be swept across miles of ocean and coastline, and the remoteness of the drilling location from large settlements could delay clean-up operations, said Arayara’s Figueiredo de Oliveira.\n \n\n   \n  Approving drilling here mere weeks before the start of COP30 in the city of Belém — known as the gateway to the Amazon — presents tricky optics for Brazil, which is trying to walk a tightrope between environmental champion and fossil fuel power.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s mighty rivers and abundant rains mean  most of its electricity  comes from clean hydroelectric power. Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has presided over a  sharp decline in deforestation  and an increase in renewables.\n \n\n   \n  But Lula has always been pro-oil, Figueiredo de Oliveira said. He greeted Brazil’s big pre-salt discovery, made during his previous presidential term, with the words, “ God is Brazilian .” A famous photo shows him raising oil-drenched hands at a Petrobras event in 2010.\n \n\n   \n  Lula has firmly rejected claims of hypocrisy. “I don’t want to be an environmental leader. I never claimed to be,” he  said  at a COP30 meeting last week, adding it would be “irresponsible,” to quit oil.\n \n\n   \n  He argues oil wealth can help fund Brazil’s clean energy transition, although some fear the quest to become a major oil power will only delay it. “Every new discovery does set back the effort to move the world off fossil fuels; there’s a loss of momentum,” said Michael Ross, a political science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps Lula’s main narrative  is that oil revenues will provide a route to development and a pathway out of poverty, especially for the country’s poorer Amazon states. But Brazil is already a powerhouse “with many other economic opportunities,” Ross told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The argument oil is vital for development may be easier to make in a country like Guyana, where  around 48%  live on less than $5.50 a day, according to the World Bank.\n \n\n   \n  Guyana, which has a similar geology to Brazil’s Equatorial Margin, is experiencing a remarkable oil boom. The 2015 offshore   discovery “represents one of the most transformative milestones” in the country’s modern history, said President Irfaan Ali.\n \n\n   \n  It has transformed the nation of around 820,000 people into the  world’s fastest expanding economy . “We have never seen a country produce so many barrels per capita in the history of (the region)… they belong now in the category of the countries of the Middle East,” Monaldi said.\n \n\n   \n  The government has insisted it can balance oil exploitation with environmental priorities. Guyana is one of the few countries that stores more planet-heating pollution than it produces due to its vast rainforests. It also says that revenues will boost socioeconomic growth.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not see a contradiction between the responsible development of our oil and gas sector and our commitment to protecting the planet’s climate,” Ali told CNN. Both are “integral parts of a single national mission” to cut poverty, boost the economy and protect the environment, he said.\n \n\n   \n  But there are concerns Guyana could fall victim to the “resource curse,” in which huge windfalls can make life worse for those who live there. Venezuela, for example, holds the world’s largest proven oil reserves, and has descended into authoritarianism and economic crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Ali insists the resource curse “is not destiny” and oil wealth will translate into “benefits for every household.” Yet some residents say they face  sky- high living costs  they blame on oil development, and the country’s health outcomes remain below the regional average, according to the World Bank.\n \n\n   \n  South American oil is not just about deep water. Argentina’s huge shale region, Vaca Muerta, often compared to the Permian Basin in Texas, holds the world’s second largest reserves of shale gas and fourth largest of shale oil.\n \n\n   \n  It’s Argentina’s big hope for economic recovery under libertarian President Javier Milei. “Almost everything is about expanding Vaca Muerta,” said Gabriel Blanco, a professor in the Faculty of Engineering at the National University of Central Buenos Aires and former national director of climate change in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Oil and gas are a very easy sell domestically, Blanco told CNN. Climate change has “never ever” been on the public or political agenda, he said. Instead, “the narrative says that we are going to be rich and we’re going to develop.”\n \n\n   \n  Vaca Muerta is an attractive proposition for fossil fuel companies. Shale is a very different type of investment than deep-water drilling, Monaldi said. Companies can spend relatively small amounts to see if they can recover their money before putting in more. This encourages investment in Argentina, a country with “high political and regulatory risk,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But environmental experts fear the impacts of this booming shale field. Fossil fuels are extracted by “fracking,” a process that involves drilling into the Earth and injecting fluids at high pressure. “They use a lot of water, they use a lot of sand and chemicals, and so it’s a mess,” Blanco said.\n \n\n   \n  Exactly how South America’s oil future will unfold is not yet clear. New discoveries in Brazil may turn out to be less viable than hoped. For projects already drilling and pumping, reserves often run out earlier than anticipated, UCLA’s Ross said.\n \n\n   \n  Oil demand is also predicted to peak at the start of the next decade, which could mean countries that go hard on fossil fuels will find themselves locked into an unprofitable industry. “These countries are getting to the party right as the bar is closing,” Ross said.\n \n\n   \n  For now, however, demand remains. “While there’s still a gap between current production and demand, there will be investment into new projects,” said Flávio Ferreira Menten, an analyst at the research firm Rystad Energy.\n \n\n   \n  There are geopolitical considerations, too. If US oil production doesn’t keep growing, South America “becomes much more important,” Monaldi said, otherwise the world risks becoming reliant on countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  What’s happening in South America is reflective of something bigger, according to Blanco. The region’s love affair with fossil fuels is part of a global movement, he said: an implicit — and sometimes explicit — consensus that oil exploitation can and should continue for decades to come even in the face of a barreling climate crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like leaders decided to step strongly on the on the gas pedal and move forward with fossil fuels everywhere,” he said, “no matter what.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/asia/philippines-typhoon-fung-wong-uwan-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-05:00","title":"More than 1.4 million evacuated as second typhoon in a week slams into the Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan, struck the Philippines with powerful winds and extreme rainfall, killing at least four people, including two children, and displacing over 1.4 million residents.

triggered floods and landslides, cut power to entire provinces and killed at least ﻿four people, including two children, before barreling out of the Philippines on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan,   follows on the heels of  Typhoon Kalmaegi , which killed almost 200 people in the central part of the archipelago nation, as well as five people in Vietnam.    \n \n\n   \n  About 1.4 million people were evacuated ahead the typhoon making landfall on Sunday night, according to the Office of Civil Defense. Fung-wong slammed into the coastal municipality of Dinalungan, on the main island of Luzon, with sustained winds of up to 185 kph (115 mph) and gusts of up to 230 kph (143 mph).\n \n\n   \n  A mudslide buried a house and killed two children in the town of Kayapa in central Luzon, regional civil defense official Alvin Ayson told Reuters news agency Monday.\n \n\n   \n  They followed the deaths of   two people  —  one who   drowned in Catanduanes province and a woman who died after being trapped under the debris of a collapsed home in Catbalogan City, according to the civil defense.\n \n\n   \n  The storm, with a footprint that spanned nearly the entirety of the archipelago, lost strength as it swept through mountainous northern provinces and agricultural plains overnight, before heading into the South China Sea toward Taiwan, according to the Philippines’ weather agency PAGASA.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan is now bracing for Fung-wong, with school closures announced in parts of the eastern county of Hualien, and evacuation orders issued in flood and landslide-prone areas, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Dramatic video from the Philippines showed rescuers braving strong winds and homes submerged in water as recovery efforts continued overnight into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Drone footage from Reuters showed vast areas of flooded farmlands in Nueva Ecija province, while other videos showed massive waves crashing into the Catanduanes coastline, flooded streets, and water surging into a building in Aurora province, while families queued for food in shelters.\n \n\n   \n  About 1.4 million residents took emergency shelter at gymnasiums, theaters and relatives’ homes before the typhoon hit, with 318,000 remaining in evacuation centers on Monday, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “We could not sleep because of the winds hitting our metal sheets and tree branches falling,” Romeo Mariano, who sheltered with his grandmother at home in Isabela province, told Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  “When we got out to check our home, we saw the damage.”\n \n\n   \n  Filomina Mariano, a 69-year-old resident in Santiago City told Reuters: “I was not able to sleep last night. I told my grandchildren to pray for our safety. I was just sitting the whole night waiting for the storm to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  Around 1,000 houses were damaged in the storm, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) said, adding that some homes remain blocked by landslides and rescuers are working to reach them once conditions improve Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “While the typhoon has passed, its rains still pose a danger in certain areas in northern Luzon, including in metropolitan Manila,” Alejandro said. “We’ll undertake today rescue, relief and disaster-response operations.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 130 northern villages were flooded, with residents in at least one community trapped on their roofs as floodwaters rapidly rose, according to the Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  “People are a little shellshocked,” Butch Meily, president of the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF), told CNN, noting this marks the country’s fourth major typhoon, in addition to  two earthquakes , within the past seven weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Recovery efforts were interrupted in Kalmaegi-stricken Cebu and Davao to the south ﻿ , to concentrate all available resources on Fung-wong, including a 24-hour operation center near the capital Manila, said Meily of the PDRF, a major private-sector coordinator for disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  “But our funds are starting to get exhausted because of the number of emergencies,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  At its height, the typhoon’s massive circulation spanned 1,800 km — enough to cover the entire country, PAGASA weather specialist Benison Estareja told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared a state of emergency on Thursday due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected damage from Fung-wong.\n \n\n   \n  More than 325 domestic and 61 international flights were canceled over the weekend and into Monday, and more than 6,600 commuters and cargo workers were stranded in ports after the coast guard prohibited ships from venturing into rough seas, AP reported. About 3 million people were left without power on Sunday, according to Philippines News Agency.\n \n\n   \n  While the Philippines has not requested international aid after Kalmaegi, officials said the US and Japan are prepared to assist, and authorities have ordered schools and most government offices to close until Wednesday, according to AP.\n \n\n   \n    No pause for relief\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is no stranger to typhoons, and Fung-wong is the 21st named storm to impact the country this year, according to local officials.\n \n\n   \n  Its predecessor Kalmaegi left a trail of death and devastation as it tore through the central Philippines on Tuesday, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble and displacing tens of thousands of people. At least 188 people were killed, most in Cebu province, a tourist hotspot, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  Though not the strongest storm to hit the country this year, Kalmaegi was slow-moving and dumped huge volumes of water over highly populated areas. Officials said most people died from drowning.\n \n\n   \n  Its impact was worsened by clogged waterways in an already flood-prone area, and an apparent lack of understanding of early warnings, Alejandro of the Office of Civil Defense, told local media.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is one of Asia’s most flood-prone countries but this year it has also been mired in a massive corruption scandal involving flood control projects that have brought thousands of protesters onto the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of legislators, senators and construction companies have been accused of receiving kickbacks with money intended for thousands of flood control projects.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have  long warned  the human-caused climate crisis – for which industrialized nations bear greater historical responsibility – has only exacerbated the scale and intensity of regional storms that disproportionately impact populations in the Global South.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is one area where the weather is changing, with more intense storms and severe tropical storms with a wide rain band, Meily said.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past, we used to focus on where the storm would make landfall. But now we have to consider the rain band because it’s so wide in scope that areas far away from where the storm makes land are getting flooded.”\n \n\n   \n  The western Pacific is the most active tropical basin on Earth but global ocean temperatures have been at record levels for each of the last eight years.\n \n\n   \n  Hotter oceans, fueled by  human-caused global warming , provide ample energy for storms to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  The climate crisis is supercharging rainfall events as warmer air can hold more moisture, which it then wrings out over towns, cities and communities, as it already has this week in Southeast Asia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/asia/south-korea-yoon-suk-yeol-charges-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:14:00-05:00","title":"South Korea Special Prosecutor Indicts Former President Yoon on Charges of Aiding an Enemy State","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korea's special prosecutor has indicted former President Yoon Suk Yeol, former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, and former military intelligence chief Yeo In-hyung on new charges of abusing power and aiding an enemy state.

one of Russia’s largest attacks on energy infrastructure \n       \n  By Daria Tarasova-Markina and Tim Lister, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:20 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Millions of Ukrainians are enduring cold temperatures and darkness after a wave of Russian attacks against energy facilities caused widespread power outages across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian authorities have warned that the large scale of the damage means it will take time to restore energy flows. Electricity supplies across the country are being rationed – with people in the capital Kyiv set to be without power for 10-12 hours on Sunday, according to schedules published by energy companies.\n \n\n   \n  Svitlana Grynchuk, Ukraine’s energy minister, said the attack on Saturday was “one of the largest direct ballistic attacks on energy facilities” since the start of the war.\n \n\n   \n  She said that emergency power cuts were implemented across almost all regions to stabilise the network. “We then switched to hourly power cuts, so that consumers could more easily plan their activities around the outages,” Grynchuk said.\n \n\n   \n  The attack over the weekend came just as temperatures in Ukraine began to drop to single digits degrees Celsius. Russia has targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure on numerous occasions since it launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, usually stepping up attacks around this time of the year.\n \n\n   \n  These frequent disruptions have forced Ukrainians to adapt – diesel generators have become a common sight across the country and people have become accustomed to scheduling their lives around planned outages.\n \n\n   \n  Many families are now scheduling cooking and homework time around the power schedules, and elderly people not leaving their homes in fear of getting stuck without an access to the lift.\n \n\n   \n    Russia strikes when people are asleep\n \n\n   \n  Nine Ukrainian regions came under attack overnight into Saturday, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n \n\n   \n  At least 15 civilians have been killed by Russian strikes over the weekend, according to Ukrainian local authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed and 12 injured when a Russian drone struck a nine-story apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro.  Video captured  the moment the drone struck in the darkness.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s nothing here, just ordinary buildings,” said a woman who gave her name as Maia.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how I survived, because all the shrapnel flew onto the bed where I was sleeping,” said Larysa, another resident of the building.\n \n\n   \n  “We gathered quickly and started to go downstairs. People were screaming. You could already hear screams from the street,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Of the 45 missiles fired by Russia overnight Saturday, some of which were ballistic weapons, the Ukrainian air force said only nine had been intercepted. Some 450 drones were also launched.\n \n\n   \n  “26 missiles and 52 strike UAVs (drones) have been recorded hitting 25 locations,” it said, with many of the attacks occurring in the central regions of Poltava and Dnipropetrovsk as well as Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  “It is extremely difficult to counter ballistic and aero-ballistic missiles,” Zelensky said in his daily address later Saturday. “Only a few systems in the world are capable of intercepting such missiles effectively – and to protect our entire territory, we need far more of these systems and far more of the missiles for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian president said Kyiv was working with the US to purchase additional Patriot air defense systems, which have proved capable in intercepting Russian missiles.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has requested more help from allies to replenish its air defenses, as well as longer-range missiles to attack Russian energy and military facilities. Its request for US Tomahawk missiles was turned down by President Donald Trump last month.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s defense ministry said the strikes had come in response to Ukrainian attacks, and had included Kinzhal ballistic missiles and other weapons in strikes against “enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex and gas and energy facilities of Ukraine that supported their operations.”\n \n\n   \n  The frequent attacks on energy have seriously damaged Ukrainian gas production. Ukrainian officials have said they’ll have to turn to expensive imports of European gas to make up the shortfall.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the enemy’s plans, Ukraine will have light and heat this winter,” said energy minister Grynchuk.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian military and security services  have also stepped up  drone and missile attacks against Russian refineries and other infrastructure such as pipelines and pumping stations in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, Ukrainian drones carried out what one Russian official described as a “massive attack” on energy facilities in the Volgograd region, a frequent target of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  A substation was hit, according to Andrey Bocharov, the regional governor, who said power was restored several hours after the strike.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/democratic-unity-fractures-government-reopen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Democratic unity fractures, paving the way for the government to reopen","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After 40 days of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, a bipartisan compromise reached in the Senate ended the crisis by reopening federal operations through January 30, 2026.

fractures, paving the way for the government to reopen \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:05 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Enough Democrats caved.\n \n\n   \n  A Sunday night Senate deal may be on the verge of resolving the longest government shutdown on record — after a group of moderate Democrats dropped their key demand — a guaranteed extension of Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement opened the way for a Senate vote in which eight Democratic defectors  voted to break the filibuster  and to clear the first hurdle to reopening the government after nearly six weeks. Their move will offer relief to millions of Americans whose lives have been severely disrupted by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But the compromise was opposed by some key party leaders and is already igniting a firestorm of protests from progressives who accuse their more moderate colleagues of disastrously backing down, handing President Donald Trump a victory and turning their backs on millions of Americans who can’t afford  spiking health care premiums .  \n \n\n   \n  “I will not support a deal that does nothing to make health care more affordable,” Democratic Sen Elizabeth Warren, a leading progressive, wrote on X. “We are in a health care emergency. … A vote for this bill is a mistake.”\n \n\n   \n  It might be crass to parse the human misery caused by the shutdown for a partisan win after a political duel that deprived millions of Americans of  food benefits , left federal workers with $0 paychecks, and created chaos and safety fears in  commercial aviation .\n \n\n   \n  But the crisis — precipitated by the expiration of enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans,  whose prices are skyrocketing  — was fought for multilayered political reasons. It will influence judgments on Trump’s second presidency and the Republican majorities in Congress and help define the trajectory of the Democratic Party’s comeback bid ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  The deal sets a date for a vote in the Senate on ACA subsidies in December, but falls well short of cementing their extension. It funds the government through January 30 and guarantees pay for federal workers furloughed during the shutdown and those who worked without pay. It also reverses Trump’s firing of federal employees throughout the impasse and funds  food stamps  through 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Once the package works through procedural steps in the Senate, the Republican-led House must be recalled to vote on the measure.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘political disaster’\n \n\n   \n  The headline here is that sufficient numbers of Democrats are folding without achieving the goal that led them to withhold votes from a government funding bill and halt federal operations at the beginning of October.\n \n\n   \n  On the face of it, this looks like a massive failure. Democrats won no undertaking that Obamacare subsidies will be extended — despite insisting that such a move was their bottom line. The best they will get is a Senate vote. There is no guarantee that a bill extending subsidies will pass, considering the Senate’s GOP majority. And the prospects of the Republican House endorsing it seem even more remote.\n \n\n   \n  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive leader who sits as an independent but votes with Democrats, said the compromise risked “a policy and political disaster.” He added before the Senate vote: “My own thought is that it would be a horrific mistake to cave in to Trump right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Many leading Democrats  argued their party’s big wins  in elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City last week were attributable to the effective way their candidates lacerated Trump over  the cost of living .\n \n\n   \n  Now, at the first chance they got to put that lesson into practice — fighting for the affordability of health care — they gave up, even though polls showed most  voters blame Trump  for the shutdown and agree with the Democratic position.\n \n\n   \n  The blowback could be severe, exposing deep divisions in the party that may show the “big tent” that leaders kept citing in the aftermath of last week’s election victories may be more viable in theory than in practice.\n \n\n   \n  There were many unhappy Democrats inside and outside the Senate. Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego warned he would not turn his back on Americans seeing their premiums sharply rise as he voted no on the resolution. “At a time when prices are already too high, Americans are shopping for health insurance and experiencing such sticker shock that they are being forced to sign up for a crappy, overpriced plan or not signing up for insurance at all,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer, did not vote for the deal. But Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the party’s No. 2 leader in the chamber, who is retiring next year and is therefore shielded from a left-wing backlash, supported it.\n \n\n   \n  Another Democrat who voted for the deal, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, represents thousands of federal workers and welcomed the move to reverse firings during the shutdown. He also argued that the Senate vote on extending the enhanced subsidies would put the GOP on the spot. “Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don’t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,” Kaine said.\n \n\n   \n    A more pragmatic view of the Democratic concessions\n \n\n   \n  Still, assessments of the break in the deadlock that came on Day 40 of the shutdown must also factor in whether the Democrats’ demand was achievable in the first place and whether the deepening pain of the shutdown, which is fast becoming a national crisis, was about to make their position unsustainable.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat who opposed the shutdown all along, warned his party might overplay its hand by carrying on. “I don’t think much anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval,” Fetterman told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders, dealing with intense fury over Trump’s bulldozing presidency among their base, and disillusionment over the party’s disastrous 2024 election loss, had no real political option but to fight — even if it was obvious that securing an extension to Obamacare subsidies might be unattainable.\n \n\n   \n  The party may accrue some political benefits for forcing Trump into the longest-ever shutdown. Multiple polls showed more Americans blamed him and his party at a time when his  approval ratings  are dipping into the kind of steep slump second-term presidents struggle to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the shutdown, Trump, a billionaire surrounded by a Cabinet of millionaires and billionaires, seemed indifferent to the daily struggles of millions of Americans. It was easy for Democrats to portray him as cruel as his administration fought court orders to restore funding to food assistance for 42 million Americans. While Trump is pledging to talk more about affordability, that is an impression that might stick.\n \n\n   \n  And there is an unpalatable truth that some progressives prefer not to contemplate. Democrats have almost no power in Washington. They’ve used their only leverage — the capacity to withhold their votes in the Senate, where 60 votes are required for most legislation — to frustrate a president who gets almost no pushback. That’s not nothing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump seemed quite willing to allow the pain and anxiety of the shutdown to deepen for millions of Americans. He was implicitly daring Democrats to pick the suffering of one set of millions of Americans over the duress being experienced by millions more. With the president refusing to negotiate, it was incumbent on Democrats to consider whether the cost of carrying on was justified.\n \n\n   \n  Progressives are already dismayed about what many will see as a humiliating climbdown by Senate moderates. But another lesson from Democratic wins in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races last week was that moderate candidates racked up big victory margins. A pragmatic view of the shutdown as it stood on Sunday was that as the fast-worsening consequences became clear — with Thanksgiving travel chaos looming — Democrats may have risked losing their incremental political gains if public opinion swung against them as well as the GOP.\n \n\n   \n  In that sense, the classic building of pressure that historically ends up forcing the reopening of the government — namely that political damage caused by carrying on is outweighed by the advantage of staying shut down — did its work again, albeit belatedly.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, it’s become clear as we go deeper into the second month of this Republican government shutdown that President Trump and Washington Republicans are weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt,” Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said in a statement after voting to support the compromise deal.\n \n\n   \n  But whatever the recriminations, there’s no doubt Democrats succeeded in highlighting a core issue — the exploding cost of health care — which the GOP seems to have no viable plan to tackle.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown has not changed this issue: The health care system is broken, people may lose insurance, and Republicans may end up with the blame if they don’t fix it, since they are the party in power.\n \n\n   \n    Trump didn’t cave, but he may have badly damaged his brand anyway\n \n\n   \n  Given the exhausting pace of the Trump presidency, and the multiple controversies unfolding at once under the chaos agent in the White House, it seems unlikely a shutdown now will play a major role in influencing the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Trump may have gotten what he wanted.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout his presidency, business career and life, Trump has always tried to impose personal leverage. His self-image as a winner who doesn’t give into pressure will exit the shutdown intact. Trump was determined not bend to Democrats employing the kind of hardline tactics he so often uses himself. And he didn’t. The president warned that he wouldn’t negotiate on health care with the government closed. And he held firm.\n \n\n   \n  But the political cost wrought by his actions over the last 40 days could be considerable. He often looked callous, as though unconcerned about the real pain inflicted by the shutdown. After all, he went to the Supreme Court to try to overturn a court order requiring him to pay food stamp benefits. And when the deal was struck in the Senate on Sunday night, he was absent — after attending a Washington Commanders NFL game and spending the weekend at his luxury resort in Florida, reinforcing an impression he doesn’t care about the economic concerns of regular Americans.\n \n\n   \n  And Republicans are still not off the hook on the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. GOP leaders now face the question of whether they are willing to let them expire, in a scenario that could put health care out of reach for millions of people. This seems an unsustainable political position in the run-up to midterm elections, and the issue is set to only gain in traction as the end of the year looms.\n \n\n   \n  And bitter divisions in the GOP — most graphically exemplified during the shutdown by  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene , with her scathing criticism of her party’s dearth of ideas on health care — are likely to burst open when the House returns from its weekslong absence, and will again test the authority of Speaker Mike Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown drama also revealed rare signs that Trump’s authority over his own party isn’t absolute on Capitol Hill. Republican senators ignored his demands to  abolish the filibuster  that requires most bills to get 60 votes in the chamber. Such a move would have given Trump almost unlimited power to use GOP majorities to transform the nation over the next year.\n \n\n   \n  But GOP senators feared what any Democratic majority might do in the absence of the filibuster. Their position was a nod to a future in which Trump is not the dominant GOP figure, underscoring that lame-duck status may beckon even for a president who has shattered almost every convention of his office.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/us/coal-mine-flood-accident-west-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"19:28:00-05:00","title":"Flood Traps Coal Miner in West Virginia Mine","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A flood in the Rolling Thunder coal mine near Drennen, West Virginia, has trapped a coal miner after an old mine wall was compromised, prompting emergency responders to deploy an underwater drone to locate and rescue the individual.

during his 17 years as  commissioner  but was criticized for not taking stronger action on concussions, died Sunday from heart failure at 84 years old.\n \n\n   \n  NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Tagliabue’s family informed the league of his death in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue, who had developed Parkinson’s disease, was commissioner after Pete Rozelle from 1989 to 2006. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of a special centennial class in 2020. Current Commissioner Roger Goodell succeeded Tagliabue.\n \n\n   \n  “Paul was the ultimate steward of the game — tall in stature, humble in presence and decisive in his loyalty to the NFL,” Goodell said in a statement. “I am forever grateful and proud to have Paul as my friend and mentor. I cherished the innumerable hours we spent together where he helped shape me as an executive but also as a man, husband and father.”\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue oversaw a myriad of new stadiums and negotiated television contracts that added billions of dollars to the league’s bank account. Under him, there were no labor stoppages.\n \n\n   \n  During his time, Los Angeles lost two teams and Cleveland another, migrating to Baltimore before being replaced by an expansion franchise.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue implemented a policy on substance abuse that was considered the strongest in all major sports. He also established the “Rooney Rule,” in which all teams with coaching vacancies must interview minority candidates. It has since been expanded to include front-office and league executive positions.\n \n\n   \n  When he took office in 1989, the NFL had just gotten its first Black head coach of the modern era.

The issue has plagued the NFL for decades, though team owners had a major role in the lack of progress in dealing with head trauma.\n \n\n   \n  In 2017, Tagliabue apologized for remarks he made decades ago about concussions in football, acknowledging he didn’t have the proper data at the time in 1994. He called concussions “one of those pack-journalism issues” and contended the number of concussions “is relatively small; the problem is the journalist issue.”\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously,” he said on Talk of Fame Network, “I do regret those remarks. Looking back, it was not sensible language to use to express my thoughts at the time. My language was intemperate, and it led to serious misunderstanding. I overreacted on issues which we were already working on. But that doesn’t excuse the overreaction and intemperate language.\n \n\n   \n  “Bottom line, it sounded like I was shooting the messenger, which was the concussion issue. My intention at the time was to make a point which could have been made fairly simply: that there was a need for better data. There was a need for more reliable information about concussions and uniformity in terms of how they were being defined in terms of severity.”\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue is survived by his wife Chandler, son Drew, and daughter Emily.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/government-shutdown-reopen-deal-senate","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"11:57:00-04:00","title":"Senate Advances Deal to Reopen Government After Centrist Democrats Strike Major Deal to End Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate advanced a bipartisan funding deal to end a 40-day government shutdown, with eight centrist Democratic senators supporting a compromise that includes a stopgap funding measure through January 30 and a future vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies.

government after centrist Democrats strike major deal to end shutdown \n       \n  By Manu Raju, Ted  Barrett, Alison Main, Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:57 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A critical bloc of eight Senate Democratic centrists on Sunday helped advance a funding deal to reopen the government in exchange for a future vote on extending  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies , putting Congress on a path to end the  longest shutdown in US history  within days.\n \n\n   \n  That deal would include a new stopgap measure to extend government funding until January and be tied to a larger package to fully fund several key agencies. It includes no guarantee from Republicans to extend the health care subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  What Democrats did secure is a future vote on the matter. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on the chamber floor Sunday that he will hold a vote on a measure to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits by the middle of next month. Democrats involved in the talks believe that will give enough time for House and Senate GOP leaders to negotiate a true compromise in the coming weeks, though it would be a major lift to get through a Republican-controlled Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the outrage from the rest of the Senate Democratic Caucus, GOP leaders are determined to move the funding measure quickly through Congress and to President Donald Trump’s desk in the coming days. Once Trump has signed it into law, it’s still not clear how quickly agencies can restore services for the tens of millions of Americans  facing shutdown pain , from the loss of federal food aid to child care closures to delayed paychecks. Senate GOP leaders have not yet scheduled a final passage vote.\n \n\n   \n  “I am optimistic that after almost six weeks of this shutdown, we’ll finally be able to end it,” Thune declared from the Senate floor on Day 40 of the funding lapse.\n \n\n   \n  An exasperated Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado voted no on the deal but argued that his colleagues who supported it did not “cave” and instead were doing “what they feel is helping the most number of people.”\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no good solution,” Hickenlooper said, adding that some of his colleagues believe Trump will “stop at nothing to prevent that subsidy from being restored.” He added: “I voted no just because … piss off, I’m just frustrated. We tried it and now we’re going to use every other tool. We’re not going to quit.”\n \n\n   \n  Once the Senate has given final approval to the funding measure, it heads to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson must muscle the deal through a fractious GOP conference — likely with help from Trump himself. It’s not yet clear how many House Democrats will help Johnson with that job.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government say Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending the Obamacare subsidies forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  They believe that Democrats have an upper hand on the issue of health care and that a separate health care vote will spotlight the differences between the two parties, even though it has little chance of becoming law. And they’re not ruling out another shutdown showdown in January, when the next tranche of funding expires (though critical programs such as food aid and WIC will already be funded, to lessen the pain for millions of Americans).\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a retiring Democrat from New Hampshire, said Republicans made clear repeatedly over recent months that “this was the only deal on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  “Now I understand that not all of my Democratic colleagues are satisfied with this agreement, but waiting another week or another month wouldn’t deliver a better outcome.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether Democrats would willing to vote down the next funding measure on January 30 if Congress fails to deliver a health care fix by then, Shaheen said: “That’s certainly an option that everybody will consider.”\n \n\n   \n  The deal, which has been in the works for the last five weeks, came together between three former governors — Shaheen of New Hampshire, Angus King of Maine and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire — along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House. Details of the deal were first reported by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One of those Democrats involved is Sen. Tim Kaine, who represents thousands of federal workers in Virginia and who said he supports the GOP’s promise for a future vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don’t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,” Kaine said of GOP senators who choose not to support extending the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  And importantly for Kaine, Democrats also secured an agreement from the White House to reverse its mass firings of federal workers during the shutdown, as well as protections against them happening the rest of this fiscal year. It also guarantees all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But inside the Democratic Party, the funding deal has exposed a deep divide. Liberal senators were fuming at their colleagues for backing the deal, with House Democratic leaders vowing to “fight” the deal in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democratic leadership was split on the vote, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opposing the deal while his No. 2, retiring Sen. Dick Durbin, supported it.\n \n\n   \n  But some liberal senators have fiercely opposed the plan, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s no deal without health care,” Blumenthal said, voicing a widespread sentiment in the Democratic caucus. “So far as I’m concerned, health care isn’t included, and so I’ll be a no.”\n \n\n   \n  Even some centrist-leaning Democrats, like Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, voiced concerns with the idea on Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  “I was involved for many weeks, and then over the last couple of weeks, it changed — last week it changed,” Slotkin said, noting that she was no longer involved in talks in recent days. “But I always said, like, it’s got to do something concrete on health care, and it’s hard to see how that happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Across the Capitol, House Democratic leaders sharply condemned the deal. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his caucus “will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” adding: “We will fight the GOP bill in the House of Representatives.”\n \n\n   \n  One member, Rep. Ro Khanna of California,  took to X  on Sunday night calling for Schumer to be replaced. “Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced. If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?” Khanna wrote.\n \n\n   \n  House Democrats plan to have their own caucus huddle on Monday, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture. That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The next step after Sunday night’s vote is a vote on the full measure, which includes the larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate would first vote to take up the House-passed stopgap measure, which means eight Democrats would need to support it for it to advance. Then, the Senate would amend that bill with the larger funding package negotiated between the two parties.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, who has voted on the GOP funding plan throughout the shutdown and criticized his own party’s stance, said Sunday that it is time to ”take the win.”\n \n\n   \n  Vote yes, he said, “and then we can find a way to lower our costs about health care.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/usda-pauses-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:07:00-05:00","title":"USDA Orders States to Stop Issuing Full SNAP Benefits and to ‘Undo’ Benefits Sent for November","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ordered all states to halt the issuance of full SNAP benefits for November 2025 and to reverse any prior full allocations, citing a temporary Supreme Court pause of a lower court order that required full payments.

8:07 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture ordered states to stop issuing full food stamp benefits for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments, after a Supreme Court justice on Friday paused a lower court order requiring the agency to pay Americans their full assistance.\n \n\n   \n  In the  Saturday directive , obtained by CNN, the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits — which will provide 65% of the maximum allotments for November — as ordered by the same lower court judge earlier in the week. (Many recipients will receive  less than 65% of their usual assistance  because of the way food stamp benefits are calculated.)\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  States that fail to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over issuances of benefits, the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly 1 in 8 Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program. Over the past week, the USDA has issued guidance multiple times as lawsuits over the agency’s decision not to tap into a contingency fund to pay November benefits have worked their way through federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  The latest guidance follows   a memorandum  from the department on Friday saying it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal lower court order, and that the process should be completed later that day.\n \n\n   \n  Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Friday that residents who should have already gotten their SNAP benefits this month will start getting their full payments on Friday. The next day, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that residents who received their benefits are able to spend them, but the state has paused issuing full allocations to additional people.\n \n\n   \n  Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that there’s “no clarity at all” in the guidance and that the administration is causing “intentional chaos.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once we decided to step up and say we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK … we’ve now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money,” Moore said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n \n\n   \n    Legal battles\n \n\n   \n  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday evening temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover  full food stamp benefits , siding with the administration on a short-term basis in a legal fight that has quickly become a defining confrontation of the  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The ruling meant the USDA does not have to immediately honor a lower court order that required it to transfer $4 billion to the key food assistance program.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s ruling followed one a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island that directed the agency to make the full payments, reversing his own order from earlier in the month requiring the USDA to tap into its $5.3 billion contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits for the month.\n \n\n   \n  His more expansive ruling mandated the agency shift tariff revenue meant for child nutrition programs to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in appropriations for the government.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling in recent weeks that the agency must at least pay partial benefits or, at its discretion, provide recipients with their full allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The agency opted to provide partial payments — first saying states could issue 50% of the maximum benefit and then revising the figure to 65%. But the USDA warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell last week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\n \n\n   \n    Providing full benefits\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards, according to the Department of Justice’s filing to the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to the USDA’s demand that states should undo any steps taken to issue full benefits, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said on Sunday, “No.”\n \n\n   \n  The state loaded November benefits onto the cards of nearly 700,000 residents on Friday prior to the Supreme Court’s pause, he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We are eager for the court to resolve this issue by directing the Trump Administration to comply with court orders and provide the certainty to the many Wisconsin families and businesses who rely on FoodShare,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, the filing said.\n \n\n   \n  These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, according to the DOJ. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “In accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.”\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina, which issued partial benefits to more than 586,000 households on Friday, said it was pausing the issuance of full benefits in light of the Supreme Court decision. It had hoped to issue them over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “The hard-working people and families who rely on SNAP benefits deserve certainty, not confusion about whether they’ll be able to put meals on the table this weekend and the rest of the month,” North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement Saturday. “I am urging for a swift resolution by the courts and some humanity from the Trump administration so North Carolina families can receive the support they need.”\n \n\n   \n  In Massachusetts, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey said that residents should continue spending the benefits on their EBT cards, noting the state funded them in accordance with USDA’s Friday guidance before the Supreme Court’s pause.\n \n\n   \n  “If President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court,” Healey said in a statement Sunday, adding that state officials will continue to work to “make sure everyone gets the full benefits they are owed.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN is reaching out to other states to ask the status of their SNAP programs.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Fritze and Devan Cole contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/flight-delays-cancellations-tracker-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"13:02:00Z","title":"Tracking US flight delays and cancellations in charts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to a federal order from the Federal Aviation Administration, airlines have reduced domestic flights by 4% at 40 of the busiest US airports.

The current controversy over a misleading edit to a 2024 documentary about President Donald Trump illustrates the dynamic perfectly.\n \n\n   \n  In a vacuum, the more-than-a-year-old misstep by unnamed producers would not cause the very top heads of the organization to roll.\n \n\n   \n  But Britain’s right-wing press has been “feasting like vultures” over the bad edit, as a source at the BBC put it on condition of anonymity. And the corporation’s response to the row was feeble at best, enabling conservative critics to advance their long-running campaign against the broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  Trump celebrated the BBC shakeup on Sunday, but the political pressure over the documentary was just one of many factors at play.\n \n\n   \n  But in a politically poisonous atmosphere with near-daily disputes over coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza; the equally frequent attacks from the BBC’s rivals; and a looming review of the BBC’s license-fee model; it’s easy to understand why Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness both tendered their resignations. A sigh of relief was almost audible in their respective memos.\n \n\n   \n  “Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,” Davie wrote. Turness similarly wrote that “mistakes have been made.”\n \n\n   \n  BBC Radio 4 host and former BBC News political editor Nick Robinson spoke for many both inside and outside the organization when he said, one day before the resignations, “It’s clear that there is a genuine concern about editorial standards and mistakes. There is also a political campaign by people who want to destroy the organization.” Robinson’s point: “Both things are happening at the same time.”\n \n\n   \n  This all contributes to the fever that Davie referenced on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  He said the BBC board had unanimously supported him throughout his “entire tenure, including during recent days,” indicating he was not forced out. And he said “the current debate around BBC News” was just one factor in his departure.\n \n\n   \n  Another factor: The government is currently reviewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, which is the contract that determines how the BBC is funded and run. The current charter, which expires at the end of 2027, has a license-fee system in which British households pay £174.50 ($230) a year for BBC shows and services. This license fee structure has supported a diverse array of programming for decades, but has also opened up the BBC to all sorts of criticism.\n \n\n   \n  Some conservative leaders have argued that the license fee system is anachronistic in the age of Netflix and Spotify. They have also lobbed countless complaints about perceived political bias.\n \n\n   \n  Davie said, “I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering.”\n \n\n   \n    BBC faces politically charged media climate\n \n\n   \n  When Davie took charge in 2020, he said his No. 1 priority was “to renew our commitment to impartiality.”\n \n\n   \n  Most of the battles over the BBC relate back to that commitment in one way or another.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, for instance, the BBC removed “Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone” from its streaming service amid intense scrutiny of the documentary. The narrator was the son of a Hamas official, a conflict that breached the BBC’s editorial guidelines. Davie issued an apology after a review of the matter.\n \n\n   \n  BBC officials have highlighted and defended the news organization’s exhaustive reporting about the war. Similarly, they have urged people to take stock of the BBC’s coverage in totality — from groundbreaking exposes about the civil war   in Sudan   to thoughtful pieces about Trump’s second term in office.\n \n\n   \n  But all of that risks getting flattened when a partisan media firestorm erupts.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC is “blatant propaganda” and “total, 100% fake news,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Saturday in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper, fanning the proverbial flames against Davie and Turness.\n \n\n   \n  The trigger was a misleading edit in “Trump: A Second Chance?” In the documentary, portions of Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech to supporters at the Ellipse were stitched together to make it sound like he had said he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.” It was edited together to sound like one threatening sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tone was certainly combative that day, but in the actual speech, his exhortations to “fight” were separate from his suggestion about walking to the Capitol to “cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  The edit apparently escaped scrutiny when the documentary aired on “Panorama,” the BBC’s flagship current affairs program, shortly before the 2024 US presidential election. But it was subsequently described in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former editorial adviser to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee.\n \n\n   \n    Trump celebrates Davie’s exit\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph, which has published anti-BBC commentary for years, reported on the existence of the memo on November 3, triggering days of controversy in the United Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph published daily follow-ups about the “growing crisis at the corporation,” and amplified many critics, including by interviewing Leavitt. Meanwhile, the producers of the documentary, which was made by an outside production company, remained silent.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his aides treated Sunday’s resignations like personal victories. The president wrote on Truth Social that the BBC executives were “caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th.”\n \n\n   \n  There is no evidence that either executive was involved in the nitty gritty of the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also wrote “thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.”\n \n\n   \n  There is no indication that the edit was politically motivated. Furthermore, the documentary’s primary audience was in the UK, not the US.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt used the occasion to promote a right-wing upstart channel, GB News, that is sometimes described as the Fox News of the UK.\n \n\n   \n  To borrow Davie’s word, it is a “febrile” media environment, indeed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/health/byheart-infant-formula-outbreak-positive-bacteria","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:15:00-05:00","title":"Preliminary Tests Find Germ That Causes Botulism in ByHeart Baby Formula","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Preliminary tests have found bacteria linked to botulism toxin in a sample of ByHeart baby formula, leading to a public health alert.

botulism in ByHeart baby formula \n       \n  Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:15 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Preliminary tests showed that ByHeart baby formula contained the type of bacteria that produces the toxin linked to  a botulism outbreak , California health officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The outbreak has sickened at least 13 infants in 10 states. No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers in possession of this product should stop using it immediately,” the California Department of Public Health said in a statement late Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  More tests of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula are pending as state and federal health officials investigate the outbreak that started in mid-August. The New York-based company this weekend recalled two lots of the powdered product.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know about the outbreak and infant botulism.\n \n\n   \n    Infant botulism outbreak\n \n\n   \n  The outbreak of infant botulism has sickened babies aged 2 weeks to 5 months since mid-August. All were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  The cases occurred in Arizona, California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart officials agreed to recall two lots of the company’s Whole Nutrition Infant Formula, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The formula has a best-by date of December 2026.\n \n\n   \n  California health officials tested a can of the powdered formula that was fed to a baby who fell ill. The results “suggest the presence” of the type of bacteria that produces the botulism toxin confirmed in other cases. It can take several days to confirm the results.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart officials said that “more testing is needed” to know whether the type of bacteria that causes botulism is present. It comes from a large family of bacteria, many of which are found naturally in the environment and don’t cause illness, the company said.\n \n\n   \n  “We take this very seriously,” it said in a statement Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA is investigating reports of 83 cases of infant botulism reported since August including the cases linked to Byheart baby formula.\n \n\n   \n    Causes of infant botulism\n \n\n   \n  Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It is caused by a type of bacteria that produces toxins in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis.\n \n\n   \n  Infants younger than 1 are particularly vulnerable and can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey.\n \n\n   \n  Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel “floppy” and can have problems swallowing or breathing.\n \n\n   \n  No known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, said Dr. Steven Abrams, a University of Texas nutrition expert.\n \n\n   \n  “This would be extremely rare,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Infant botulism treatment\n \n\n   \n  The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California’s Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators.\n \n\n   \n  All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said.\n \n\n   \n    Potential impact on U.S. formula supplies\n \n\n   \n  There is no danger of infant formula shortages because of this outbreak. ByHeart, which was founded in 2016, accounts for an estimated 1% of national formula sales, according to the CDC. The company sells formula through its website and in retail stores nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  That’s different that the crisis caused when formula produced by Abbott was linked to infant deaths and illnesses in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  That product was contaminated with a different germ that can cause severe illness and death in babies. Because Abbott is one of the top manufacturers of infant formula in the U.S., the closure of its manufacturing plant in Michigan triggered massive shortages of formula across the U.S.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company’s packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii, the germ at the heart of the Abbott crisis. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing “areas that still require corrective actions.”\n \n\n   \n    Reviewing infant formula ingredients\n \n\n   \n  Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul  the U.S. food supply  and are taking a new look at  infant formula .\n \n\n   \n  Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the Food and Drug Administration  to review  the nutrients and other ingredients in infant formula, which fills the bottles of millions of American babies.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, dubbed “Operation Stork Speed,” is the first deep look at the ingredients since 1998.\n \n\n   \n  FDA officials are reviewing comments from industry, health experts and public to decide next steps.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/sport/basketball-nba-lenny-wilkens-dead-age-88","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:49:00-05:00","title":"Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens, the godfather of Seattle basketball, dies at 88","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lenny Wilkens, a three-time Basketball Hall of Fame inductee and legendary figure in the NBA, has died at age 88.

enshrined as both a player and a coach, has died, his family said Sunday. He was 88.\n \n\n   \n  The family said Wilkens was surrounded by loved ones when he died and did not immediately release a cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens was one of the finest point guards of his era who later brought his calm and savvy style to the sideline, first as a player-coach and then evolving into one of the game’s great coaches.\n \n\n   \n  He coached 2,487 games in the NBA, which is still a record. He became a Hall of Famer as a player, as a coach and again as part of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team — on which he was an assistant. Wilkens coached the Americans to gold at the Atlanta Games as well in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  “Lenny Wilkens represented the very best of the NBA — as a Hall of Fame player, Hall of Fame coach, and one of the game’s most respected ambassadors,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Sunday. “So much so that, four years ago, Lenny received the unique distinction of being named one of the league’s 75 greatest players and 15 greatest coaches of all time.”\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens was a nine-time All-Star as a player, was the first person to reach 1,000 wins as an NBA coach and was the second person inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player and coach. He coached the Seattle SuperSonics to the NBA title in 1979 and remained iconic in that city for the rest of his life, often being considered a godfather of sorts for basketball in Seattle — which lost the Sonics to Oklahoma City in 2008 and has been trying to get a team back since.\n \n\n   \n  And he did it all with grace, something he was proud of.\n \n\n   \n  “Leaders don’t yell and scream,” Wilkens told Seattle’s KOMO News earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens, the 1994 NBA coach of the year with Atlanta, retired with 1,332 coaching wins — a league record that was later passed by Don Nelson (who retired with 1,335) and then Gregg Popovich (who retired with 1,390).\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens played 15 seasons with the St. Louis Hawks, SuperSonics, Cleveland Cavaliers and Portland Trail Blazers. He was an All-Star five times with St. Louis, three times in Seattle and once with Cleveland in 1973 at age 35. A statue depicting his time with the SuperSonics was installed outside  Climate Pledge Arena  in June.\n \n\n   \n  “Even more impressive than Lenny’s basketball accomplishments, which included two Olympic gold medals and an NBA championship, was his commitment to service — especially in his beloved community of Seattle where a statue stands in his honor,” Silver said. “He influenced the lives of countless young people as well as generations of players and coaches who considered Lenny not only a great teammate or coach but also an extraordinary mentor who led with integrity and true class.”\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens twice led the league in assists but was also a prominent scorer. He averaged in double figures scoring in every season of his career, except his final one in 1974-75 with the Trail Blazers. His best season as a scorer came in his first season with the SuperSonics in 1968-69 when he averaged 22.4 points, 8.2 assists and 6.2 rebounds.\n \n\n   \n  Leonard Wilkens was born on Oct. 28, 1937, in New York. His basketball schooling came on Brooklyn’s playgrounds and at a city powerhouse, then Boys High School, where one of his teammates was major league baseball star Tommy Davis. He would go on to star at Providence and was drafted by the Hawks as the sixth overall pick in 1960.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/trump-pay-americans-directly-healthcare","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00Z","title":"What is Trump’s proposal to pay Americans directly for health care costs?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has proposed redirecting Affordable Care Act tax credits from insurers to individual Americans, allowing them to directly purchase health care plans.

Rick Scott enthusiastically announced on X that he’s “writing the bill right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Currently, ACA enrollees who qualify for tax credits, also known as premium subsidies, never see the funds.

Lindsey Graham called the ACA “the biggest scam on the planet,” touting Trump’s proposition to put money in the pockets of Americans to purchase their own insurance plans.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina Republican predicted a weekend “breakthrough” in funding talks on Capitol Hill, where negotiators so far have not presented a compromise deal that includes an ACA solution that would win over enough Democrats to back a short-term bill to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’ll have a breakthrough today. Then we’ll talk about how to change Obamacare to give the money to the people rather than insurance companies,” he told “Fox Sunday Futures.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats so far have shown no appetite to seriously consider Trump’s proposal.\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries quickly dismissed the idea in an interview on Sunday as he slammed the GOP’s openness to negotiate a real fix to the health care system.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, there’s always opportunity to improve current policy that exists, but Republicans aren’t operating in good faith as it relates to doing anything to actually make health care more affordable,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen.

EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New Glenn, the towering orbital rocket that  Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin  designed to compete with SpaceX’s dominant Falcon rockets, is back for its second launch ever — this time with a job to send twin spacecraft on a long, winding trip to Mars.\n \n\n   \n  The 322-foot (98-meter) rocket was set to take off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida during an 88-minute launch window that opened at 2:45 p.m. ET on Sunday. But Blue Origin revealed during  a livestream  that cloud cover rolled into the area, preventing liftoff. (Rockets often seek to avoid clouds because flying through one that is electrified can actually trigger a lightening strike.)\n \n\n   \n  “We’re reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt based on forecasted weather,” the company said in a social media post.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin officials previously indicated they have the ability to try again during a launch window on Monday. The weather forecast for that opportunity, however, appeared “somewhat consistent” with Sunday’s conditions, noted Laura Maginnis, New Glenn’s vice president of mission management, during a Saturday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  The Federal Aviation Administration recently said that it would be  putting a stop  to commercial rocket launches between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. ET, beginning Monday, to ease the burden on air traffic controllers amid the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working really closely with both our partners at the FAA and with the NASA team to ensure that we’re, of course, honoring and respecting the airspace expectations,” Maginnis said.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin’s launch window on Monday would run between 2:40 and 4:08 p.m. ET, according to a news release.\n \n\n   \n    Blue Origin aims to reuse rocket boosters\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin is also attempting to land and recover New Glenn’s first-stage booster, which is the bottommost portion of the rocket that gives the initial burst of power at liftoff, on a seafaring barge called Jacklyn. Much like Blue Origin’s  chief competitor, SpaceX  — which has long been a dominant force in the commercial launch business — Blue Origin rockets are designed to be partially reused in order to drive down costs.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin had hoped to nail its first attempt at landing a booster on New Glenn’s inaugural orbital flight in January, but engines failed to reignite properly, causing the rocket to veer off course.\n \n\n   \n  However, the primary mission of Blue Origin’s January launch — delivering a test satellite called the Blue Ring Pathfinder to orbit — went off without a hitch, prompting the company to declare the flight a success.\n \n\n   \n  But Blue Origin does view safely recovering and reusing its rocket boosters as crucial for its business model.\n \n\n   \n  Maginnis said during the Saturday news conference that working to pinpoint why the booster did not stick its landing in January, and implementing fixes to help it succeed this time around, were the primary reasons Blue Origin waited nearly 10 months to attempt a second New Glenn launch.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve incorporated a number of changes to our propellant management system, some minor hardware changes as well, to increase our likelihood of landing that booster,” Maginnis said.\n \n\n   \n  But, she added, “if we don’t land the booster — that’s OK. We have several more vehicles in production.”\n \n\n   \n  Maginnis declined to specify how many boosters Blue Origin has in production.\n \n\n   \n  The next New Glenn flight, which had been slated for this year but does not currently have a target launch date, is expected to deliver a Blue Origin-designed lunar lander called Mark 1 to the moon’s surface.\n \n\n   \n    NASA Escapade’s Mars mission\n \n\n   \n  After taking flight, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket will set twin satellites on a path into deep space. The orbiters are expected to linger in a holding pattern before heading for Mars next year when the red planet is better aligned for a less fuel-intensive journey.\n \n\n   \n  The mission, called Escapade — short for Escape and Plasma Acceleration Dynamics Explorers — is a low-cost planetary science project funded by NASA and spearheaded by the University of California, Berkeley, with support from commercial companies Advanced Space and Rocket Lab.\n \n\n   \n  If all goes to plan, the vehicles will arrive in Martian orbit in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  Once there, the spacecraft will work in tandem to investigate why the planet began to lose its atmosphere billions of years ago — and to study how its harsh climate may affect future explorers.\n \n\n   \n  “We will be making the space weather measurements we need to understand the system well enough to forecast solar storms whose radiation could harm astronauts on the surface of Mars or in orbit,” said the mission’s principal investigator, Robert Lillis, of UC Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/trump-washington-commanders-stadium-name-nfl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"14:16:00Z","title":"White House says Washington Commanders stadium bearing Trump’s name would be ‘beautiful’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House has expressed support for naming the Washington Commanders' new stadium in Washington, D.C., after President Donald Trump, citing his role in enabling the stadium's rebuilding as a reason for the endorsement.

Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Democrats’  sweeping election victory  on Tuesday, including the approval of a  redistricting ballot measure  in his state, “represents a new moment” for the Democratic Party as it debates its path forward.\n \n\n   \n  “Clarity, conviction, purpose, energy. On our toes, not on our heels. A resurgent Democratic Party, and it’s a party that understands what’s at stake for our democracy,” Newsom said during a wide-ranging interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in Houston on Saturday.   \n \n\n   \n  Along with the approval of California’s Proposition 50, which creates five US House seats more favorable for Democrats, the party won in high-profile races across the country on Tuesday.  Zohran Mamdani  was elected mayor of New York City, while  Abigail Spanberger  and  Mikie Sherrill  won gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom traveled to Houston on Saturday for a rally, during which he touted the win and also credited Texas Democrats for inspiring the push for Proposition 50.\n \n\n   \n  “I think just the energy that the delegation from Texas brought to the Democratic Party, to democracy as a whole, when they stood up and pushed back against (Texas Gov.) Greg Abbott and Donald Trump’s overreach … in many ways that was the beginning of this comeback,” Newsom said to Tapper following the rally.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Texas Republicans moved to redraw the state’s congressional maps to shift five US House seats to the right at President Donald Trump’s behest. The move sparked outrage among state legislative Democrats, who left Texas to avoid a vote. They  ultimately returned , and the maps were passed and  signed into law .\n \n\n   \n  In response, Democrats in California began the efforts to redraw the state’s congressional maps. Newsom, who is widely expected to be a 2028 presidential candidate,  made himself the face  of California’s redistricting efforts and nationalized the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom acknowledged criticism that California made the redistricting process partisan, including from  Republican former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , and told Tapper that he supports “independent redistricting.”\n \n\n   \n  “But you can’t do it state by state with one arm tied behind your back,” he said. “You can’t unilaterally disarm as other people are not playing by the rules.”\n \n\n   \n  After the GOP win in Texas, Republicans have also redrawn seats in their favor in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio, and they are attempting to do the same in other states, including Indiana and Kansas.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, following California’s lead, Democrats are seeking changes to maps in at least three other states: New York, Virginia and Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not screwing around. They’re consolidating power,” Newsom said of Republicans’ efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom also weighed in on attending the COP30 climate summit this week in Brazil as the Trump administration has decided not to send a  high-level delegation .\n \n\n   \n  When asked what his role will be at the summit and whether he’s standing in for the president, Newsom said he’ll be “standing in for my kids and grandkids, for common sense, for, you know, our economic future.”    \n \n\n   \n  During the interview, Newsom also reiterated his warnings of the threat he says Trump poses to democracy.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, Newsom claimed, “it’s not about the rule of law. It’s about the rule of Don.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is not normal times,” he later added. “The rules have changed and we need to change.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Eric Bradner, Arit John and David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/americas/brazil-rio-deadly-raid-criminal-gangs-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"17:27:00Z","title":"Behind Rio’s Deadly Raid: Brazil’s Billion-Dollar Criminal Networks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the violent 'Operation Containment' raid in Rio de Janeiro’s favelas on October 28, 2025, targeting the Comando Vermelho (Red Command) gang.

The Red Command, founded in 1979 in Cândido Mendes Penitentiary, and the PCC, formed in 1993 after the Carandiru massacre, have grown into powerful criminal networks with extensive control over drug trafficking and local economies. The two gangs now compete over drug supply routes, leading to violence, prison uprisings, and territorial wars. Despite a military response, the gangs continue to operate from behind prison walls through coded communications. The article highlights the deep societal divide: while some, like congressman Luiz Lima, view the raids as necessary to combat high homicide rates, others, including human rights advocates like Daniela Fichino, argue that the state’s actions dehumanize poor, Black communities and perpetuate cycles of violence. Community members like Thainã de Medeiros emphasize the lack of safety and trust, noting that such operations disrupt vital social projects like youth employment programs. Ultimately, the article reveals a structural crisis in Brazil’s approach to crime — where militarized responses fail to dismantle criminal power and instead reinforce it, leaving favela communities in a state of perpetual fear and instability.","keyTakeAways":["The Red Command and PCC are two of Brazil’s most powerful criminal organizations, originating from prison environments during Brazil's

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:27 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Armored vehicles rumbling through narrow alleys. Rifle shots cracking in heavy crossfire. Helicopters and weaponized drones firing from above. Soldiers in military gear engaged in violent combat. Bodies scattered on blood-slicked streets.\n \n\n   \n  These could be scenes from a war zone.  But on October 28, they unfolded not on a desolate battlefield but on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro — a postcard city better known for its breathtaking coastline and lively bossa nova music scene.\n \n\n   \n  “Operation Containment” brought 2,500 police officers, soldiers and snipers up the slopes of Rio’s Complexo da Penha and Complexo do Alemão favelas, home to roughly 110,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  Their target was the Comando Vermelho (CV), or Red Command, a criminal organization that has ruled these hillside shantytowns for decades. During the operation, at least 117 suspected gunmen and four police officers were killed, and about 100 people were arrested. Authorities said they seized 118 weapons, including 91 rifles and 14 explosive devices, as well as a ton of drugs.\n \n\n   \n  The raid followed a year-long investigation into the Red Command and was triggered in part by the gang’s expansion into new territories, a recent surge in violence and an effort by authorities to reassert state control.\n \n\n   \n  Officials called the raid a success. But with at least 121 dead, and early reports putting the toll at 132, the operation drew sharp criticism from local and international human rights groups. It also laid bare a deep divide over how to confront Brazil’s entrenched organized crime syndicates.\n \n\n   \n    Life in a crossfire\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not the first time we see blood being spilled for a ‘greater good,’” said Thainã de Medeiros, who lived in Complexo da Penha for 35 years. “But this ‘good’ never comes.”\n \n\n   \n  Now a community organizer and member of an anti-violence collective who works in the favela, Medeiros is no stranger to how the Red Command instills fear in its territories. “You walk around and see people carrying big rifles on every corner, standing by your door with grenades and pistols,” he said. “No one feels safe. And there is always the risk of instability — of another operation like this.”\n \n\n   \n  The gangs also “determine who gets in and operates inside the communities,” said Rafael Alcadipani, a member of the Brazilian Forum on Public Security, a nonprofit civic group. “Internet companies, for instance, need to pay them a fee to offer service in the area. They issue permits for people to build houses — not the government.”\n \n\n   \n  The rise in violence, weaponry and gang control in the favelas has made it increasingly difficult for government officials and police to access these areas.\n \n\n   \n  “The state abandons these communities, and then gangs end up gaining even more control,” Alcadipani said.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s criminal organizations have also extended their reach from the illegal economy to politics through such means as vote-buying, violence, intimidation and the funding of political candidates, as studies and police investigations have found, helping them to become one of the most powerful gangs in South America.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A necessary operation’\n \n\n   \n  Luiz Lima, a right-leaning congressman representing Rio, defended the October 28 raid as unavoidable.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a necessary operation,” Lima told CNN. “What happened that day — 117 criminals killed — happens every day in Brazil. With more than 38,000 homicides last year, “that’s 106 deaths a day,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lima insisted that the public backs a tougher stance and that the vast majority of favela residents supported the operation.\n \n\n   \n  “The people living there are extorted,” he said. “Their shops are extorted. Women are raped by traffickers. It’s unbearable.”\n \n\n   \n  But Daniela Fichino, deputy director of the human rights group Global Justice, blames “a state policy that defines an entire population as disposable.” She added: “Brazil doesn’t have the death penalty, and yet the state acts as if it does — simultaneously finding, prosecuting and executing young, Black, poor residents under the banner of public security.”\n \n\n   \n  The result, Fichino said, is “a perpetual cycle of war that reinforces the very criminal structures it claims to dismantle.”\n \n\n   \n  The debate over lasting solutions reveals the complexity of how criminal organizations have grown so powerful, weaving themselves into nearly every layer of Brazilian society over time.\n \n\n   \n    A faction born from dictatorship\n \n\n   \n  The Red Command was founded in 1979 inside an island prison off the coast of Rio, the Cândido Mendes Penitentiary, where common criminals were locked up alongside leftist political prisoners opposed to the Brazilian military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. In the harsh conditions there, what began as an informal alliance for protection soon became an organized network.\n \n\n   \n  One of its founders, William da Silva Lima, spent more than 30 years behind bars after being convicted of armed robbery, extortion and kidnapping. In prison, he became a spokesman for other inmates and negotiated with authorities.\n \n\n   \n  The deplorable conditions inside the nineteenth-century Cândido Mendes — long known among inmates as the “Cauldron of Hell” — pushed prisoners to organize in resistance, da Silva Lima wrote in his 2010 book, recounting the origin of the Red Command and his part in creating the Brazilian organized crime group.\n \n\n   \n  When political prisoners were released in 1979, da Silva Lima wrote, members of what was then called the Falange Vermelha  or Red Phalanx, began orchestrating mass prison breaks and investing in the burgeoning cocaine trade.\n \n\n   \n  By 1985, the Red Command controlled roughly 70% of all drug-selling points in Rio — and the city’s deadly turf wars with other factions began.\n \n\n   \n  According to Márcio Sérgio Christino, a São Paulo state criminal prosecutor and author of a book on the gangs, while the Red Command is Brazil’s oldest faction, it is not the biggest — although its recent expansion shows it aims to achieve that goal. Its main obstacle is not the police or the government, he said, but a competing faction: bigger, better organized and highly influential in South America.\n \n\n   \n    Brazil’s biggest underground empire: The PCC\n \n\n   \n  Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), or First Capital Command, is a criminal organization created in 1993 that also has its genesis in a prison — the Taubaté Penitentiary in São Paulo. Its founders were survivors of the Carandiru massacre the year before, when 111 inmates were killed by military police.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until February 2001 that the group revealed its full reach. In what became known as the “big rebellion,” PCC members coordinated uprisings in 29 prisons simultaneously. About 27,000 inmates were involved, leaving at least 16 killed and 77 injured, among those incarcerated and police officers. At the end of the 27-hour uprising, the flag of the PCC — black and white, some accompanied by handmade signs reading “peace and justice” — was raised across São Paulo’s penitentiaries. The message was clear: the state had lost control.\n \n\n   \n  “At first, their focus was … controlling the prison environment,” Christino explained. “Then they began to grow, to organize, and one of their main pillars became the drug trade.”\n \n\n   \n  To obtain a higher-quality supply of cocaine, the PCC expanded into Brazil’s border states with Bolivia and Paraguay — two of South America’s main cocaine sources. With the US market already dominated by Mexico and Colombia, cocaine producers in landlocked Bolivia focused on reaching Europe, and a deal was struck.\n \n\n   \n  “Bolivia agreed to sell only to the PCC,” Christino said. “In return, the PCC handled transport, logistics and sales — to Europe, Africa, and beyond.”\n \n\n   \n    From friends to rivals\n \n\n   \n  Until then, the Red Command and PCC were not enemies. But their fragile coexistence collapsed once the Red Command, blocked from Bolivia, turned to Peru and built a cocaine trade that operates almost entirely within Brazil. Notably, the gang came to dominate supply routes through the northern part of the country, using the major rivers and their tributaries of the Amazon region.\n \n\n   \n  Competition over these routes ignited a series of prison riots and massacres across northern Brazil, Christino said.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at those uprisings — dozens, sometimes hundreds of deaths, even cannibalism — that was all about the routes,” he said. “It was a territorial war.”\n \n\n   \n  The syndicates now clash for control of Brazil’s highways, rivers and prisons as they branch out into other criminal realms.\n \n\n   \n  A 2025 study by the Brazilian Forum on Public Security found that gangs such as the Red Command and PCC generated 146.8 billion Brazilian reais ($27 billion) in 2022 through the illegal trade of gold, fuel, alcohol and cigarettes — nearly 10 times more than from cocaine trafficking, which was estimated at 15 billion reais ($2.8 billion).\n \n\n   \n  They also engage in money laundering and invest in construction firms, transport companies, fuel distributors and even crypto markets to wash billions of reals in illicit profits.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the command centers: An ongoing battle\n \n\n   \n  Investigations by the Public Ministry of Rio de Janeiro show that gang leaders continue to issue orders from behind bars — through coded messages, letters and encrypted apps.\n \n\n   \n  While high-risk inmates have been isolated in individual cells, the flow of information never truly stops, said Christino. “There’s no such thing as absolute isolation,” he said. “Cellphones still get in, and when they don’t, messages travel through lawyers or visitors. There’s always a way.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, the Federal District’s Secretariat of Penitentiary Administration said that “intelligence units operate in close coordination with other security forces and the judiciary to monitor faction-linked inmates.” They work to determine an inmate’s position in the hierarchy and isolate leaders “to prevent them from issuing orders,” the secretariat said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite these measures, investigators acknowledge that Brazil’s penitentiaries remain the backbone of command and communication for its largest criminal organizations — a paradox that the state struggles to contain.\n \n\n   \n  “The state’s militarized response only strengthens the factions,” Alcadipani said. “Each operation kills dozens, but the leadership remains. For every man who dies, another fills the gap … What we have now is reactive — a war without an endgame.”\n \n\n   \n  “We were about to launch a partnership with UNICEF” to help favela youth enter the job market, said Medeiros, the community organizer. Career fairs were scheduled for the day after the deadly operation in the Rio favelas. “We had to cancel everything,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, I thought today I’d be finalizing the details for that beautiful day,” he said. “Instead, we were cleaning bodies from the streets. And now, we’re bracing for what’s next.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/us/ice-immigration-federal-agencies-trump","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00+00:00","title":"July 2023 Economic Landscape: Policy, Markets, and Investor Confidence","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An in-depth analysis of the economic landscape in July 2023, highlighting the impact of recent policy changes, market indicators, and business developments on investor sentiment and market performance.

Other personnel are troops with the National Guard, the  reserve arm  of the Army and Air Force.\n \n\n   \n  Here is a look at the agencies involved and how their complicated and often overlapping duties have evolved under the current administration’s deportation policy.\n \n\n   \n    Customs and Border Protection\n \n\n   \n  In its  own words , US Customs and Border Protection “is one of the world’s largest law enforcement organizations and is charged with keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the U.S. while facilitating lawful international travel and trade.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency started as the Customs Administration in 1789 to collect tariffs, the federal government’s primary source of revenue at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Back then, the United States was effectively an “open borders” country until the passage of a  law  in 1875 blocking the immigration of most Chinese women on the premise of curbing prostitution and human trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Full federal border inspections under a new agency  began  in 1891, which later became the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n \n\n   \n  The functions of enforcing immigration law and collecting tariffs and customs duties stayed separate until shortly after the   September 11 terror attacks , when a push to consolidate more agencies under the new Department of Homeland Security  created  Customs and Border Protection in 2003.\n \n\n   \n  “The intent was to create a single focused agency responsible for issues at the border,” Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service who is now at the Migration Policy Institute, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The sizeable agency has more than  60,000 employees , including about 20,000 Border Patrol agents, all tasked with one mission: “Protect the American people, safeguard our borders, and enhance the nation’s economic prosperity.”\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  Two decades later, the Border Patrol division of CBP has taken on an increasingly significant role in high-profile immigration actions under Trump, with sector chief  Gregory Bovino  emerging as the  on-the-ground face  of “Operation Midway Blitz.” The initiative targets “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago,”  DHS says .\n \n\n   \n  Armed agents, who once apprehended migrants across the US’s borders and stopped drug and human trafficking operations, now stand sentinel over federal immigration facilities that are the sites of immigration protests.\n \n\n   \n  “These officers are not accustomed to policing urban civil unrest; nor are they trained to do so,” former CBP Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske  testified  in a  lawsuit  filed by journalists. The lawsuit stemmed from what they called “overwhelming and illegal violence” against protesters in Los Angeles this summer, a response that was also helmed by Bovino.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions from the summer’s violent clashes between immigration officers and demonstrators continued to boil over this fall in America’s largest cities.\n \n\n   \n   Jason Houser , a former DHS official, said the current administration is putting Border Patrol agents in security and crowd control situations they’re not equipped to handle.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re trained for border interdiction, terrorist threats, drug interdictions on swift boats,” Houser said. “Those tactics aren’t for de-escalation of a protest or riots. That’s not their core training.”\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago, the indelible image of a  pastor in a clerical collar  shot in the head with a pepper ball by agents standing on the rooftop of an ICE building is a direct violation of CBP’s use of force  policy .\n \n\n   \n  Officers using pepper balls “shall not intentionally target the head, neck, spine, or groin of the intended subject, unless the use of deadly force is reasonable,” ﻿the  policy  states.\n \n\n   \n  But Bovino, who has said agents have acted proportionally and in response to attacks from demonstrators, expressed ambivalence about protesters being injured – also a direct violation of CBP’s use of force  policy. \n \n\n   \n  “If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that’s on them,” Bovino  told CBS News  in October. “Don’t protest and don’t trespass.”\n \n\n   \n  Like many law enforcement agencies since 9/11, the CBP has substantially beefed up its equipment with military-style weaponry and aircraft, including a  fleet  of Black Hawk helicopters and Predator drones.\n \n\n   \n  The equipment was put to use in an  overnight raid  in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood, when agents clad in tactical gear  rappelled  from a Black Hawk helicopter and burst through the windows of an apartment building to pull families from their homes.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been on military bases for a good portion of my life, and the activity I saw – it was an invasion,”  said  neighbor Darrell Ballard.\n \n\n   \n  The show of force in Operation Midway Blitz even included sending  speedboats  – the kind   typically seen on the waterways along the nation’s borders – to patrol the Chicago River, in the shadow of the Windy City’s Trump International Hotel and Tower.\n \n\n   \n  The boats “are from Detroit. Those are interdiction patrol boats that patrol up and down the border between Canada and Michigan,” said Houser, who worries their presence in Chicago leaves the northern border vulnerable.\n \n\n   \n  “If they’re not there in Michigan, does that mean those smuggling lines are open that day, but they were out going up and down (the Chicago River) like it was St. Patrick’s Day?”\n \n\n   \n  CBP has not said if the Border Patrol assets used on the Chicago River impacted operations along the Canadian border and did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  While a city that is more than 400 miles from the nearest international border crossing may seem like an unusual choice for intense stops and searches, there is a legal loophole.\n \n\n   \n  The CBP can legally conduct warrantless searches of vehicles and property believed to be involved in immigration violations anywhere within 100 miles of the US border or coastline. The agency also  includes  the entire coastline of Lake Michigan, which lies fully within the United States, as the “functional equivalent” of an international border.\n \n\n   \n  Under CBP policy, Chicago is as much of a border town as El Paso, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “Border enforcement does need to be as modern as possible and as updated as possible in terms of technology,” Meissner said. “But it should be taking place at the border because that’s the crossing point.”\n \n\n   \n    Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n \n\n   \n  Like its cousin CBP, ICE started as part of the new Department of Homeland Security in 2003. But in addition to having a catchier name, ICE had a different mission – focus on the nation’s interior to catch and deport undocumented immigrants, along with investigating “narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, gang violence, money laundering and other financial crimes,” the agency’s website  says .\n \n\n   \n  To accomplish these two very different tasks, the agency has two divisions: Enforcement and Removal Operations, which deports people in the country illegally, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), where  agents  “launch and pursue investigations into transnational crime.”\n \n\n   \n  During the Biden administration, HSI took steps to rebrand itself and  set up  its own website to try to distinguish its work from deportations.\n \n\n   \n  “The civil immigration enforcement side of the ICE mission is not what HSI does,” Katrina Berger, then-executive associate director of HSI,  told ABC News  last year, a few months before retiring.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of his second term, Trump made clear that ICE – including HSI – has a singular focus under his administration.\n \n\n   \n  “The primary mission of (HSI) is the enforcement of … (laws) related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States,” the president  said  in an executive order signed on Inauguration Day.\n \n\n   \n  The HSI patch on uniforms has become a common sight in immigration raids. It was the lead agency in the  operation  at a Georgia Hyundai plant in September that  rounded up  nearly 500 workers accused of being in the country illegally.\n \n\n   \n  While HSI is typically the  lead  on worksite enforcement issues, former agency leaders fear that increasing HSI’s focus on removing undocumented workers from the country comes at the expense of investigating more significant dangers to the US, like targeting the importation of  fentanyl  and firearms  smuggling .\n \n\n   \n  “HSI, within ICE, has always been focused on human smuggling, sex trafficking, cybercrimes, Deep Web threats to children,” said Houser, who served as the ICE chief of staff during the Biden administration. “What we see now is a fundamental shifting away from that focus on national security.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency has also faced criticism for  aggressive tactics  used by ICE agents in executing the president’s immigration policy. Migrants have been  pulled from cars ,  off streets  and  tackled in courthouses  by masked agents.\n \n\n   \n  The heavy-handed tactics have also been used to control crowds at protests, where federal agents have at times used pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear gas to clear  demonstrators .\n \n\n   \n  ICE and US Customs and Border Protection agents are trained “to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officers under DHS are “highly trained” in de-escalation tactics and “regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois’ Democratic governor disagreed, accusing the agents of being provocative with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “ICE is causing this mayhem,” Gov. JB Pritzker  said . “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois state Rep. Hoan Huynh says he got firsthand experience after accusing an ICE agent of  pointing a gun  at him when he was following an ICE vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  “These are ICE agents who are wearing masks. Their badges aren’t very clear,” Huynh  told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not comment on whether a gun was drawn, but McLaughlin accused Huynh of “stalking law enforcement” and said agents had to “assess if he was a threat.”\n \n\n   \n  Huynh’s encounter demonstrates the difficulty people have just figuring out what agency an officer represents, especially since most DHS agencies do not have standard uniforms.\n \n\n   \n   Video  of the incident shows the  ICE agents  wearing camo uniforms marked with “POLICE.” The agency’s tan and olive shoulder patch blends into the camouflage color scheme. On a backpack, another agent is identified as being with “SRT,” the ICE Special Response Team, with SWAT-style training. Another uniform appears to say BORTAC, the Border Patrol’s own tactical unit. None of the uniforms seen in the video specifically said ICE.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Chicago expressed her own concerns about the confusion caused when agents aren’t clearly identified, issuing an  order  that all agents “must have visible identification.”\n \n\n   \n  “The way that they’re carrying on without any visible identification – even that they’re law enforcement, much less what agency they’re with – it really is pretty unprecedented to see at this scale, and I think it’s very dangerous,”  said Scott Shuchart , a senior ICE official during the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just the uniforms – masked federal officers have also become the  new calling card  of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  DHS officials say the masks are necessary to deal with increasing threats against ICE agents, including violence from protesters and doxxing.\n \n\n   \n  Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has said  federal officers are covering up to protect their families  after some have been publicly identified and then harassed online, along with relatives.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a proponent of the masks at all, but if it’s going to keep officers safe, it’s going to keep people from using advanced AI to find out their addresses and their families’ information, then by all means I’ll let them do it,” he  told NewsNation  in October.\n \n\n   \n   John Sandweg , an acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama and a former acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, has been on dozens of ride-alongs during his tenure and said he never saw anyone wear a mask.\n \n\n   \n  “When you’re at ICE and you’re at DHS, the first and highest priority is the safety of the workforce, and you have to do what’s necessary to protect them, but I think there’s no doubt it’s gone past what any reasonable policy would allow, and it really has to be a situation where it’s the exception, not the rule,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    US Coast Guard\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard was created in 1915 after a  merger  of agencies that focused on maritime tax evasion and emergency response on the high seas. The Coast Guard is responsible for “safety, security, and stewardship” on the water.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, its jurisdiction has expanded to include coverage of inland waterways, coastlines, bridges and ports.\n \n\n   \n  It is the only agency of government that is a branch of the military but operates as a civilian law enforcement agency during peacetime. The Coast Guard has been under civilian command since the end of World War II, and DHS has been in charge of the agency since 2003.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard’s unique hybrid structure straddling the military and civilian worlds allows Trump a great deal of leeway in deployment. But the administration has turned its focus to largely urban areas instead of waterways, relegating the Coast Guard to a supporting role.\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard said it was  preparing to support CBP agents  at the Coast Guard base in Alameda, California.\n \n\n   \n  It is working with other agencies to “detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border,” the Coast Guard told CNN affiliate  KCRA .\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Coast Guard “ personnel defensively fired their weapons ” at a U-Haul truck backing toward them outside the Coast Guard base in Alameda, where a  protest  had taken place against an anticipated federal deployment in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n \n\n   \n  No Coast Guard personnel were hurt, DHS  said  at the time, and the driver’s injury was not life-threatening,  according to  the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.\n \n\n   \n  Trump later  stood down  on plans to “surge” resources to San Francisco after friends, including local tech executives Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Marc Benioff of Salesforce, told him San Francisco had made “substantial progress” against crime.\n \n\n   \n    National Guard\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard says its beginnings go back more than a century before the Revolutionary War, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony  established  its own permanent militia. But the current organization didn’t come  until 1933 , when the National Guard Mobilization Act created a unique two-tiered structure.\n \n\n   \n  Today’s National Guard is the descent of state militias and also the combat reserve for the Army and Air Force. The National Guard is under the direction of its state’s governor, who decides when and where to deploy troops. The president has full power over the  DC National Guard  and can also federalize the states’ National Guard for US operations in the case of an emergency when “regular forces” are unable to enforce federal law. Exactly what the law means by “regular forces” is still being discussed in the courts.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Trump’s call-ups this year in Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon, the last time the National Guard was put under federal control for an operation within American borders was during the Los Angeles riots in 1992 – and it was  coordinated with state officials  at the time.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s attempt to invoke a rarely used law to deploy National Guard troops to several major American cities to curb crime and shut down protests has been one of the most striking and legally aggressive moves by the president — and one that’s come up against legal  challenges   over  and  over  again.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration recently attempted to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to protect ICE facilities that have been targeted by demonstrators in  Chicago  and  Portland , comparing the cities to a war zone and saying there is either “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion”  there .\n \n\n   \n  “You look at a place like Portland, it’s just — it’s ridiculous, when they say that there’s no problem. The place is — it was on fire over the weekend,” the president  said  last month.\n \n\n   \n  But both deployments have been halted by federal judges who say there is no justification to bring in the military.\n \n\n   \n  In  August , Trump  announced he is placing  the Washington, DC, police department “ under direct federal control ” and deploying National Guard troops to the nation’s capital, saying the move is aimed at restoring order in the city. The president has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC, but overall crime numbers are  lower this year  than in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,000 National Guard troops in DC are stationed throughout the city at metro stations and monuments or memorials, while other soldiers and airmen are helping with “beautification projects,” like picking up trash, replanting grass and spreading mulch.\n \n\n   \n  The ongoing mission costs about  $1 million  a day, experts estimated to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The president brought the stepped-up law enforcement model next to Memphis, Tennessee, in an attempt to crack down on crime. The move marked the first such effort in a Republican state, and Tennessee Republicans, including Gov. Bill Lee,  welcomed the announcement .\n \n\n   \n  Like in Washington, DC, the National Guard troops in Memphis are not dedicated just to securing federal property but are also supporting local law enforcement in their operations.\n \n\n   \n  Although the city’s leadership disagreed with the Guard’s deployment, officials have cooperated and  advised  residents that the troops will be “serving as extra ‘eyes and ears’ in our neighborhoods.”\n \n\n   \n  “I want to be clear I did not ask for the National Guard and I don’t think it is the way to drive down crime,” Mayor Paul Young  said  in September. “However, that decision has already been made.”\n \n\n   \n  Young and others said they wanted the task force to  focus on targeting violent offenders  rather than use their presence to scare, harass or intimidate the general public.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic-elected officials in Tennessee filed a  lawsuit   trying to stop the Memphis deployment, but the court has taken no action yet.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, graphic designer Leah Abucayan and photo editor Austin Steele contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/health/infant-formula-recall-botulism","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"11:02:00-05:00","title":"Infant Botulism in 10 U.S. States Linked to Formula Being Recalled","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A voluntary recall of two lots of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula has been initiated after 13 infants across 10 U.S. states—Arizona, California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington—were hospitalized with symptoms of infant botulism.

fried chicken and British delicacies: How an appetite for originality transformed celebrity interviews \n       \n  By Yahya Salem, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:48 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Woody Harrelson, the acclaimed actor known for his mellow and jovial energy, was breaking down, barely able to string together coherent sentences because his mouth was on fire from the ludicrously spicy hot sauce that coated his fried cauliflower. Of course, the pain is what you order by coming on Hot Ones, the beloved hot wings YouTube show.\n \n\n   \n  Once it was over, Harrelson still coughing, admitted to  host Sean Evans , “You nearly killed me, dude … and I say that with all due respect, because I know you nearly kill people on the daily.”\n \n\n   \n  Harrelson said that he never thought he’d do the show because he used to think he didn’t have what it took to get to the end of the  poultry gauntlet . “And now, here we are,” he said, victorious.\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment, while proclaimed in jest, captures a current appetite among many celebrities and fans alike to break away from conventional interviews in favor of more authentic and flavorful content.\n \n\n   \n  And what else like breaking bread – or chicken wings or, you know,  yeast extract  – has the ability to break that artifice, foster trust and entice celebrities to lower their guards for a playful exchange to which audiences can relate.\n \n\n   \n  “The hardest part of the interview is penetrating all of that artifice to get something real,” Evans told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  Ollie Kendal, one-half of the food content creator duo, JOLLY, put it even more succinctly in a separate conversation with CNN: “It’s the language everyone speaks: Food…Everyone’s got to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  And trust that people eat up the chance to see Gordon Ramsey serenade Evans with his trademark colorful language while chugging bubblegum-pink stomach soother on what has become Hot Ones’ most watched episode, or John Cena stoically brave the potent musk of British Black pudding (blood sausage) with JOLLY as he declares it a sign of sophistication.\n \n\n   \n  Hot Ones, JOLLY and Amelia Dimoldenberg’s  Chicken Shop Date  – with billions of combined total views and tens of millions of subscribers – are some of the most visible examples of the genre’s popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Many descendants have followed, including traditional media companies that are still trying to find new spins on the concept. (See: The NYT’s launch of “The Pizza Interview,” which asks press-touring celebrities to toss some dough while trying not to get their likely borrowed outfits covered in sauce.)\n \n\n   \n  In what is arguably the boom of the feed-the-famous frenzy, a natural question has emerged: Is it reaching the point of being bloated or is there more to feast on?\n \n\n   \n    Spicing up the press tour\n \n\n   \n  Food’s place within entertainment has never been a gimmick. In fact, it’s an interviewing tradition that dates back decades and has taken many forms.\n \n\n   \n  Jessa Moore, a media specialist with experience in food and tech, points out that culinary hosts like Martha Stewart and Ina Garten have featured celebrities on their shows since the nineties and early aughts. Even  I Love to Eat , the first network TV cooking show to air in the US back in 1946, featured famous designer and actress, Elsie de Wolfe.\n \n\n   \n  Morning shows, too, have for decades welcomed celebrities into their set kitchens for early-morning meal-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is entertainment, it’s something you bond over,” Moore told CNN, “Food is culture. People want to interact with each other, and food provides the glue for that.”\n \n\n   \n  In the mid-2010s, the format saw a new iteration of the approach emerge with a gourmet of YouTube shows featuring hungry celebrities – a disruption to what Evans called a “boring,” “PR-driven flight pattern.”\n \n\n   \n  “Hot Ones” mixed up the media blitz. Ten years after its first episode, it is now a desired destination for megastars such as Jennifer Lawrance, Idris Elba,  Lady Gaga  and Shaquille O’Neal, whose reactions to the exponential Scoville levels have been immortalized in internet lore.\n \n\n   \n  “What these food-driven formats reveal is that adding a slice of real life to the interview process (a meal, a drink, or any shared activity) invites authenticity, connection and unexpected honesty,” Lindsay Colker, founder of Elevate Communications, a Los Angeles-based public relations and consulting boutique, told CNN. “And that’s where the magic and the viral moments tend to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Colker highlighted the format’s ability to blur the lines between “press appearance and personality showcase,” which is aided by hosts who are “often culture-shapers in their own right - disarming, conversational and curious.”\n \n\n   \n  “They know how to draw out personality instead of polished talking points,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But she emphasized that food-themed interviews – and the wave of new media at large – are complementary and not a replacement to traditional celebrity coverage.\n \n\n   \n  What’s remarkable about these YouTube food-themed interviews is the fact that the ingredients to their success aren’t concealed in secret family heirloom or fabled recipes; no 11 herbs and spices kept away from the other online creators. It’s a straightforward blend of originality, ingenuity and accessibility.\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY had already invested years in creating food content prior to featuring celebrities in their videos. Josh Carrott, the other half of JOLLY, and Kendal said that getting celebrities to share food and culture away from the “sterile, sanitized junket world,” is not a fading gimmick they’re squeezing for views.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is like the great connector,” Carrott said. “I think over the years, our content has evolved into sharing culture through food.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Like’ and subscribe\n \n\n   \n  Evans likens the growth of food-themed interviews to that of podcasts, which were once relatively obscure but are now omnipresent.\n \n\n   \n  “The landscape is going to shift,” said Evans, “But, overall, if you like interview shows, you have certainly tons of options, and I think at a higher quality now than 10 years ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Evans celebrates the growth of the niche from “barren, empty shelves” to a marketplace filled with great offerings, but he also acknowledges the concerns that it might be too much, conceding that audience fatigue is plausible in the midst of what he described as the “boom times” of the genre.\n \n\n   \n  Moore said that no matter how famous a host or a guest is, or how elaborate and slick a production is, an unauthentic product will not resonate with audiences.\n \n\n   \n  Colker echoed the sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  “These types of appearances only fatigue clients when they start to feel repetitive or disconnected from their story,” Colker said. “The sweet spot is where creativity meets comfort and when it feels natural, not performative.”\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY’s approach to content creation has always centered the fans as its North Star, which they try to follow through endless trial and error, as well as excruciating analysis of audience metrics. This includes an examination of the kinds of brands and celebrities JOLLY looks to associate with, the best platforms to reach their audience and even the lengths of videos.\n \n\n   \n  “The focus for us has been: Can we make good content that people want to see?” Kendal said, “We’re not really interested in doing content for content’s sake.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether food-themed interviews have reached their inflection point, let alone oversaturation, is yet to be determined. For now, the proof is in the pudding as more online creators and legacy media outlets continue to add to the loaded pantry of this genre.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, Vogue revived an infrequent online cooking segment under a new title,  Now Serving.  YouTuber Quenlin Blackwell’s rebranded her FEEDING STARVING INFLUENCERS series to now feature celebrities. And across the pond, broadcaster Nick Grimshaw and Michelin star chef Angela Hartnett launched  Dish,  where celebrities enjoy conversations over one of Hartnett’s acclaimed creations.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, other creators and outlets have seemingly started to  abandon the concept. Harper’s BAZAAR’s online series,  Food Diaries , was abruptly discontinued in 2023 after a six-year run, and internet personality, Joey Camasta, concluded his raunchy take on the concept after only one season of  Could I Get in Your Pantry?  \n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Hearst and Camasta for comment.\n \n\n   \n  But as long as the media climate provides the perfect temperature for these shows to grow and expand, and until audiences are satiated to the point of nausea, creators will continue to cook up fresh ideas.\n \n\n   \n  Carrott and Kendal are already manifesting their dream episodes: southern biscuits and gravy versus English tea and biscuits with Matthew McConaughey, and going through the Waffle House menu with Prince Harry.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s kind of a perfect example of what we want to achieve,” said Carrott. “Sharing culture and authentic passion over a meal with someone.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/us/new-york-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"10:56:00-05:00","title":"Rockefeller Center Christmas tree arrives in Manhattan, kicking off New York’s holiday season","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, a 75-foot Norway spruce from East Greenbush, New York, was hoisted at 30 Rockefeller Plaza on November 9, 2025, marking the official start of New York City’s holiday season.

They might walk and talk through a busy street or store. There’s a warm camera filter, and quick cuts, as they move rapid-fire through a list of talking points and policies.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at how some Democrats are producing content echoing the Mamdani style.\n \n\n   \n    The Mamdani aesthetic\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s videos are instantly recognizable by the saturated colors that help them stand out on social feeds crowded with content.\n \n\n   \n  The videos are also characterized by quick cuts and big gestures — a tendency Mamdani joked about in one spot: “My team says I move my hands too much,” he  says .\n \n\n   \n  It’s an aesthetic that’s worked for other Democrats, including a pair of progressives in Michigan’s Democratic Senate primary.\n \n\n   \n  Former Detroit public health official Abdul El-Sayed scored a hit with a video using burgers to illustrate billionaire excess, similar to a Mamdani video that used mango lassis to explain New York’s ranked choice voting system. And state Sen. Mallory McMorrow earned her own viral moment with a video highlighting grocery prices, calling to mind Mamdani’s bodega tours.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Mamo, a Democratic strategist advising McMorrow and Texas state Rep. James Talarico, another 2026 US Senate contender, underscored the importance of visually engaging content.\n \n\n   \n  “Understand that you’re not just competing against the other Democrats in the primary. You’re not just competing against the Republicans,” Mamo explained. “You are competing against dog videos and sports highlights and Netflix on your other television and someone FaceTiming you and your group chat for attention on your phone and on your laptop and on your iPad.”\n \n\n   \n    The substance: affordability\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s campaign insists that its relentless focus on affordability was equally important to the success. “The style is downstream from the substance,” said Andrew Epstein, a top campaign aide.\n \n\n   \n  “Unless you have a message and an agenda that is directly relevant to people’s lives that speaks to the economic conditions in this country, that credibly presents itself as an alternative to this incredibly broken status quo and the alienation that so many people feel from mainstream politics — it’s not going to work,” Epstein said.\n \n\n   \n  Roxie Richner, El-Sayed’s communications director, echoed the Mamdani team’s emphasis on the issues.\n \n\n   \n  “I think at the end of the day, what resonates with people is the substance,” Richner said, pointing to one of El-Sayed’s  videos  in which “he explained the privatization of the Bay City bridges in Bay City, Michigan, in a way that people understood and that maybe folks in other parts of the state weren’t aware of it.”\n \n\n   \n  And while many politicians have taken to addressing voters’ concerns about affordability, strategists pointed to the importance of getting specific, exemplified by Mamdani’s focus on everyday pressure points like rents and bus fares.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not the affordability crisis in this country — it’s, ‘I need new deodorant and it’s $13.99, when did deodorant get to be $13.99?” Mamo said. “If you’re sitting in a bar, that is how you would say that. And if you’re on video, you should say it the same way, if you’re explaining it to your neighbor or a stranger at the bar, it’s the same way you should talk on camera.”\n \n\n   \n    Emulation, not imitation\n \n\n   \n  Soon after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary this summer, rival Andrew Cuomo began producing videos in which he was walking and talking in soft-filter video. Mamdani’s team noticed.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean, I want to say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but in Andrew’s case, I think it’s a lot more pathetic than that, frankly,” Epstein said.\n \n\n   \n  Other strategists underlined the importance of authenticity in campaign communications, with candidates across the country from different backgrounds facing a diverse array of issues.\n \n\n   \n  “It has to be real to you,” Mamo said, pointing to the example of California Sen. Adam Schiff. “He’s a lawyer, a professor and an explainer. So their videos are lawyer-professor-explainer, Adam Schiff, lawyer-professor- explaining what’s going on in Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  And Richner with El-Sayed’s campaign in Michigan said  Tuesday’s election results  demonstrated the party’s need for talented communicators.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether it was bringing down utility prices in New Jersey, or it was making buses faster and free in New York, I think people are suffering in this moment, and they want to believe that things can be better, and they need leaders and messengers that can show them that,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/syrian-migrants-germany-repatriation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"08:39:00-05:00","title":"Syrian Migrants in Germany Face Uncertain Future as Government Floats Repatriation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Germany, which welcomed over 1.3 million Syrian refugees during the 2015–2016 refugee crisis under Chancellor Angela Merkel, is now facing a sharp policy shift under Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Merz and his conservative coalition have initiated discussions on repatriating Syrian migrants, suggesting voluntary returns or deportations for those who refuse, citing the fall of Assad’s regime as a reason to rebuild Syria. However, the plan faces significant legal, social, and political challenges — including the fact that only 1,300 Syrians have voluntarily returned since 2015, and many Syrians hold temporary residence permits or citizenship, making their future uncertain. Critics, including the Green Party, aid organizations, and Syrian activists, argue that mass deportations are impractical and could harm the integration of skilled workers, such as Syrian doctors who are vital to Germany’s healthcare system. The debate is also politically charged, as the far-right AfD has gained momentum by promoting anti-immigration and anti-Islamic rhetoric, using Syrian repatriation as a key platform. While Merz aims to counter the AfD’s influence, the proposal raises serious ethical and humanitarian concerns about the future of Syrian migrants who have built lives and families in Germany.","keyTakeAways":["Germany has received approximately 1.3 million Syrian migrants since 2015, with over 160,000 gaining German citizenship by 2023.","Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his

     8:39 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Germany opened its doors to refugees escaping war in the Middle East, more people arrived from Syria than any other country – finding homes, getting jobs, starting families.\n \n\n   \n  A question mark now hangs over their future, after Germany’s government – which has  hardened its stance  on immigration amid a surging far right – suggested it could be time for some to return home, voluntarily or not.\n \n\n   \n  Some 1 million Syrians arrived in Germany at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015-2016,  under former chancellor  Angela Merkel. Approximately 1.3 million live in Germany currently, including 25,000 who were born there.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Chancellor Friedrich Merz and other conservatives in his coalition cabinet are calling for their repatriation.\n \n\n   \n  Merz this week said that Berlin would approach the issue in a “very concrete matter,” as he signaled that there are “no longer any grounds for asylum in Germany, and therefore we can also begin with repatriations.”\n \n\n   \n  While the German government will first and foremost encourage voluntary repatriation, Merz said those who refuse “can, of course, also be deported in the near future,” as he said that the return of Syrians to their homeland would be key to rebuilding the war-torn country.\n \n\n   \n  The German chancellor also revealed he has invited Syrian President  Ahmad al-Sharaa  to Berlin to discuss the issue.\n \n\n   \n  What’s changed in Syria is that the Assad government  is no more , bringing an end to years of civil war. And in Germany, Merz’s coalition is trying to fend off the far-right  Alternative for Germany (AfD)  party.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Merz’s rhetoric, it remains unclear at this stage how wide-reaching deportations would be. Germany has so far only announced plans to deport Syrians with criminal records.\n \n\n   \n  Since the collapse of Assad’s regime, around 1,300 Syrians – or 0.1% - have voluntarily returned to their homeland, according to Germany’s interior ministry.\n \n\n   \n  Syrians live in Germany under varying legal statuses – some have been granted German citizenship, while others hold permanent residence permits. Over 160,000 Syrians had obtained German citizenship by the end of 2023, Deutsche Welle reported. Those who fall into these categories will not need to leave Germany, CDU politicians said during a coalition debate on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands more hold temporary residence permits, which they are granted after receiving a protection status, such as asylum, refugee or subsidiary protection, which applies when neither of the former can be granted and serious harm is threatened in the country of origin.\n \n\n   \n  Temporary residence permits allow foreigners to live and work in Germany, as well as receive government benefits, but mean their ability to remain there is uncertain.\n \n\n   \n  The issue of repatriation is contentious and comes with significant legal hurdles. Meanwhile Syria remains scarred by years of conflict and nationals in Germany are looking on at the debate with mounting worry.\n \n\n   \n  “Merz’s comments are heading in a direction that fuels right-wing desires to deport anyone who doesn’t fit their so-called idea of who belongs in Germany and that’s terrifying,” said Rafif Dawoud, a 33-year-old architect living in Berlin, who migrated from Syria over 12 years ago and is now a German citizen.\n \n\n   \n  Dawoud said that while she knows people who have willingly returned, “talking about sending back people who have been trying to integrate, who see Germany as their second or even first and only home, who actively contribute to this society and economy, well that’s an absolute disgrace.”\n \n\n   \n  Others are concerned about a volatile political situation back home. A retired engineer, who currently lives in Germany but does not hold citizenship, described the overthrow of Assad’s government as a “historical necessity” while questioning its replacement.\n \n\n   \n  “We must ask whether the country is moving toward a state that mirrors European and specifically German values, respecting freedoms and human principles, or whether dictatorship and a new totalitarian religious system are simply being reproduced under a different name,” the man, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Since Assad’s ousting, Syria has  seen flare-ups  of deadly sectarian violence, with clashes erupting between security forces and those loyal to the former president, including in Syria’s coastal Latakia region in March.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN, Akram al-Bunni, a Syrian political activist who was jailed under Assad’s regime, said the German government must take into consideration the nature of the country’s new authority, which he believes could expose many Syrians to new persecution. The security situation must also be considered, al-Bunni said, stating that weapons remain “uncontrolled in the hands of extremist factions.”\n \n\n   \n  Johann Wadephul, Germany’s foreign minister and a politician in Merz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), hinted at some of the problems awaiting Syrians on a recent visit to  Damascus , when he compared the country’s devastation to “images we saw from Germany in 1945 after World War II” and expressed doubt that large numbers of Syrian migrants would return voluntarily.\n \n\n   \n  But after receiving backlash from within his own party over the comments, Wadephul has sought to stress that his overall view remains in alignment with his party.\n \n\n   \n  Other politicians, particularly on Germany’s left, have criticized the plans. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Lamya Kaddor, of Germany’s Green Party, said “to believe that mass deportations (to Syria) are now possible underestimates the reality on the ground.”\n \n\n   \n  The Association of German-Syrian Aid Organizations has spoken out against the government’s plans, with its chairman Nahla Osman saying the debate represents a huge blow for Syrians who have integrated into German society, including skilled workers, in a recent interview with Deutschlandfunk radio.\n \n\n   \n  Germany’s health sector, for example, employs over 6,000 Syrian doctors, according to official figures – making them an integral part of the country’s healthcare system. Late last year, then-Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned “whole areas” in Germany’s healthcare sector would fall away if the Syrians who worked there currently were to leave.\n \n\n   \n    Countering the far right\n \n\n   \n  Despite the opposition, it is clear that the days of “Wilkommenskulture” or “welcoming culture” regarding immigration to Germany under Merkel are gone.\n \n\n   \n  The  AfD  came second in Germany’s federal election in February, securing an unprecedented number of votes after campaigning on an anti-migration platform and a manifesto that states that “Islam does not belong in Germany.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the collapse of the Assad regime, the AfD has been calling for Syrians in Germany to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, the party has continued to enjoy strong popularity, even temporarily surging ahead of the CDU in some polls, leaving Merz’s government fighting to retain ground.\n \n\n   \n  Merz – who had long been a critic of Merkel’s open-door policies – has taken a tougher stance on migration, in part to counter the AfD.\n \n\n   \n  While his predecessor welcomed migrants into Germany under the slogan “Wir schaffen das” – “We’ll manage it,” Merz and his government  announced sweeping revisions  to migration policy after taking office.\n \n\n   \n  “We clearly did not manage it. That is exactly why we’re trying to fix it,” he said of the situation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/trump-foreign-leader-meetings","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump meets with more foreign leaders as GOP grapples with election losses and a shuttered government","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump continues to prioritize foreign diplomacy, hosting leaders from Central Asia, Hungary, Syria, and numerous other countries, while the Republican Party faces domestic political fallout from poor performance in off-year elections and a prolonged government shutdown.

meets with more foreign leaders as GOP grapples with election losses and a shuttered government \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As Republicans were casting about for explanations for  their party’s dismal showing  in off-year elections last week,  President Donald Trump  had several other pieces of business to attend to.\n \n\n   \n  He hosted Central Asian leaders for dinner at the White House on Thursday. A day later, the 38th day of the government shutdown, Hungary’s authoritarian prime minister came for lunch. On Monday, Syria’s president will make a historic visit to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Among the topics the president spent time in public discussing last week: migration policies in Europe, commercial activity on the Caspian Sea, South Africa’s position in the G20, and the energy limitations presented by Hungary’s geography (“They don’t have the advantage of having sea,” he explained). He  hasn’t met  with congressional leadership about the record-long shutdown or offered any constructive solutions, instead digging in on the  filibuster elimination  that’s a nonstarter on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  Ten months into his new administration, Trump has placed much of his attention on foreign affairs as he works to end conflicts, secure trade agreements and burnish a presidential peacemaking legacy. World leaders pass through the White House weekly, and the president has made three foreign trips just since September.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an approach that’s yielded successes, particularly in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire the president helped broker in Gaza. But as Republicans look to improve their prospects a year out from critical midterm elections, even some of Trump’s allies are beginning to wonder whether his attention abroad is obscuring the “America First” identity he’s spent years building.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re not going to convince them to go to the polls and vote by bailing out Argentina. And you’re not going to convince them to go to the polls and vote by continuing to fund foreign wars and foreign countries and foreign causes,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said last week on CNN. “You’re going to get them to go to the polls and vote, when you show up to work, and actually fix the problems that they face every single day.”\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia Republican has of late become more critical of some of Trump’s tactics, though she still describes herself as a stalwart supporter. Yet she is hardly alone in questioning whether his attention might be better focused at home, and in particular on the economy, rather than on his endeavors overseas.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s having a lot of success with world leaders, and they all respect him,” one Trump adviser said. “He’s focusing where he’s successful. But people know it doesn’t motivate anyone to vote.”\n \n\n   \n  Even Vice President JD Vance said last week that domestic matters should be a priority.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to focus on the home front,” he wrote on X the day after the election, adding: “We’re going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that’s the metric by which we’ll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House said Trump remained focused on cost questions.\n \n\n   \n  “Addressing Joe Biden’s inflation crisis has been a Day One priority for President Trump, who has already lowered prices for essentials like gas and eggs and cooled inflation to an annualized 2.5 percent rate — half the average inflation rate under Joe Biden,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “As the Administration’s robust economic agenda continues taking effect, Americans can count on real wages continuing to increase, investments to make and hire in American continuing to flow in, and for Joe Biden’s lackluster economy to firmly become a distant memory.”\n \n\n   \n  A  CNN survey  released last week found only 1% of adult Americans named foreign policy as the most important issue facing the country; 47% said the economy and cost of living. Trump’s international efforts also did not receive high marks: 56% of respondents said his foreign policy decisions have hurt America’s standing in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the world stage has become something of a welcome respite for the president from the humdrum realities of governing in Washington. Last month in Asia, the president was met with extravagant welcomes, gold gifts and rapid-pace announcement of new trade and peace deals. It was a stark contrast to the atmosphere he left and returned to: gridlocked discussions to reopen the shuttered federal government and growing voter anxiety about an uncertain economy.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has argued Trump’s global efforts are intertwined with his domestic ambitions. His tariff regime, which forms the backbone of his foreign policy, is intended in part to restore American manufacturing and reduce the US trade deficit.\n \n\n   \n  But in many ways, the criticism from the president’s allies is not about policy but about the impression Trump is spending far more time meeting foreign leaders or flying around the world than he is attending to economic problems at home.\n \n\n   \n  “Keeping him on nonstop tours around the world and nonstop meetings with foreign countries’ leaders is not America First. It’s just not,” Greene said. “I think domestic policy should be the most important issue that the president and the Republican-controlled House and Senate are working on, and that showed up in the election on Tuesday.”\n \n\n   \n  It is not uncommon for presidents, in their second terms, to turn attention to foreign policy. Without the burden of another reelection campaign, leaders often have a freer hand to focus on issues not necessarily front of mind for voters. Diplomacy can also be an easier occupation for a lame-duck commander in chief than sweeping domestic efforts, which often require congressional buy-in.\n \n\n   \n  Presidential legacies are often forged in the drama of the world stage, such as Ronald Reagan demanding Mikhail Gorbachev tear down the Berlin Wall or Barack Obama making a historic visit to Cuba. Trump, too, views his peacemaking efforts as critical to his place in the history books, according to aides, and he openly jockeys for a Nobel Peace Price.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, however, the dynamics of his second term are different. He ran for president last year not as an incumbent, but as a challenger seeking to oust the sitting commander in chief. His campaign focused heavily on promises of an economic turnaround for struggling Americans, not the pursuit of a Nobel prize.\n \n\n   \n  When the candidate did make promises about foreign affairs, he often set the bar unattainably high. His pledge to end the war in Ukraine within a day of taking office proved impossible to meet, and he later claimed it was made facetiously.\n \n\n   \n  Since returning to office in January, Trump has hosted at the White House the leaders of Hungary, Ukraine, Argentina, Finland, Canada, Israel, Turkey, Poland, Korea, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Philippines, Bahrain, Congo, Rwanda, Pakistan, Germany, South Africa, Norway, Italy, El Salvador, Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, India, Jordan and Japan. Some have visited multiple times.\n \n\n   \n  He’s also convened summits of leaders from Europe, Africa and Central Asia, and gathered Arab and Muslim leaders at the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  This year, he’s traveled abroad to Italy, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Israel, Egypt, Malaysia, Japan and South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  While the pace of meetings and travel is steady, it does not put Trump on a more rapid pace than his predecessors, or even himself. During his first year in office in 2017, Trump received 35 heads of state for official visits. In 2013, the first year of Obama’s second term, 34 foreign leaders came to the United States for official visits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump visited 13 countries in 2017. And Obama visited 12 in 2013.\n \n\n   \n  President Joe Biden traveled at a slower pace during his first year in office, as the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic lingered, and in his final year, as he tried to turn attention to his reelection campaign. But the intervening years saw him visit roughly the same number of countries as Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Biden, too, struggled to balance domestic matters with the two foreign conflicts that came to consume the end of his presidency. And one point in 2023, he estimated 75% of his job was spent dealing with foreign leaders and traveling the world. Aides later blamed intensive foreign travel for the disastrous debate performance that precipitated his withdrawal from the race.\n \n\n   \n  Other presidents have also found that focusing abroad — at the expense of addressing Americans’ economic pain — yields little political return. George H.W. Bush oversaw the end of the Cold War and the first Gulf War, but voters were more concerned with high unemployment and inflation — a disparity his rival Democratic Bill Clinton seized upon when he ran and defeated him.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/climate/paris-agreement-anniversary-cop30","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"09:05:00-05:00","title":"It’s been a dangerous decade since the Paris Climate Agreement, but there’s still reason for hope","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A decade after the Paris Climate Agreement was adopted in 2015, the world remains on a dangerous trajectory with rising emissions and intensified climate disasters.

Sutter\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:05 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A decade ago, the world got together and decided to fix the climate crisis by adopting the Paris Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  I remember it like yesterday. This was December 2015 at the UN climate talks in Paris. I was standing in front of a CNN camera as the news came through an earpiece: Nearly every country on Earth agrees to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 — holding warming short of catastrophic levels. A hilariously on-the-nose green gavel hit a desk. The convention center erupted in applause. Diplomats wept and hugged. Even Al Gore managed to not look all that wooden.\n \n\n   \n  My column the next morning trumpeted this headline: “ This is the end of fossil fuels .”\n \n\n   \n  Somehow, it doesn’t feel like 10 years and some 300 gigatons of carbon have floated by since then.\n \n\n   \n  Paris was not the end of fossil fuels, of course. From the perspective of the atmosphere, the last decade could accurately be described as a slow-moving fever dream — one in which pollution from fossil fuels has continued to rise year after year. All those emissions drive global heating and make the planet more dangerous.\n \n\n   \n  And in this dangerous decade climate disasters have continued to intensify — from the massive hurricane that  walloped Puerto Rico in 2017 , to Jamaica this October where  the most powerful Atlantic storm  on record came aground.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a decade in which  new fossil fuel projects continued to be approved  by the very governments that had promised to slash emissions; and one in which the United States twice elected a climate-denier to the nation’s highest office. This fall, US President Donald Trump, after  cancelling billions toward clean energy projects  and  moving to open a swath of the Arctic for oil extraction , bucked the scientific consensus on global warming again by falsely stating that climate change is the “ greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world. ”\n \n\n   \n  Ironic, then, that this has also been a decade during which scientists realized that, if anything,  they underestimated some of the threats of climate change .\n \n\n   \n  Just last month, for example, researchers reported that Earth had crossed one of  its first climate tipping points , with such a massive percentage of coral reefs struggling amid warming that we’re entering a “new reality” in which those reefs won’t be able to recover.\n \n\n   \n  One key goal of the Paris Agreement was to prevent this sort of thing, by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. A group of especially climate-vulnerable countries, calling themselves the  High Ambition Coalition , banded together to push for that target. In Paris, delegates carried the rhyming theme over to wearing buttons that said, “1.5 to stay alive,” a reference to the existential threat warming poses, especially to low-lying areas that are flooding as ice melts and oceans rise.\n \n\n   \n  That “1.5 to stay alive” target, we now know, is almost certainly out of reach. Either  we’ve crossed that line already  or  we’re well on the way . Does that mean we’re “dead”? That we’ve failed to “stay alive”?\n \n\n   \n  No — thankfully, the world doesn’t burst into flames at 1.51 degrees of warming.\n \n\n   \n  We do know that every ton of heat-trapping pollution makes the world more dangerous. But, conversely, every ton of it we save makes the world safer for future generations. Yes, by many metrics, we’ve backslid in the years since Paris. Jamie Henn, co-founder of 350.org and director of Fossil Free Media, told me that if climate action is  Star Wars  then “I think we’re in the  Empire Strikes Back  episode of the trilogy” — where it all falls apart.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s still possible to adjust the lens and bring other storylines into focus.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve come an incredibly long way since Paris,” said Jean Su, energy justice director and senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. Of note, Su told me, is the fact that world leaders in 2023, at the COP meeting in Dubai,  added language to the Paris Agreement  that calls for moving away from fossil fuels. At that meeting, “we really reached a pinnacle in terms of addressing the root causes of the climate emergency,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Just because Trump thinks climate change is a scam, doesn’t mean the rest of the world agrees.\n \n\n   \n  Henn, the climate activist, pointed to renewable energy as a bright spot. In the first half of 2025,  renewables overtook coal  as the world’s top energy source for the first time. Wind and solar power — which don’t produce the heat-trapping pollution of coal and gas — are  expected to meet 90% of new electricity demand  this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The transition is moving  even faster than people predicted back in 2015 ,” Henn said.  Fifteen times faster , in fact, if you’re looking at solar power installations, according to the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, it continues to be crystal clear how the public feels about this issue: 89% of the global public  surveyed in a 2024 study  favored stronger political action on climate change.\n \n\n   \n  “That is a supermajority,” said Mark Hertsgaard, executive director of Covering Climate Now, the group behind a media collaboration called the  89 Percent Project . “And it’s a [super]majority that doesn’t know that it’s a majority. People in that majority think that they’re 29% of the population. They think they’re a minority.”\n \n\n   \n  But even in the United States, positive trends hold: 79% of registered voters  surveyed in May 2025  said they support the US being part of the Paris Agreement and 75% support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant.\n \n\n   \n  Climate advocates are planning new efforts to make use of this supermajority. Among them is a push for a  Fossil Fuel Nonproliferation Treaty . Alex Rafalowicz, executive director of that initiative, told me the idea for a treaty builds on an  International Court of Justice decision earlier this year  that held nations legally responsible for curbing climate-heating pollution.\n \n\n   \n  “The economics do demonstrate that the transition [to clean energy sources] has an inevitability about it,” Rafalowicz said. “But the question is whether it is fast enough, and whether it is fair enough. That is part of the problem we’re trying to solve.”\n \n\n   \n  A meeting about that treaty is likely to happen next spring in Colombia, he said. Meanwhile, the UN is prepping for COP30, in Brazil, which begins November 10. Plenty of the delegates there will remember that green gavel moment from Paris. I’ll be thinking of it as I watch news from the summit, too.\n \n\n   \n  On the day the Paris Agreement was adopted, I spent hours with the delegation from the Marshall Islands, a nation of low-lying islands in the Pacific that fears being subsumed by rising seas. I’d visited the country earlier in 2015 for a CNN article. I’ll never forget a woman telling me that the sound of the ocean, which used to lull her to sleep, had become threatening after waves crashed through her home and flooded it. Her family had decided to move to Arkansas to get far away from the water and that sound.\n \n\n   \n  The Marshallese delegation in Paris gave me a palm frond ribbon to remember them by. I kept it in my pocket as I relayed news of the agreement to viewers around the world.\n \n\n   \n  It’s sitting on my desk as I type this, 10 years later.\n \n\n   \n  It reminds me that the optimism and the urgency of that moment have not been forgotten.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/ups-crash-fleets-grounded-investigation-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"08:05:00+00:00","title":"FAA halts flights of MD-11 cargo planes and requires inspections after UPS plane crash leaves community in mourning","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS MD-11 cargo plane crashed during takeoff at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on November 4, 2025, killing at least 14 people and causing a massive fire that destroyed businesses including Grade A Auto Parts.

Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    MD-11s grounded ‘out of an abundance of caution’\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, the cargo plane’s engine and the pylon, which supports the engine, fell off the left wing of UPS flight 2976 as it accelerated for takeoff, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have yet to determine why it happened, but operators are erring on the side of caution until answers emerge.\n \n\n   \n  “Out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of safety, we have made the decision to temporarily ground our MD-11,” UPS said in a statement. “Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.”\n \n\n   \n  McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft are used exclusively for cargo operations and make up about 9% of the UPS fleet. The company said it had contingency plans to temporarily operate without them.\n \n\n   \n  FedEx, the only other major US airline to operate the MD-11, will also ground them for “a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The decisions come after recommendations from Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997.\n \n\n   \n  The UPS freighter that crashed was a  34-year-old jet.  While that may be considered old for a passenger plane, that’s not so unusual in the world of air cargo and there are no initial indications that the age of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was in any way a factor in the  fatal crash .\n \n\n   \n    NTSB is still investigating the cause\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB will release a preliminary report within 30 days, but it could be 18 to 24 months before the investigation concludes, according to  Jim Brauchle , an aviation attorney with law firm Motley Rice and former US Air Force navigator.\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorders and the engine and pylon that fell off the airplane’s wing have been moved to a secure facility, where they are being examined, NTSB investigator Todd Inman said during a news conference Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The  engine was found lying on the ground  and will help investigators determine what may have caused the crash, according to CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s a huge clue and does give the (NTSB) a pretty good idea of what started this all off,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  The  engine coming off the plane  before the final impact and the fireball that followed suggest an “uncontained engine failure, meaning the engine spews out parts,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible pieces flying off of one failing engine could have impacted other key parts of the plane, and the engine likely ruptured the wing fuel tank when it ripped from the plane, she added.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have also recovered two hours of clear cockpit audio from the UPS cargo plane that confirmed the crew completed standard checklists and takeoff briefings, Inman said, before what he described what began as an “uneventful” takeoff roll.\n \n\n   \n  The transcript of the recording will be released to the public in several months, once most of the agency’s reports are completed, Inman said.\n \n\n   \n  Inman also confirmed the aircraft had recently undergone a heavy maintenance check in San Antonio, and clarified earlier reports of the plane reaching 475 feet were inaccurate. Data now shows the jet only climbed to about 100 feet above ground level before crashing.\n \n\n   \n  “The maintenance will be the big issue — what exactly was done to the aircraft, who did it, what parts were replaced, what procedures were followed, and who inspected the work,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators will be particularly interested in which engines or other parts may have been removed or replaced during maintenance, she added.\n \n\n   \n    A lawsuit has been filed on behalf of impacted victims and businesses\n \n\n   \n  Residents living near the crash site and local businesses facing significant economic losses who suffered emotional distress have filed a lawsuit against UPS, Boeing and General Electric.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs accuse the companies of recklessness and negligence, which “upended the lives and livelihoods” of many in the Louisville community, according to the complaint, filed in US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit alleges the Boeing McDonnell Douglas MD-11 crash was preventable and the defendants must be held accountable for the “trauma, fear and uncertainty” their actions have caused, according to the complaint, filed by the law firm Morgan & Morgan.\n \n\n   \n  A Boeing spokesperson told CNN the company has no comment about the lawsuit but said it is supporting NTSB’s investigation and extends its condolences to the families and friends of the victims.\n \n\n   \n  “Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved,” a UPS spokesperson told CNN. “We do not comment on pending litigation.”\n \n\n   \n  General Electric did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “This tragedy has needlessly shattered the lives of many in the Louisville community,” attorneys Mike Morgan, Rene Rocha, and Tanner Shultz said in a statement. “We are committed to uncovering the truth and will stop at nothing to achieve justice.”\n \n\n   \n  The suit also highlights the troubled safety record of Boeing’s MD-11 aircraft, calling it one of the most accident-prone commercial planes still in service. The filing cites past crashes, including a fatal 2009 FedEx MD-11 crash in Tokyo, and alleges similar design flaws or defects in Boeing’s MD-11 may have caused or contributed to the November 4 crash.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs argued UPS’ own modifications to convert the plane into a cargo model could have played a role. The complaint further points to GE’s CF6 engines, which have been involved in multiple catastrophic incidents, as another potential factor in the disaster.\n \n\n   \n    Loved ones of missing victims are losing hope\n \n\n   \n  The fire came first with a plume of red flames and black smoke twisting through the sunset. Then came the screams.\n \n\n   \n  Officials don’t believe it’s likely there are any more survivors, and the number of fatalities linked to the crash is expected to stand at 14, Mayor Craig Greenberg announced Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Search and rescue teams have located 13 victims, matching the number of missing persons reports related to the crash filed with police, Greenberg said in a video posted to  X . The 14th victim died at the hospital Saturday, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The plane crashed into Grade A Auto Parts, an automotive part and recycling facility, where three employees  are still unaccounted for. \n \n\n   \n  “It looked like really hell’s fury around her,” CEO Sean Garber recalled, describing a video he saw showing a “huge fireball” engulfing his business as his employees screamed and ran from the flames.\n \n\n   \n  Among the missing employees is John Loucks, a 52-year-old beloved uncle who worked on and off at Grade A Auto Parts for at least a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s scary really,” his nephew Justin Loucks told CNN. “Did he die on impact?

Shouldn’t it be suspended and reorganized?”\n \n\n   \n  The chain’s rapid expansion in recent years – alongside bigger local coffee makers such as Luckin Coffee – highlights rising demand for a brew in the nation of 1.4 billion people, traditionally dominated by tea.\n \n\n   \n  The market has also become increasingly cut-throat with cheaper options from local makers squeezing foreign chains such as Starbucks, once a symbol of status and Western influence in a more affluent China.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, the Seattle-founded coffee giant  announced  that it would sell the controlling stake of its more than 8,000 outlets in China to a local investment firm.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/aca-enrollment-premiums-increase-impact","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Skyrocketing ACA Premiums Force Enrollees to Make Tough Decisions","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rising ACA premiums and the impending expiration of enhanced subsidies are forcing millions of Americans to make life-altering decisions, from dropping coverage to forgoing medical care.

Her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, told her that the monthly premiums for her Affordable Care Act policy  would soar  to $1,380 next year, up from $862.\n \n\n   \n  Wick, 57, currently gets $400 in  federal premium subsidies , which makes the monthly cost of her health insurance more manageable. But the Arlington, Texas, resident is not counting on that assistance for next year since she also received a letter from the federal Obamacare exchange saying she likely won’t be eligible for any help in 2026 if the enhanced subsidies expire as scheduled at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  The  rising health insurance rates  and lapsing subsidies could upend Wick’s life. A therapist who focuses on sexual assault survivors, she launched a full-time private practice earlier this year but depends on Obamacare coverage since she has preexisting medical conditions. However, having to pay three times her current tab is unaffordable and could force her to give up her practice and find a job that offers health benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “Health insurance will determine what my life will look like, whether or not I can continue with my private practice,” said Wick, who ruminates over the situation before she goes to sleep and when she’s out for her daily walks.\n \n\n   \n    Agonizing tradeoffs\n \n\n   \n  Wick is among the millions of Americans with Affordable Care Act policies who must contend with the looming lapse of the enhanced subsidies. The increased cost of coverage can lead to agonizing trade-offs for many enrollees, including cutting back on other necessities, trying to avoid getting care or forgoing health insurance entirely.\n \n\n   \n  The issue is  at the center  of the stalemate on Capitol Hill, which has led to a record federal government shutdown. Democrats say they will only support a federal funding package for fiscal year 2026 if it also extends the more generous assistance, but Republicans say they will only negotiate after the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  The enhanced subsidies have enabled many lower-income Americans to obtain coverage with no or very low monthly premiums and broadened eligibility for assistance to many middle-class consumers. Obamacare’s original subsidies, which are part of the 2010 health reform law and are not expiring, are only available to those who earn less than four times the federal poverty level, or about $63,000 for an individual and $129,000 for a family of four.\n \n\n   \n  Enacted by a Democratic-led Congress during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, the extra assistance helped spur a record 24 million people to sign up for Obamacare policies this year, with many new enrollees hailing from states that voted for President Donald Trump in 2024. More than 90% of policyholders receive subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The expiring beefed-up subsidies, along with rising health care costs, contributed to insurers hiking rates by 26%, on average, for next year, according to federal data.\n \n\n   \n  But what enrollees will actually pay will be far higher because they won’t have the additional aid. Premium payments will more than double, on average, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.\n \n\n   \n  Certain policyholders will be hit harder than others. Those with incomes just above the poverty level will go from paying $0 or nearly $0 in premiums to being on the hook for a few hundred dollars a year, said Cynthia Cox, KFF’s director of the Program on the ACA. Nearly half of enrollees are in this group.\n \n\n   \n  “For them, it’s a lot of money,” Cox said. “It may be a big enough increase that they feel they can’t afford it.”\n \n\n   \n  Also, enrollees in their 50s and early 60s, who already pay a lot for coverage, will have to shell out even more. An older couple making $85,000 a year could see their premiums skyrocket by more than $20,000 a year, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to imagine that many of them will be able to afford to continue that coverage,” Cox said.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the situation that Sunni Montgomery finds herself in.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I have fought this so hard. I want to live.’\n \n\n   \n  At 63, Montgomery is facing a relentless battle with lung cancer. Since 2022, she’s undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, relying on her ACA marketplace plan to cover the mounting costs. Thanks to enhanced subsidies, her premium this year was $541 a month — just manageable with Social Security Disability and a part-time job.\n \n\n   \n  But next year, without those subsidies, she says her premium is set to soar to $1,758 a month — far outside her budget.\n \n\n   \n  “I have to face the reality that I am probably going to become a late-stage cancer patient who’s uninsured,” Montgomery said. “I have fought this so hard. I want to live.”\n \n\n   \n  Now on daily oxygen and getting scans every three months, she says she’s at high risk for recurrence. Without insurance, those lifesaving treatments will be out of reach.\n \n\n   \n  “If I’m not getting scans and we don’t know if something’s recurred, then what that can mean is the end of me,” said Montgomery, who is racing to squeeze in every scan and checkup she can before her coverage expires.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Chris and Donna Vetter have made the agonizing decision to drop their health insurance, saying they simply cannot afford it.\n \n\n   \n  Chris, 62, is a retired federal worker, and Donna, 60, runs a small medical billing business. They relied on their ACA plan — reduced to $401 a month by the enhanced subsidies — to manage Donna’s asthma and Chris’ atrial fibrillation. But next year, their premium is set to skyrocket to $1,975 a month — nearly half their income.\n \n\n   \n  They pored over options on the ACA marketplace but say even the cheapest plans hovered near $1,000 a month. Yet those policies “have huge deductibles, big copays, and they don’t cover a lot, so effectively it’s like not having insurance anyways,” Chris said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Vetters, who live in rural Somerset County, Maryland, are bracing for a future without coverage — expecting to cancel appointments, forgo screenings, skip medications, and cross their fingers that disaster doesn’t strike.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just scared, and I don’t know what to do,” Donna said. “If anything should go wrong — God forbid a car accident, heart attack, cancer — we’ll have nothing.”\n \n\n   \n    Planning for the unexpected\n \n\n   \n  Soaring premiums have also left Alison and her husband, Chris, who live in Carson City, Nevada, debating over what to do about their Obamacare coverage. They began buying policies on the exchange three years ago, when Chris, a former police officer, had to retire after a serious injury.\n \n\n   \n  This year, they are paying only $183 a month after nearly $1,350 in subsidies. But next year, their policy will cost $936 after some subsidies. They are contemplating buying a less expensive plan with a much higher deductible, though that will force them to think twice about going to urgent care or the emergency room.\n \n\n   \n  “Just to even be in a situation where you have to think about, well, do I really need it? Do I really need that medication? Do I really need to go to the urgent care? God forbid, do I really need to go to the ER or can I, for lack of a better word, suck it up?” said Alison, who asked that only her first name be used because of her husband’s former profession. “I mean those are all decisions that we’re going to be forced to have to make.”\n \n\n   \n  Younger Americans are also grappling with the increased costs.\n \n\n   \n  Kris McKegney, 23, now pays $300 a month after subsidies for a higher-end plan with only a $3,000 annual deductible. Keeping the same plan would cost him $1,250 a month because he doesn’t expect to qualify for any assistance. That amount is out of the question, said the self-employed accountant.\n \n\n   \n  One option he’s considering is signing up for a $400-a-month catastrophic plan, which would require him to pay for all his medications, doctor visits and therapy appointments. Another is enrolling in a policy with an $850 monthly premium and a $10,000 deductible that would provide more coverage. But the latter would entail dipping into his retirement fund, pausing his efforts to save for a down payment on a house and raising rates on his clients, which are mostly nonprofit organizations.\n \n\n   \n  A Vermont resident, McKegney said health care is important to him because he is transgender. The battle on Capitol Hill over the enhanced subsidies, also known as advanced premium tax credits, makes him feel “degraded.”\n \n\n   \n  “The tax credits have helped millions of people access health care, and it seems very cruel to then take that away,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The enhanced subsidies’ looming expiration led Nolan LeRoux and Emily Clute to contemplate drastic measures to retain at least some assistance. The couple, both 35, were set to get married on Saturday but have considered not filing their license after the ceremony. That’s because they are more likely to qualify for Obamacare’s original subsidies as individuals than as a married couple — the income threshold for a couple is less than double that of a single person.\n \n\n   \n  Otherwise, the Bethlehem, New York, residents are looking at paying more than $1,360 per month next year for coverage, nearly double the total of what they’d pay as individuals for the same plan with some assistance. If the enhanced subsidies are extended, they would be eligible for more aid, even as a married couple.\n \n\n   \n  Since they aren’t comfortable going without insurance, the couple may end up working more to help cover the cost. He is a barber, and she is a tattoo artist. But they aren’t happy about having to spend more time apart as newlyweds to pay for higher premiums. What’s more, the higher tab would also weigh on their honeymoon plans, dampening any thought of going to California.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, though, the stress of not having health insurance would be greater than the concern of how to pay for it since anything could happen, like being hit by a drunk driver, LeRoux said.\n \n\n   \n  “There are not many things health care-wise that are particularly affordable,” he said. “It’d be a lot of stress because I don’t know exactly how we would pay for a medical bill that was in the five figures.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/economy/stephen-miran-fed-perspective","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00-04:00","title":"The Fed’s newest governor brings a Trump perspective on the economy.

Is anyone buying it? \n       \n  Analysis by Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Federal Reserve’s newest policymaker has an unconventional perspective on the US economy that’s proving tough to sell.\n \n\n   \n  In September, President Donald Trump appointed Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to temporarily fill a vacated seat on the Fed’s powerful Board of Governors. So far, Miran has participated in two Fed meetings — and broken ranks with the vast majority of Fed officials each time.\n \n\n   \n  At the central bank’s October policy meeting, Miran dissented from Fed officials’ decision  to lower interest rates by a quarter point , backing a larger, half-point cut instead, just as he did in September.\n \n\n   \n  He hasn’t wasted any time to leave a first impression in other ways, too.\n \n\n   \n  In his first month as a central banker, Miran spoke publicly about the US economy at more than a dozen events and media interviews. Fed officials typically do only about a handful of public engagements in their first month.\n \n\n   \n  Like Trump, Miran has  repeatedly called for aggressive interest rate cuts . He has argued that borrowing costs are exerting more pressure on the economy than most think and that there’s “substantial disinflation” coming down the pike — views Miran proclaims as “out of consensus.”\n \n\n   \n  He reiterated his stance in a Wednesday interview with Yahoo Finance.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone is sold on Miran’s takes on the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “I certainly wouldn’t characterize anything that he’s saying as ridiculous,” David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura, said in an interview with CNN after he moderated a discussion with Miran in Washington, DC. “It’s more of a debate on the inputs that he’s putting into his economic modeling, which are controversial.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think only time will tell if he ends up being right,” Seif said.\n \n\n   \n    Miran’s takes\n \n\n   \n  Miran’s rationale for significant rate cuts is mostly based on how he views Trump’s sweeping economic policies and  his expectation that Trump’s tariffs won’t stoke inflation. \n \n\n   \n  In his first big speech after being sworn in as a Fed governor, Miran explained how Trump’s policies may be contributing to a lower “neutral rate of interest,” which is a theoretical level of borrowing costs that neither stimulates nor dampens the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  Miran specifically pointed to the administration’s aggressive crackdown on immigration, the president’s signature tax and spending bill passed by Congress earlier this year, and Trump’s widespread tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  In Miran’s view, that means the Fed has a lot of catching up to do to bring rates back to a more neutral level, and he believes time is of the essence.\n \n\n   \n  “If you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,” he told The New York Times in an interview that published on November 1. “I don’t see a reason to run that risk if I’m not concerned about inflation on the upside.”\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, Miran has said the ongoing mass deportations should take some pressure off the housing market, further lowering rates and resulting in “substantial disinflation.” He has also frequently downplayed the potential impacts of tariffs on consumer prices.\n \n\n   \n    Some pushback\n \n\n   \n  Miran, who earned a PhD in economics from Harvard University, is still widely seen as a serious economist, but his ideas have had some pushback.\n \n\n   \n  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was critical last month of Miran’s debut speech as a Fed governor.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot remember an analytically weaker speech given before the New York Economic Club or given by a Fed governor,” Summers told Bloomberg. “If this was the best case for the radical reduction in interest rates that President Trump has been advocating, then that case is even weaker than I had previously supposed.”\n \n\n   \n  Some Wall Street economists also haven’t been impressed by Miran’s takes.\n \n\n   \n  “We find some of his arguments questionable, others incomplete and almost none persuasive,”Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients in late September.\n \n\n   \n  Miran’s distinct economic reasoning also doesn’t seem to have gained traction with his colleagues on the Fed’s rate-setting committee.\n \n\n   \n  Like other Trump appointees, such as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, Miran agrees that a weaker labor market is at risk of falling off a cliff. But neither Waller nor Bowman have voted for a half-point rate cut, nor have they suggested that the neutral rate is lower than widely understood.\n \n\n   \n  Fed Governor Lisa Cook, in  her first speech since Trump said he fired her ,  was asked last week how she views the interaction between lower immigration and housing inflation, which is a cornerstone of Miran’s economic views.\n \n\n   \n  She subtly rejected that premise, stating “when I’m thinking about immigration, I’m typically thinking about the labor market.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think that that’s the major role that I see in immigration policy,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/russian-satellite-spying-explainer-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"04:20:00-05:00","title":"UK and Germany Accuse Russia of Threatening Their Satellites","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Germany and the United Kingdom have issued urgent warnings about the growing threat from Russian and Chinese space satellites, citing repeated instances of Russian reconnaissance, jamming, and interference with Western communication and navigation systems.

of threatening their satellites. Here’s what that means \n       \n  By Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Germany and the United Kingdom have warned of the growing threat posed by Russian and Chinese  space satellites , which have been regularly spotted spying on satellites used by Western powers.\n \n\n   \n  The countries have in recent weeks highlighted frequent instances of  Russia  stalking, jamming and interfering with their satellites in space.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s actions, especially in space, pose a fundamental threat to us all. A threat we can no longer ignore,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius  told a Berlin conference  of space industry leaders in September.\n \n\n   \n  Targeting communications satellites can impact things like satellite imagery, telecoms and broadband satellite internet access. Disrupting navigation and positioning systems can impact military operations as well as civil aviation, according to the global think tank RAND.\n \n\n   \n  The warnings come in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now well into its third year. Ukrainian officials say Moscow has increased its level of cooperation with China, with Beijing conducting satellite reconnaissance of Ukrainian territory on its behalf.\n \n\n   \n  Here is what officials and experts say about the satellite threats in space.\n \n\n   \n    What has Russia been doing?\n \n\n   \n  Pistorius noted that two Russian reconnaissance satellites were recently spotted tracking two IntelSat satellites, which are used by the German Armed Forces and its allies. IntelSat is a commercial satellite services provider whose fleet is used by governments and companies in the US and Europe.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia and China have rapidly expanded their space warfare capabilities in recent years: They can jam, blind, manipulate, or kinetically destroy satellites,” Pistorius added, announcing a multi-billion-dollar boost in funding for German space programs.\n \n\n   \n  The head of the UK Space Command also sounded the alarm, saying that Russian satellites are stalking British assets in space, as well as jamming them on a “weekly” basis.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve got payloads on board that can see our satellites and are trying to collect information from them,” Major General Paul Tedman told the BBC last month. Jamming is conducted using ground-based infrastructure. Russia has spent years developing electronic warfare capabilities amid the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte once again warned this year of Russia’s plans to develop  nuclear weapons in space  to disable and destroy satellites.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space. But Russia also vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called for member states to not develop space-based nuclear weapons in 2024. China abstained from voting.\n \n\n   \n    How does satellite ‘spying’ work and how is it detected?\n \n\n   \n  In general, it’s relatively simple for space forces to detect and locate foreign satellites, but it’s difficult to determine their exact capabilities and intentions.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities make assumptions about the intent of Russian satellites based on where the satellite is in space, what else it’s near and historical patterns of what similar satellites have done, according to expert Clayton Swope, the deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  For example, if a Russian satellite lingers for a long period of time near a European communications satellite, authorities can infer that it’s there to spy.\n \n\n   \n  Experts believe the Russian satellites that got close to the two IntelSat satellites used in part by Germany were there to intercept signals.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in lower orbits, Russian satellites have previously tested “things that look like weapons and fired projectiles,” Swope told CNN. Authorities can identify satellites that look similar to those equipped with projectiles to determine that they are a physical threat to other countries’ assets.\n \n\n   \n  “The Russians have a history of having those types of satellites shadowing other satellites in a way that people might think it’s a sleeper cell, waiting to strike at a moment’s notice,” Swope said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard to distinguish between a threat in the sense of a weapon and the threat in the sense of intelligence collection,” he added. “Sometimes you really are guessing a lot about what the capabilities of a satellite are as well as the intentions of the operator.”\n \n\n   \n  The Russian space agency has previously downplayed the danger of its weapons tests in space.\n \n\n   \n    How long has the threat from Russia existed?\n \n\n   \n  Germany and the UK are just the latest countries to sound the alarm. The United States and France first warned more than a decade ago that Russian satellites appeared to be spying and collecting information on their assets, including on commercially run satellites.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Defense said in 2015 that a Russian military satellite had parked itself near two Intelsat satellites, prompting the US to contact Moscow about its movements, which many at the time described as  “mysterious.” \n \n\n   \n  Then in 2017, after France and Italy jointly launched an intelligence satellite, Russian satellites were soon getting close to it to take a look, according to Juliana Suess, a security policy researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).\n \n\n   \n  “So, these kinds of behaviors are not entirely new, but I think also need to be seen in the context of Ukraine, and to be seen in the context of the  airspace violations  that we see Russia conducting with regard to NATO airspace,” Suess told CNN of the recent reports of satellite spying and interference. “All of these things ought to be seen in the broader context.”\n \n\n   \n    Is China also posing a threat?\n \n\n   \n  China is just as much of a threat as Russia, if not more so, experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Although the threats from Russia are more pressing for Europe due to their proximity, “the much bigger space power is obviously China,” Suess said. Analysts have noted some sophisticated Chinese maneuvers in space aimed at getting close to other satellites, “at just incredibly high speeds and with precision that I think has really raised some eyebrows in the West.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of China’s capabilities have raised international concerns, according to the SWP analyst. For example, China has tested a satellite with a robotic arm that can shift other satellites into a different orbit.\n \n\n   \n  China also has “a lot more money to conduct themselves in space,” Suess said. “We’re not going to see much more space growth out of Russia at the moment. Their resources are far too stretched for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s activities in space are very active and their objectives are more opaque, according to Swope, the CSIS analyst.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t always know what they’re doing, and they’re doing a lot of different things that leave a lot of people scratching their heads,” Swope added.\n \n\n   \n    Is the European response adequate?\n \n\n   \n  Germany said it will budget up to €35 billion ($40.2 billion) over the next five years for space projects.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a big number, for sure. I think it also reflects that there’s a sort of political will to now catch up and, you know, really get things going,” Suess said. But she also stressed that the space race is an ongoing process, with no finish line in sight. “Europe as a whole has a lot to catch up on. Germany certainly has a lot to catch up on.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the German Ministry of Defense told CNN that its procurement measures relating to space will amount to around €1.9 billion ($2.2 billion) in 2025, “but will grow significantly in the coming years.”\n \n\n   \n  The UK government also announced a commitment to increase defense spending this year and a  strategic review  of British capabilities outlined that “greater attention must be given to the space and cyber and electromagnetic domains.” The UK announced in October that it is testing sensors to detect laser threats in space as part of measures to protect British satellites.\n \n\n   \n  But an analysis from the London-based think tank  Chatham House argued  that even greater near-term investment is needed, and that the strategic review failed to recognize how urgent the threats in space truly are, putting the country at risk of falling behind.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, France has “been very vocal about the need to have what they refer to as ‘bodyguard satellites,’ so, satellites whose job it is to protect other satellites,” Swope said. What those satellites will look like is an open question, he added, with development ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  The US still has a historic advantage in space after investing much more in recent years, analysts said. But European allies may benefit from that through cooperation under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other alliances.\n \n\n   \n  NATO declared in 2019 that space is an “operational domain” for the transatlantic alliance and years later announced that Article 5 would apply in space.  Article 5  is the principle that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all members. Analysts at RAND have argued, though, that  NATO needs to “throttle up”  on its space enterprise or risk falling short at a critical time.\n \n\n   \n  While falling behind is a real concern, particularly compared to China’s advances, there is also evidence that the Russia has not integrated its satellite systems into its military infrastructure as well as many other space powers.\n \n\n   \n  Suess cited an example of a Russian fighter jet downed in Ukraine that was found with a built-in Russian navigation system but also a commercial GPS taped to the dashboard. Analysts have also seen evidence that Russia is procuring commercial satellite imagery from the private market – an indication that its own capabilities are not up to scratch.\n \n\n   \n  “We have seen from anecdotal evidence in Ukraine that Russia does not have some sort of level of confidence that one would typically expect in their own systems,” Suess added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/trump-oval-office-event","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"20:24:00-05:00","title":"Images of Trump appearing to close his eyes during Oval Office event spread across social media","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Images of Donald Trump appearing to close his eyes during a public Oval Office announcement about cutting prices for weight-loss drugs went viral on social media, prompting criticism from political opponents such as California Governor Gavin Newsom, who labeled Trump 'Dozy Don.'

across social media \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Samantha Waldenberg, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:24 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Images of Donald Trump appearing to close his eyes at an Oval Office announcement this week rocketed around social media this weekend, with the president’s opponents seizing on the footage to raise questions about Trump’s on-the-job performance.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was participating in an announcement Thursday  about cutting prices  for popular weight-loss drugs, speaking from behind the Resolute Desk alongside other officials.\n \n\n   \n  At moments, Trump’s eyes appeared closed, and at others he seemed to struggle to keep them open. He rubbed his eyes at points.\n \n\n   \n  The images drew swift criticism from Trump’s critics. The press office for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the president’s top foils, posted images from the event and wrote: “DOZY DON IS BACK.”\n \n\n   \n  White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CNN that “the President was not sleeping; in fact, he spoke throughout and took many questions from the press during this announcement which represents a historic reduction in prices for Americans on two drugs that help Americans struggling with diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other conditions. This announcement by President Trump will save a significant amount of money and countless American lives, and yet the failing, liberal media want to push a garbage narrative instead of covering it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump appears in public regularly and participates in lengthy question-and-answer sessions with reporters. Aides and Cabinet members routinely praise his stamina and describe receiving phone calls or messages from him at all hours.\n \n\n   \n  A day before Thursday’s event, Trump traveled to Miami for an economic speech that lasted more than an hour. He also completed a three-nation swing through Asia at the end of last month.\n \n\n   \n  Still, questions about Trump’s health have persisted since he took office as the oldest man ever inaugurated to the job. The 79-year-old president said last month that  he received an MRI  during a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center without saying why.\n \n\n   \n  Over the summer, the White House announced that doctors examined Trump for swelling in his legs and  diagnosed him  with chronic venous insufficiency. It’s a condition in which valves inside certain veins don’t work the way they should, which can allow blood to pool or collect in the veins.\n \n\n   \n  All presidents, at moments, have appeared tired in public. Even a much younger president like Barack Obama would occasionally rub fatigued eyes during long summits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has harshly criticized former President Joe Biden for a lack of vigor, labeling him “Sleepy Joe” in last year’s election and continuing to use the moniker. Biden, the oldest president in history, was also seen at moments closing his eyes during public events.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/trump-administration-supreme-court-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court lets Trump pause full SNAP payments for now","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court, led by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for November.

The decision, while temporary, could put at risk the full benefits for millions of Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to feed themselves and their families.\n \n\n   \n  The order does not resolve the underlying legal questions raised by the case – and the Trump administration has already committed to using the program’s contingency fund to partially pay benefits. Rather, Jackson’s “administrative stay” freezes any additional action by the administration to give an appeals court additional time to review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson is the justice assigned to handle emergency appeals from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n \n\n   \n  The legal fight over food stamps has emerged as a central pressure point between all three branches during the historically long government shutdown because it is one of the easiest to understand and most tangible impacts of that impasse so far. At stake is food assistance that nearly 42 million Americans rely on.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how the case will ultimately impact the billions of dollars spent in federal SNAP funding.\n \n\n   \n    Complying with the lower court\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s emergency request to the justices came hours after the USDA told states that it was  working to comply with the ruling to fully fund the program  that was issued a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island.\n \n\n   \n  This latest legal move has injected more uncertainty into whether food stamp recipients would see their full allotments anytime soon.\n \n\n   \n  The administration had made a similar emergency appeal to a Boston-based federal appeals court Friday morning, but the court had not yet weighed in by the time the USDA sent the guidance, which also said the process to make full funding for November available should be completed later on Friday. The appeals court, in a brief order Friday night, declined to put the payments on hold temporarily while it reviewed the case “as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the administration said, “Such a funding lapse is a crisis. But it is a crisis occasioned by congressional failure and one that can only be solved through congressional action.”\n \n\n   \n  “The district court’s ruling,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court, “is untenable at every turn.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration moved to appeal McConnell’s order after he ruled on Thursday that the government had to provide full SNAP benefits for November, instead of issuing only partial benefits as he had mandated days earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Rushing to fund full benefits\n \n\n   \n  Before the latest legal twist, several states had rushed to start issuing full SNAP payments to their residents. But that has caused problems, according to the administration’s filing to the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Sauer told the court that Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards. But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, Sauer said.\n \n\n   \n  These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, he continued. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “Today, in accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.”\n \n\n   \n  Other states have also promised beneficiaries would start receiving their full allotments as soon as Friday or over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania residents who should have already received their SNAP benefits this month will start seeing their full payments hit their electronic benefit transfer cards on Friday, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced at a press conference earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  “We are hoping that by this evening, by midnight or so, that all of those individuals who were owed money over the first week or so of this month, who hadn’t gotten it from the federal administration, are going to get their money,” Shapiro said.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that state officials continue to prepare for the Supreme Court’s ultimate decision. Meanwhile, residents who received their benefits are able to spend them.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the governors of Maryland and New York said beneficiaries could expect to start seeing their benefits over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in appropriations for the government.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling last week that the agency must at least tap into contingency funds to provide partial benefits for this month or, at its discretion, use other revenue to fully fund November’s allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The agency opted to  fund partial benefits , but warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell earlier this week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\n \n\n   \n  “People have gone without for too long,” McConnell said during a hearing Thursday. “Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  Under McConnell’s ruling, the government was required to transfer additional unused tariff revenue used to support child nutrition programs in order to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with more details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/sport/college-football-indiana-penn-state-miracle-catch","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"17:35:00-05:00","title":"Miraculous late toe-tap touchdown keeps No. 2 Indiana’s perfect season alive","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a dramatic finish, No. 2 Indiana University secured a 27-24 victory over Penn State in State College, Pennsylvania, preserving their perfect 10-0 season with a miraculous seven-yard touchdown by wide receiver Omar Cooper Jr. After a strong third-quarter lead, Penn State rallied with a 19-yard touchdown, but Indiana’s quarterback Fernando Mendoza led a crucial 10-play, 80-yard drive to set up the winning score.

the season.\n \n\n   \n  The late dramatics came after it seemed like Indiana would have no issues getting the program’s first-ever win in Happy Valley, up 13 points in the third quarter.\n \n\n   \n  But with the intense Beaver Stadium crowd behind the home team despite its struggles all season, the Hoosiers found themselves in unfamiliar territory after Penn State rallied to make it a close game

These are some of the biggest password blunders \n       \n  By Charlotte Reck, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A 2014 security report resurfaced this week showing that the password for the server managing the CCTV network at the Louvre – Paris’ art museum which suffered immense financial loss after a  heist team  successfully  targeted historical jewels  last month – was, in fact, just  “LOUVRE.” \n \n\n   \n  But predictable passwords like these are concerningly common.\n \n\n   \n  Logging into social media accounts, shopping apps and subscriber platforms can be a laborious task that leaves many launching devices across the room in frustration and asking why it’s necessary to hire a crack team just to access a personal account.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps it’s time to consider the demand for 16-character combinations of letters, numbers and symbols to be more method than madness, and learn from the mistakes of the weak-password-makers who’ve gone before.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some examples of technological mishaps and infamous faux pas(swords):\n \n\n   \n    Colonial Pipeline blunder:\n \n\n   \n  In May 2021, one of the largest fuel pipeline systems in the United States was  paralyzed  when a cyberattack brought operations to an abrupt halt. At the time, the FBI said the hackers responsible belonged to criminal group Darkside, believed to be based in Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Colonial Pipeline said its network had been accessed via a compromised password that was linked to a disused virtual private networking account used for remote access. The account was not guarded by an extra layer of security known as multi-factor authentication.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how the attackers obtained the compromised credential. But the company claimed the password in question was not easily guessable, with CEO Joseph Blount telling a US Senate committee in June 2021:”It was a complicated password, I want to be clear on that. It was not a Colonial123-type password.” The shutdown remained in place until the company complied with a ransom demand, paying $4.4 million to end the attack.\n \n\n   \n  By the following year, the FBI had  recovered millions  of dollars extorted from Colonial Pipeline by Darkside.\n \n\n   \n    Zero chance forgetting the nuclear launch code:\n \n\n   \n  According to Bruce Blair, a former Air Force launch officer and nuclear policy expert, between 1962 and the mid-1970s the most powerful digits on the globe were simple – eight zeros.\n \n\n   \n  In a twist as absurd as Peter Sellers’ president declaring the War Room a place where gentlemen must not fight in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 dark comedy “Dr. Strangelove,” Blair claimed just eight zeros separated the US from launching a nuclear attack.\n \n\n   \n  Blair said a “two-man-rule,” which required two qualified crew members to be present at the location of the launch code, was considered the primary human safeguard, but the measure wasn’t always reliable. According to Blair, the two members on shift would often organize alternative sleeping rotas that left just one individual with a straightforward password and all the power.\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, the Strategic Air Command amended the system to include a unique enable code that transmitted to the launch crew from a higher authority. The change added further security steps to the process and, as Blair  said , “It no longer sufficed just to flip one switch.”\n \n\n   \n  The nuclear expert’s shocking revelation came decades after it was decided that solely punching in eight zeros might be a little lax when it comes to initiating nuclear war.\n \n\n   \n    A 158-year-old business tanked by hackers:\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of jobs were lost when an unsuspecting transport company in eastern England was toppled by a hacking gang, British media reported.\n \n\n   \n  Northamptonshire business KNP was targeted in June 2023 by Akira, a group of hackers who gained access to the company’s system by guessing the password of an employee. Once inside, the hackers encrypted KNP’s data and locked its internal systems before demanding a ransom.\n \n\n   \n  Being unable to make the payment, the company’s data was lost, and the 158-year-old business went under.\n \n\n   \n  KNP’s director Paul Abbott admitted he never told the employee with the weak password that it was their information that was compromised and likely led to the company’s demise. “Would you want to know if it was you?” Abbott  told the BBC .\n \n\n   \n    Phone hacking scandal:\n \n\n   \n  Hugh Grant, Prince Harry and Sienna Miller were among the stars who fell victim to  phone hacking  during a scandal perpetrated by British tabloids that spanned several years.\n \n\n   \n  Formal inquiries began after complaints that personal information shared only in private realms was routinely exposed on the front pages of national newspapers, causing distress and compromising the safety of those targeted.\n \n\n   \n  Investigations found the voicemails of public figures were hacked by journalists and private investigators hired by publications who worked on the assumption that few people changed the default voicemail access code their handset came with. Simple combinations like 1111, 4444 and 1234 were used to gain access to the messages waiting in the inbox.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom’s phone-hacking scandal led to the closure of the News Of The World’s in 2011, followed by an inquiry into the practises and ethics of the British press.\n \n\n   \n    A one-time hacker now an opposition party leader:\n \n\n   \n  As head of the opposition, the UK’s Conservative Party leader  Kemi Badenoch  spends a lot of time critiquing the current British government. But her record isn’t squeaky clean.\n \n\n   \n  Back in 2018, the politician confessed to hacking the official website of Labour peer Harriet Harman a decade earlier and changing the content to be pro-Conservative.\n \n\n   \n  But this was no mastermind crime – the password required to edit Harman’s website was, indeed, “Harriet Harman.”\n \n\n   \n  Badenoch, who was not a lawmaker at the time of the hack, has since apologized for what she called a “foolish prank.”\n \n\n   \n    Personal data of millions of UK voters vulnerable:\n \n\n   \n  From August 2021 through to 2022, cyber attackers gained access to computers containing Electoral Registers – lists of names and addresses of millions of voters across the UK, the country’s data privacy watchdog discovered.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said hackers accessed the system by imitating a legitimate user account. The ICO determined this possible because appropriate security measures were consistently missed.\n \n\n   \n  Software designed to fix security holes was not installed, and the company failed to enforce a policy that ensured employees used secure passwords. During inquiries, the ICO found 178 active email accounts using passwords identical or similar to those set by the organization’s IT desk when the account was activated.\n \n\n   \n  The Electoral Commission was formally reprimanded for their negligence. No evidence of data misuse was reported.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/americas/brazil-tornado-weather-parana-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"20:35:00-05:00","title":"Unprecedented tornado tears through southern Brazil, killing at least six","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An unprecedented tornado struck the town of Rio Bonito do Iguaçu in Paraná state, southern Brazil, killing at least six people and injuring over 750.

Only the University of Louisville Cardinals draw a larger pregame crowd.\n \n\n   \n  Surrounded by big-screen TVs and signs for the domestic beer buckets and other specials, the no-frills, family-owned watering hole near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport is popular among workers from the nearby United Parcel Service package handling facility and the Ford SUV assembly plant.\n \n\n   \n  For the Kentucky opener, Stooges was offering 59-cent shrimp all day.\n \n\n   \n  “I had just ordered my first beer and the lights went out,” Stooges regular Bryson Beck recalled.\n \n\n   \n  Kyla Kenady, working that afternoon, handed him a beer, turned around and looked outside to see “a plane in flames going down.”\n \n\n   \n  The  first report  of the “catastrophic” crash of a UPS MD-11 plane was at about 5:15 p.m. ET on Tuesday, according to state officials. The disaster killed  at least 14 people  and  destroyed nearby businesses  and buildings.\n \n\n   \n  “This plane barely missed a restaurant/bar,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear told CNN. “It was very close to a very large Ford plant with hundreds, if not a thousand-plus workers.”\n \n\n   \n  The randomness of the disaster has left locals in a state of shock.\n \n\n   \n  Debbie Self, who, along with her late husband Rodger, opened Stooges more than 40 years ago, said firefighters told her the plane came down roughly 100 yards from her business.\n \n\n   \n  “It was close. They said, ‘We don’t know how you made it,’” said Self, who was having dinner elsewhere at the time of the crash.\n \n\n   \n  The UPS cargo plane came down after an engine detached during takeoff, officials said. Investigators clarified Friday that their earlier report the plane had reached 475 feet was inaccurate, noting data now shows the jet only climbed about 100 feet above ground level before crashing.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to three UPS crew members identified from the plane, nine members of the community have been reported missing, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. They were believed to be in the area at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The crash left a fiery trail of destruction and a half-mile-long debris field, devastating multiple small businesses, such as Grade A Auto Parts, where mangled, blackened remnants of buildings were set in the background of what a Kentucky official described as an “apocalyptic” ashy sky with an acrid smell in the air.\n \n\n   \n  As flames raged and doors melted shut,  people jumped from windows and ran,  some employees helping shield others from the growing inferno at the recycling plant, according to its owner.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene showed a mountainous plume of charcoal-colored smoke emanating from buildings that were set ablaze. In another video at the facility, a man yelled, “Did everybody make it out?” When another person responded, “No,” he screamed, “What do you mean no?”\n \n\n   \n  “I thought it was the end of the world,” Robert Sanders, a 50-year-old employee at the plant told CNN. He lived in a RV trailer on the site of the facility and believes it was destroyed along with all his personal belongings.\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the crash showed a towering wave of smoke and flames billowing skyward near the airport after the low-flying plane struggled to climb and then erupted into an enormous fireball on impact.\n \n\n   \n    Stooges’ parking lot is now a temporary morgue, owner says\n \n\n   \n  At Stooges, Kenady went into “fight or flight” response. The burning plane appeared to fly right over the volleyball courts in the parking lot.\n \n\n   \n  “I turned around, ran down the bar and screamed to everyone that a plane was crashing, grabbed my things, grabbed my phone, my purse, ran out the door as everyone, in panic, ran out at the same time,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  She got into her car and, across the street, felt the ground shaking and what she said was a terrifying rush of heated air.\n \n\n   \n  It was a horrific scenario Kenady said had crossed her mind before. The roar of the planes on takeoff is so loud that people normally have to pause their conversations in the bar.\n \n\n   \n  “We think that something like that would happen but you don’t ever think it would happen to you,” she said of the disaster.\n \n\n   \n  Beck, the bar customer, did not get past his first beer. The lights went out, then he heard “the biggest boom.” The building shook.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been in earthquakes in California before and it didn’t hold a candle to how this place shook,” he said. “Everybody started freaking out and then there’s more booms.”\n \n\n   \n  Beck ran outside. A thick cloud of black smoke enveloped the afternoon sky. “I thought that maybe a country was bombing us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He ran into a friend, who wanted to rush to the crash scene to help.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not firefighters. We’re not first responders. We don’t have gear,” Beck told his friend. “We have to leave.”\n \n\n   \n  If the plane had gone down a few hundred feet from where it crashed, Beck said, “I would not be talking to you right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Stooges has been in operation since 1984, according to an  obituary  for Self’s husband, who co-founded the business with her.\n \n\n   \n  “Please join us in praying for the victims, their families, and all of the brave first responders,” Self wrote on the  bar’s Facebook page. \n \n\n   \n  “I do believe Rodger shielded that place and all inside, wrapping his angel wings around it,” a local commented on Facebook, referring to Stooges and Self’s late husband.\n \n\n   \n  Another Louisville bar has offered temporary jobs to Stooges employees who are now out of work, according to Self, who has also started a fundraising campaign for her more than 40 employees.\n \n\n   \n  “We were very fortunate. Others were not so fortunate,” Self said.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of the crash, Self said she was having dinner about three miles away from Stooges. She got a call from a worker and rushed to the bar but could not get close.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought it would be gone,” she said of Stooges. “I can’t believe it survived. From now on it will always be known as a place that was left intact in the middle of a war zone.”\n \n\n   \n  Stooges appears to be undamaged but Self said she is unsure when it will reopen. Its parking lot, usually a venue for wrestling matches and volleyball games, is now a temporary morgue.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/weekend-travel-flight-cuts-government-shutdown-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"10:52:00.000-05:00","title":"Travelers Face Mounting Delays This Weekend as Airlines Cut Hundreds of Flights Due to Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to an ongoing government shutdown, U.S. airlines are canceling hundreds of flights and facing widespread delays across major domestic and international airports.

Here’s what to know \n       \n  By Emma Tucker, Pete Muntean, Hanna Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:52 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Disgruntled travelers across the US will face more disruptions to their plans this weekend, as airlines cancel hundreds of additional flights and delays continue to mount due to air traffic controller staffing shortages amid a government shutdown with no end in sight.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,700 flights have been canceled from Friday through Sunday, data from Cirium shows, as airlines start to implement a 4% reduction in domestic flights at 40 of the busiest airports mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n \n\n   \n  But the cuts – which officials say are aimed at keeping air travel safe while some of the air traffic controllers and federal security screeners missing paychecks are not showing up to work – haven’t prevented thousands of hourslong delays that have left flyers scrambling to figure out how to get to their destinations.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t want to be stranded at the airport sleeping on a bench,” Michele Cuthbert of Columbus, Ohio, told   The Associated Press , expressing concern about possible flight cancellations ahead of her trip to Dallas.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next week, airlines will ramp up flight cancellations to 10% by next Friday if the government shutdown remains unsolved. And the shutdown will likely disrupt holiday travel plans if no deal is reached after next week, plunging flyers into “uncharted territory,” said former FAA deputy administrator Dan Elwell.\n \n\n   \n  But travelers can still see flight cuts even if the government were to reopen next week, as the FAA’s order requires airlines to cancel flights days in advance.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know if you plan to travel by air in the coming days:\n \n\n   \n    Why is the FAA ordering flight cuts?\n \n\n   \n  An emergency order by the FAA on Thursday said airlines have to cut traffic by 4%, resulting in about 800 flight cancellations for Friday that increased to over 1,000 throughout the day, according to FlightAware.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, there were more than 1,500 flight cancellations and over 6,600 delays, according to the flight tracking website. More than 1,000 flights have already been canceled for Sunday and over 240 delayed, the data show.\n \n\n   \n  The disruptions are primarily caused by air traffic controller staffing and the FAA order, but also include unrelated flight cuts.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines will be required to cut 6% of their flights to those 40 airports on Tuesday, 8% Thursday and 10% next Friday if the shutdown drags on, the FAA says.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage could rise to 15-20% if the gridlock in Congress doesn’t end “relatively soon,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned in an interview with Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to very much disrupt their Thanksgiving travel plans, I’m sure,” Elwell said about the flight cuts. “And let’s just hope we don’t get there.”\n \n\n   \n  Elwell, who served in the first Trump administration, said flight delays caused by the second-longest government shutdown starting in 2018 “actually brought people back to the table and ended the shutdown back in 2019.”\n \n\n   \n    Why are some air traffic controllers not showing up to work?\n \n\n   \n  The effects of air travel disruptions resulting from the shutdown will likely linger even if Congress makes a deal to reopen the government, as the  transportation secretary says  air traffic controllers may not return to work right away.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA said air control facilities nationwide were short-staffed 42 times on Saturday, according to an operations plan. And problems continue despite the flight cancellations designed to relieve stress on controllers struggling to deal with the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Aaron Barker, an employee of the Transportation Security Administration and leader of the American Federation of Government Employees Union, said neither he nor his colleagues are able to make ends meet during the shutdown as controllers miss a second full paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now at the point where today would have been a payday for officers,” he told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on Saturday. “So now I have members who are coming — they’re being evicted. Some of them are already evicted. I have one family who I just learned was sleeping in their car with children.”\n \n\n   \n  More flight reductions – intended to reduce flow and maintain safety – mean the number of air traffic controllers not showing up for work will continue to rise, Elwell said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re going to have to make hard financial decisions,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    What airlines have canceled flights this weekend?\n \n\n   \n  Major airlines have announced further cancellations to hundreds of flights scheduled through the weekend after more than 1,000 were slashed on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines will cut 220 flights from its schedule through Monday, a spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, United Airlines announced hundreds of cuts through early next week, including 168 on Saturday; 158 on Sunday; 190 on Monday and 269 on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Southwest Airlines will cancel about 100 flights Saturday and 150 Sunday to comply with the FAA order, saying in a statement the carrier has already reduced its schedule by 4% through Monday at 34 of the 117 airports it serves.\n \n\n   \n  The vast majority of Southwest flights, however, will not be disrupted, said the airline, which is contacting affected customers directly.\n \n\n   \n  More than 140 Delta and 140 Delta Connection flights have also been canceled. “Additional cancels for Sunday can be expected,” the airline said in a  news release .\n \n\n   \n    How can I get around flight disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  Major airlines like American, Delta, Southwest, United and Frontier are all waiving fees for passengers who want to change their tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Airline officials like Frontier’s CEO Barry Biffle are urging people to book a separate, backup ticket on another carrier if they don’t want to risk being stranded when their flight is canceled.\n \n\n   \n  Try to mitigate any headaches from delays and cancellations by avoiding booking flights with layovers, nonprofit  US Public Interest Research Group  says, and opt to make reservations directly with the airline rather than a third-party website.\n \n\n   \n  Other useful tips for travelers include proactively checking your flight status in case airlines don’t send out alerts; paying for flight disruption coverage or travel insurance with a credit card; and knowing you’re entitled to a full cash refund if your domestic flight is canceled or delayed over three hours, according to guidance from Brian Kelly, founder of travel website The Points Guy.\n \n\n   \n    What airports are seeing flight delays and cancellations?\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s busiest airports were hit hardest as the shutdown’s ripple effects spread across nearly every part of the air travel network on Friday – the first day of the Trump administration’s mandatory cuts to reduce US air traffic – and continue into the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  The three major airports servicing the New York City area are experiencing hourslong delays on Saturday due to staffing shortages, according to the FAA.\n \n\n   \n  A ground stop was temporarily issued for flights traveling to Newark Liberty International Airport Saturday after the FAA noted flights into the airport were delayed an average of over four hours earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  Flights coming into LaGuardia Airport were delayed nearly an hour, while departures were also delayed an average of 75 minutes and increasing. And those headed to John F. Kennedy International Airport are delayed an average of over 2.5 hours, while departures from the airport are currently delayed an average of 105 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, flights arriving at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport are delayed an average of five and a half hours, the FAA said.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Washington, DC’s Reagan National Airport faced the most severe disruption, with nearly 80 flights canceled and almost half of all arrivals delayed, according to tracking site  FlightAware .\n \n\n   \n  Chicago O’Hare, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International, Denver International and Dallas-Fort Worth also experienced dozens of cancellations and hundreds of delays, FlightAware data show. On the West Coast, Los Angeles International and San Francisco International reported similar issues.\n \n\n   \n  Other affected airports include Boston Logan, Phoenix Sky Harbor, Seattle-Tacoma and Orlando International, all reporting slowdowns heading into the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Internationally, major hubs like Amsterdam Schiphol, Toronto Pearson and Tokyo Haneda, saw cancellations climbing into the double digits.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/tampa-florida-police-chase-crash","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"12:19:00-05:00","title":"At least 4 killed after driver slams into Tampa bar, 11 others injured","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A speeding driver, 22-year-old Silas Sampson, fled police on a freeway in Tampa, Florida, after being seen street racing.

By Arit John, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:50 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision not to seek reelection next year could open the floodgates on the race to replace her.\n \n\n   \n  Pelosi, who has served in Congress since 1987, already had two primary challengers ahead of her Thursday announcement: Saikat Chakrabarti, a former chief of staff to US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic California state Sen. Scott Wiener.\n \n\n   \n  Chakrabarti launched his bid to unseat Pelosi earlier this year as part of a wave of younger Democratic challengers who argued the party needed candidates with new ideas to reshape it in the wake of Republicans’ 2024 electoral wins.\n \n\n   \n  Wiener, who has represented much of the city in the state Senate since 2016, previously said he wouldn’t challenge the former House Speaker. But he argued that it was necessary to get in against Chakrabarti, a self-funder who made his millions in the tech industry.\n \n\n   \n  “I never wanted to run against Nancy Pelosi. I have enormous respect for her – I think she walks on water,” Wiener said in an interview. “But there are limits to how long you can wait. At some point, you need to get into the race and start making the case to the voters.”\n \n\n   \n  Other candidates are expected to announce their own bids. San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan has been floated as a potential candidate and former San Francisco Mayor London Breed told Politico Friday she is considering running.\n \n\n   \n  Already, the field of prospective and declared candidates has sparked discussions about what kind of leader the district should elect to represent a rare, solidly blue open seat. Pelosi won re-election to the San Francisco seat in 2024 with 81% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re really seeking authentic and courageous leadership for working families across the country, and San Francisco deserves no less,” Jane Kim, the California director for the Working Families Party, told CNN. “It is a generational chance for a bold new voice in Congress for the city by the bay, and we look forward to a robust endorsement process.”\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how the field is shaping up so far:\n \n\n   \n    A tech millionaire and progressive activist\n \n\n   \n  Chakrabarti launched his campaign to unseat Pelosi in February, arguing that while he respected what she had accomplished during her career, the Democratic Party needed new leaders who could meet the current moment. He helped kick off a wave of young challengers who argued the party needs to be completely overhauled.\n \n\n   \n  He praised Pelosi for deciding not to seek reelection.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s a continuation of her leadership, to actually step down from power,” he said in an interview. “It’s a very rare act of leadership in Washington, DC.”\n \n\n   \n  A software engineer by trade, Chakrabarti made his fortune as a founding engineer at the payment platform Stripe. He went on to work on independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, helped found Justice Democrats, a progressive group that backs primary challenges against centrist Democratic incumbents, and managed Ocasio-Cortez’s 2018 congressional campaign. As her chief of staff, he helped author the Green New Deal, the left’s sweeping climate policy legislation.\n \n\n   \n  Chakrabarti has pointed to that resume as proof of his progressive bona fides after  facing criticism from some San Francisco progressives , particularly over his endorsement of a more centrist Board of Supervisors candidate who ousted a Democratic Socialists of America-backed incumbent last year. He said he’s been attacked from both the left and the right over the course of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “In San Francisco, I guess I’m in the center somewhere, and I hope that means the majority of the city is with me,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    A longtime state senator\n \n\n   \n  Wiener has focused on housing policy and LGBTQ rights during his nearly 10 years in the state Senate. He’s also set up a robust fundraising operation – his campaign announced that it had raised more than $730,000 on the day he launched his bid last month, before Pelosi announced her plans to retire.\n \n\n   \n  Wiener said the presence of a self-funder like Chakrabarti in the race, and a looming filing deadline, spurred him to jump in.\n \n\n   \n  Dan Newman, a San Francisco-based Democratic strategist, said that his decision to jump in early was “risky” but proved to be smart.\n \n\n   \n  “People understood that he couldn’t wait forever,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    A wide open field\n \n\n   \n  California’s congressional filing period doesn’t begin until early next year, at which point several Democrats and few Republicans could enter the race.\n \n\n   \n  Chan, who was first elected as a supervisor in 2020 and views Pelosi as a mentor, could garner support from progressives and labor leaders. Pelosi has not endorsed in the race, but political observers have noted the former Speaker and Chan worked together to pass Democrats’ redistricting push, Proposition 50.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is about thanking Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi for her legendary public service, and honoring her and her family for their extraordinary commitment to San Francisco and to bettering our entire country,” Chan said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The latest congressional hopeful to signal interest was Breed. The former mayor led the city from 2018 until 2025, after losing her re-election bid to incumbent Mayor Daniel Lurie.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important that San Franciscans have options,”  Breed told Politico . “I want to explore whether I could potentially be one of those options.”\n \n\n   \n  Another open question is whether Pelosi’s daughter, lawyer Christine Pelosi, will enter the race. Newman said that, for years, conventional wisdom held that the younger Pelosi would pursue the seat when her mother retired. That certainty has faded, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Whoever Pelosi eventually backs would become a frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  “If Nancy picked somebody off the street, then that gives them a little bit of instant credibility,” Newman said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/india/india-shah-rukh-khan-last-superstar-feature-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"19:53:00-05:00","title":"The last of India’s mythic superstars","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article chronicles the cultural phenomenon of Shah Rukh Khan’s enduring fame in India, framed as the twilight of a mythic era in Indian cinema.

7:53 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The ritual begins, as it always does, with a pilgrimage.\n \n\n   \n  People pour in from the dense warrens of India’s financial capital and from dusty villages thousands of kilometers away, all flowing towards the fortified, sea-facing Mumbai home of actor Shah Rukh Khan.\n \n\n   \n  The crowd is a mix of teenagers angling for a glimpse of the icon inside; middle-aged women for whom he was a first love; grown men who see their own aspirations mirrored in his trajectory.\n \n\n   \n  Known as “SRK” by millions, and “King Khan” to his fans, he turned 60 last week, and the chaotic display of devotion outside his home is a testament to a level of stardom rarely seen elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  The air is thick with chants celebrating his milestone. Some have waited overnight. They don masks or T-shirts with his face on, or clutch posters of his movies. All are here for the same sacrament: to get a glimpse of the superstar and be included in the sweep of his signature open-armed embrace.\n \n\n   \n  “I have loved him for a long time so I have come here to wish him happy birthday,” one fan told a local news agency. “Happy, happy birthday Shah Rukh brother. Happy birthday to you.”\n \n\n   \n  Another said he comes here every year. “I’ve been a fan of him since I was born… I have watched all his films,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  This bond was forged in a bygone era. As India opened its economy to the world in the 1990s, Khan opened its heart. He was an outsider who stormed the dynastic gates of Bollywood with little more than wit, ambition, and dimples that could disarm a subcontinent.\n \n\n   \n  And while the adoring thousands gather outside his home to worship a film deity, they may also be witnessing the twilight of India’s cinematic gods.\n \n\n   \n  “As stars become more relatable and fandom less devotional, the star-fan contract is less sacrosanct today,” said a recent IMDb report analyzing the last 25 years of Indian cinema.\n \n\n   \n  In today’s fractured attention economy of streaming, the barbed wire of polarizing politics, and the cacophony of social media, winning adoration on this scale isn’t just difficult; it might be impossible.\n \n\n   \n  As the IMDb report put it: “It’s time to stop searching for the next Shah Rukh Khan.”\n \n\n   \n  In 1991, the government dismantled the protectionist economic policies of its socialist past, cracking open the nation to the world. It was a policy shift that ignited a period of economic growth and industrial expansion that essentially reshaped the country. Satellite television brought a plethora of choice into the living room, Western brands began to appear in shops and, for a burgeoning middle class, the definition of success was suddenly rewritten.\n \n\n   \n  An exhilarating mantra became mainstream: Anyone can make it.\n \n\n   \n  Into this moment stepped Khan.\n \n\n   \n  A Muslim boy from a middle-class Delhi neighborhood, Khan says he was shaped by a household rich in intellect but often short on cash.\n \n\n   \n  His father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was a lawyer and Indian independence activist from Peshawar, in modern-day Pakistan, who ran a series of failed businesses. His mother, Lateef Fatima, was the family’s anchor, according to the younger Khan.\n \n\n   \n  “I come from a very normal lower-middle-class family. I saw a lot of failure,” he  said  during a 2012 speech at Yale University. “My father was a beautiful man and the most successful failure in the world… We were quite poor actually and let me tell you… poverty entails fear and stress and sometimes depression.”\n \n\n   \n  He began acting in school plays. By the age of 23, he was already on television in the successful series “Fauji” (Soldier). But just as his career was taking flight, his personal world fell apart.\n \n\n   \n  The death of his mother, years after he lost his father, prompted a move to Mumbai, the heart of India’s film industry.\n \n\n   \n  “I was sad in Delhi,” Khan told CNN in a 2008 interview. “I said to myself: OK, come (to Mumbai) for a change of scene. Maybe I’ll enjoy myself for a year and get over my depression of my parents’ death. But I just I couldn’t go back… I was never trying to be a movie star, I became one by chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Khan made his big-screen debut in the 1992 romantic drama “Deewana” (Obsessed) and soon became known for playing villainous, menacing characters in films like “Darr” (Fear) and “Baazigar” (Gambler). But it was his pivot to the romantic hero in the 1995 cult hit “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” (The Brave Hearted Will Take the Bride, widely known as DDLJ) that catapulted him to superstardom.\n \n\n   \n  His character, Raj, presented a new model of masculinity that wasn’t the angry young man of the previous generation. He was the empathetic partner for the new one, offering a vision of modern love that felt safe and aspirational.\n \n\n   \n  Bollywood certainly has other megastars, like Deepika Padukone, who is among India’s most celebrated women actors; Aamir Khan, known for his versatility; and Salman Khan. Yet, their followings are distinct from the quasi-religious fervor thar surrounds Khan.\n \n\n   \n  It is a phenomenon of near-mythic proportions, engendering a devotion so profound as to lead to the scenes of mass pilgrimage outside Khan’s Mumbai home.\n \n\n   \n  Sher Mohammed had traveled 2,200 kilometers from his village in the eastern state of Jharkhand and waited 95 days for a chance to meet Khan. When Khan learned of Mohammed’s determined vigil, he came out to the street to personally greet his fan.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone told me I won’t be able to meet him… I got even more motivated to meet him,” Mohammed said. “I felt so happy.”\n \n\n   \n  Also present was Visharukh, Khan’s self-proclaimed “biggest fan,” whose home is plastered with posters of the actor, and whose children are named “Simran” and “Aryan” – after Khan’s love interest in “DDLJ” and his real-life son, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Visharukh’s shrine to Khan is just one thread in an intricate tapestry of fandom.\n \n\n   \n  In her book, “Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh,” author Shrayana Bhattacharya explores what he means to women as someone who challenged masculinity in a newly liberalized economy.\n \n\n   \n  “For 15 years, I thought I was talking to fans about Khan,” she said. “Eventually, he became a research device for hundreds of his female fans to use his icon to talk about their own frustrated attempts to assert economic and emotional independence in one of world’s most insidious patriarchies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Bhattacharya, there is no single explanation for his appeal.\n \n\n   \n  For a migrant tribal domestic worker, for instance, she found the appeal wasn’t rooted in grand romance. She most appreciated his characters’ willingness to participate in domestic life, Bhattacharya said, citing “simple gestures such as being in the kitchen in his films, helping with chores.”\n \n\n   \n  For the nation’s elites, Bhattacharya found Khan symbolized something entirely different. He was a living embodiment of the dream that hard work could lead to limitless success. He represented, as she put it, “the myth of meritocracy at a time when India started its love affair with GDP growth and consumer spending.”\n \n\n   \n  And for another crucial group – the first generation of women to ever work in their families – she found his films offered a vital refuge. Khan’s imagery became a “necessary entertainment and escape when their everyday rebellion of prioritizing a career over marriage caused heartbreak or exhaustion,” Bhattacharya said.\n \n\n   \n  “He is one person, but each fan has projected their aspirations and fantasies onto him in their own unique and deeply diverse ways.”\n \n\n   \n  But in today’s world of digital creators, those seeking fame face competition in a way Khan’s generation never could have imagined.\n \n\n   \n  This new reality is the daily grind for Shivam Khatri, an aspiring actor in Mumbai. He, too, left his small town for the city of dreams, but his hustle operates in a different universe. For him, the formula has been inverted: where Khan became a star and then a brand, actors now must become a brand first.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like someone gets picked up from the street,” Khatri said from the home he shares with several other people. “Social media, web shows, it’s changed everything.”\n \n\n   \n  The influence of stardom in India is immense. Cultivated over years through a series of box-office hits, it can define eras, create cultural touchstones, and command a loyal fanbase that transcends generations.\n \n\n   \n  But the very nature of the connection between stars and their audience is now evolving, according to the IMDb report.\n \n\n   \n  “What was once a carefully mediated connection, built through iconic characters and controlled narratives, has become more porous,” it said. “The closing of the metaphorical gap between the big screen’s larger-than-life star and the one on the (Instagram) reel you can hold in your hand has changed the equation between the star and the fan.”\n \n\n   \n  Khatri knows his follower count is as important as his headshot as he competes not just with actors but with food bloggers, comedians and dancers for screen time. “Everyone should have an online presence now,” he said, “and you have to constantly check it.”\n \n\n   \n  His struggle illustrates how the singular path to box-office fame has been replaced by a thousand algorithm-driven streams on social media apps like Instagram and TikTok.\n \n\n   \n  For Ibrahim Qadri, a Khan lookalike and social media influencer from Gujarat, it pays to trade on the existing fame of others, supplying a demand for connection that the real SRK could never sate.\n \n\n   \n  His Instagram feed is a meticulous recreation of Khan’s world: the signature arm-spread pose in a mustard field, a lip-sync to a classic song, a frame-by-frame remake of a famous movie scene. He is, in many ways, more accessible than the real Khan, making a living through brand deals with local businesses and paid appearances at weddings.\n \n\n   \n  “When I perform, I don’t think I’m imitating,” Qadri said. “I become him. I feel like I am him.”\n \n\n   \n  This profound devotion, which has garnered him more than 2 million followers, comes with a paradox: He might be the only person in India who doesn’t want to meet Khan.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve said that many times,” Qadri explains. “Because if I meet him, I feel my passion will end… what will be left to do in life?”\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t talk about Hindu-Muslim,” he once said in a 2020 interview in Hindi. “My wife is Hindu, I’m a Muslim, and our children are Hindustan (Indian).”\n \n\n   \n  But in today’s era of political polarization, defined by a new wave of Hindu nationalism, that same identity has been weaponized, transforming him from a unifying symbol into a cultural battleground.\n \n\n   \n  The 2023 release of his action film “Pathaan” (Warrior) served as a flashpoint. The brief appearance in a musical sequence of a female actor in a saffron bikini – a color associated with Hinduism – ignited a coordinated firestorm of outrage from far-right groups and politicians, who framed it as a deliberate insult to the religion.\n \n\n   \n  Calls for a nationwide boycott trended for weeks, and effigies of the actor were burned,  according  to local media reports. But the film’s eventual record-breaking success was a deafening rebuttal from his loyal fanbase.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if there will be another SRK or not,” said the author Bhattacharya. “What I do know is that we will need icons who unite us in conversation, not divide us into spiritual silos.”\n \n\n   \n  Back at the birthday congregation in Mumbai, a sea of fans surges outside Khan’s home. As the day wears on, the crowd swells to a formidable throng. Police struggle to maintain order, their wooden sticks cracking against the pavement in a futile attempt to control the sheer mass of people.\n \n\n   \n  Afternoon bleeds into evening, and as the sun sets over the Arabian Sea, the collective hope that they’ll see their hero   begins to fade. A message appears on X, confirming their disappointment. “Have been advised by authorities that I will not be able to step out and greet all you lovely people who have been waiting for me,” Khan writes, adding his “deepest apologies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Khatri, the aspiring actor, there will never be another like Khan.\n \n\n   \n  You have to almost be delusional to make it in the industry, he says. “It’s fun until the money runs out… It’s not going to happen in the next 10 days or months. But it will work out.”\n \n\n   \n  Inspired by Khan, a vision board in the corner of his room reads: “India’s next superstar.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/health/enlicitide-cholesterol-lowering-drug-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Experimental daily pill may lower cholesterol in patients who don’t see enough benefit with statins alone, study finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new Phase 3 clinical trial has shown that enlicitide, an experimental oral PCSK9 inhibitor, significantly reduces LDL cholesterol—by up to 60%—in adults with high cholesterol who are already on statin therapy.

For these patients, a new experimental pill could offer some hope.\n \n\n   \n  Phase 3 trial data found that people who took the investigational drug enlicitide with their routine cholesterol-lowering regimen, like statins, saw up to a 60% reduction in their LDL or “bad” cholesterol after 24 weeks of daily treatment, according to a  news release  about the results.  ﻿ That was in comparison with people who took a placebo along with their routine cholesterol-lowering medications. All study participants had high levels of LDL cholesterol and a history of either a major cardiovascular disease event, or they were at an increased risk for one.\n \n\n   \n  The new results, which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, were presented Saturday at the  American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions .\n \n\n   \n  Having high cholesterol in the blood can lead to a buildup called “plaque” on the walls of the arteries, raising the risk of cardiovascular disease. Heart disease is the  leading cause of death  in the United States. It’s estimated that  one person dies every 34 seconds  from cardiovascular disease in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Merck, the pharmaceutical company behind enlicitide, plans to apply for US Food and Drug Administration approval of enlicitide early next year, said Dr. Puja Banka, the company’s associate vice president of clinical research and global clinical development.\n \n\n   \n  “We wanted to show what enlicitide can deliver on top of statins, because we know that  70% of patients  that are treated with lipid-lowering therapies still don’t reach their guideline-directed goals,” Banka said about the new data. “So, the idea is really to show what we can achieve with enlicitide on top of statins.”\n \n\n   \n    When statins alone are not enough\n \n\n   \n  The new Phase 3 trial included 2,912 adults, with an average age of 63, who either had a previous heart attack or stroke or were at intermediate or high risk of a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years. Data were collected across 14 countries between August 2023 and July 2025.\n \n\n   \n  All of the adults in the study had elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite being on a stable course of lipid-lowering therapy like statins for 30 days or more. About 97% of them were taking statins and 26% were also taking another type of medication to help lower cholesterol levels – and they all continued these therapies during the study.\n \n\n   \n  But as an additional treatment, some of the adults were administered a once-daily pill of enlicitide and others were given a placebo.\n \n\n   \n  Enlicitide is a type of cholesterol-lowering drug known as a PCSK9 inhibitor, which works by helping to clear “bad” LDL cholesterol out of the bloodstream. On the other hand, statins lower LDL cholesterol by blocking an enzyme in the liver, which then forces the liver to remove more LDL cholesterol from the body.\n \n\n   \n  “Thus, it might be expected that adding enlicitide that works by a different mechanism to statins could further reduce LDL cholesterol,” Dr. Kristin Newby, a cardiologist and professor at Duke University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers found that after 24 weeks, the adults taking enlicitide not only saw up to a 60% reduction in LDL cholesterol, but reductions were sustained through 52 weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The adults taking enlicitide also showed a 53% reduction in a combination of all other cholesterol except for “good” HDL cholesterol; a 50% decrease in ApoB, a protein that helps carry fat and various “bad” types of cholesterol throughout the body; and a 28% drop in a type of fat in the body known as  lipoprotein(a) .\n \n\n   \n  As for the safety of the drug, about 10% of the adults taking enlicitide experienced serious adverse events during the study and a similar share, about 12%, of those taking a placebo experienced adverse events in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, the side effects were balanced between the enlicitide arm and the placebo arm,” Banka said. “There wasn’t a particular adverse event that stands out as imbalanced between the two.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of the adverse events reported in the trial were gastrointestinal disorders and certain infections, but the occurrence of these events was similar across both groups.\n \n\n   \n  “This provides some reasonable assurance of no major or high frequency adverse events or side effects,” said Newby, who is an expert with the American Heart Association.\n \n\n   \n  “However, similar to other new therapeutics, larger outcomes studies and post-marketing surveillance will be needed to identify any low frequency adverse effects that might occur,” Newby said. “The major benefit that is clear from this study is that enlicitide is very efficacious at lowering LDL cholesterol (by about 55%) compared with placebo on a background of statin therapy, and secondarily, it helps more people reach their LDL cholesterol treatment goal than with statins alone.”\n \n\n   \n    Expanding options for patients\n \n\n   \n  For people with high LDL cholesterol who may not respond sufficiently to commonly used treatments like statins alone, there is already the option to take injectable cholesterol-lowering  PCSK9 inhibitor s that are currently on the market.\n \n\n   \n  But a key difference between the PCSK9 inhibitors already on the market and the experimental enlicitide medication is that those currently on the market are administered as an injection.\n \n\n   \n  “Whereas enlicitide is an oral medication taken daily. Thus, offering an option in route and frequency of administration that may be preferable to some patients,” Newby said.\n \n\n   \n  Banka described enlicitide as the “first oral PCSK9 inhibitor to complete Phase 3 trials.”\n \n\n   \n  One new study has demonstrated that a PCSK9 inhibitor already on the market can  reduce major cardiovascular disease events  in adults with no prior heart attack or stroke.\n \n\n   \n  Adding the injectable PCSK9 inhibitor  evolocumab  — sold as Repatha —   to a cholesterol-lowering treatment regimen was found to reduce the risk of a first-time major cardiovascular event among adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or diabetes, according to a separate study presented Saturday at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was conducted across 33 countries between June 2019 and November 2021, and it included 12,257 adults, with an average age of 66. The adults were randomly separated into two groups. One group received evolocumab injections under the skin every two weeks while the other group received injections of a placebo every two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The data showed that, after an average of 4.6 years, adults in the evolocumab group saw a 25% reduced risk of coronary heart disease deaths, heart attack or ischemic stroke, compared with those in the placebo group.\n \n\n   \n  In the United States, evolocumab injection already has been  approved by the FDA . The  medication is indicated  to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in adults with established cardiovascular disease as well as to be used as an  “add-on” treatment for certain forms of high cholesterol .\n \n\n   \n  The latest trial results represent “the first demonstration of improved cardiovascular outcomes with a PCSK9 inhibitor, or any non-statin for that matter, in patients without a previous heart attack or stroke who are already being treated with a high-intensity lipid-lowering regimen,” lead study author Dr. Erin Bohula, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Brigham & Women’s Hospital and an investigator with the TIMI Study Group, said in a news release on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “Together with data from genetic studies of PCSK9 variants and other PCSK9 inhibitor outcomes studies, our findings suggest that long-term lowering with PCSK9 inhibitors can help to improve cardiovascular morbidity and potentially mortality over time,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/06/tech/openai-backtracks-government-support-chip-investments","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"09:32:00-05:00","title":"Why OpenAI Went Into Crisis PR Mode Thursday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"OpenAI faced a major public relations crisis when CFO Sarah Friar suggested the U.S. government should provide a financial backstop for OpenAI’s $1.4 trillion investment in AI infrastructure.

Thursday \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:32 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  OpenAI, the world’s leader in AI and ChatGPT parent company, went into panic mode on Thursday over what it said was a very public misstatement.\n \n\n   \n  Two top executives furiously backtracked from an earlier comment that suggested OpenAI might need government support to cover the $1.4 trillion in chips and data center infrastructure it’s committed to buying.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how the situation unfolded and why the since-retracted comment was so controversial.\n \n\n   \n    What OpenAI’s CFO said\n \n\n   \n  OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar raised eyebrows on Wednesday when she suggested that the US government should “backstop” the company’s aggressive investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  “The backstop, the guarantee, that allows the financing to happen, that can really drop the cost of the financing but also increase the loan-to-value, so the amount of debt that you can take on top of an equity portion,” she said  at a Wall Street Journal event .\n \n\n   \n  In other words: a federal government “backstop” for the debt AI companies take on to make chip investments.\n \n\n   \n  Friar quickly walked back the comments, clarifying in a  LinkedIn post  that the government needed to “play their part” in combination with the private sector to contribute to America’s AI growth. But OpenAI was “not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments.”\n \n\n   \n  But that may have confused matters even further and added to a chorus of questions that have been growing in recent weeks about how the not-yet-profitable startup plans to pay for its AI data center and chip commitments.\n \n\n   \n    Why was this so controversial?\n \n\n   \n  Friar’s initial comment took heat because it seemed to imply that the US government — and thus, taxpayers — should be on the hook if OpenAI can’t figure out how to pay for all the chips it has said it will buy. Like, how your parents who co-signed on your lease would be responsible if you didn’t pay your rent.\n \n\n   \n  And that didn’t sit well with many people, given that OpenAI is a private company valued at $500 billion, from which taxpayers wouldn’t be seeing any direct benefit if it succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  “Will there be a political movement to forgive AI chip loans like student loans? Can OpenAI wind up in conservatorship like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?” Jones Trading chief market strategist Mike O’Rourke wrote in emailed commentary Wednesday. “It is absurd that OpenAI insiders think the U.S. government should furnish them with preferential borrowing rates while they get to grow the value of their privately held shares on the backs of American taxpayers.”\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, the comments seemed to suggest — as many investors and Silicon Valley watchers have  worried in recent months  — that OpenAI isn’t quite sure how it will pay for its $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments without some creative maneuvering. That would be an issue for everyone, since it has been on a  dealmaking spree  with Nvidia, AMD, Amazon and others, helping to prop up the stock market.\n \n\n   \n    OpenAI CEO Sam Altman weighs in\n \n\n   \n  By Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stepped in to try to further clarify the company’s position on a government backstop. He revealed that the company expects to earn $20 billion in revenue this year and plans to grow to “hundreds of billions” in annual revenue by 2030 with investments in things like enterprise AI and consumer devices.\n \n\n   \n  Altman reiterated that the company “does not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.”\n \n\n   \n  “We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market,” Altman said in an X  post .\n \n\n   \n  The government could consider, however, investing in its own data centers and guarantee loans for building new US chip fabrication plants, he said. The White House has pushed tech giants to do just that to protect national security.\n \n\n   \n  “If we screw up and can’t fix it, we should fail, and other companies will continue on doing good work and servicing customers,” Altman said. “That’s how capitalism works and the ecosystem and economy would be fine.”\n \n\n   \n    How does Trump factor into all this?\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has said that building new AI infrastructure and ensuring that America wins the global AI race are national priorities. His administration has  committed to  pulling back on AI regulations and streamlining permitting for new data centers and energy infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s AI Czar David Sacks said on X Thursday that “there will be no federal bailout for AI,” adding that if one AI company fails, “others will take its place.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/europe/six-killed-fire-perfume-depot-turkey-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"08:09:00-04:00","title":"Six killed in fire at perfume depot in northwestern Turkey","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fire at a perfume depot in Kocaeli province, northwestern Turkey, killed six people and injured one on Saturday morning.

I didn’t do a lot of support for the other candidate [in New Jersey]. They asked me about [New York City mayoral candidate Andrew] Cuomo, and I said, well, it’s a question – do you want a thug or do you want a communist?\n \n\n   \n  “So I wasn’t involved in that stuff too much.”\n \n\n   \n  But however you want to characterize Trump’s role in Tuesday’s  off-year elections  in Virginia and New Jersey, there is no question they were about him.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the results appear to have been more of a direct rebuke to Trump than any previous election that didn’t actually feature him on the ballot.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps one of the biggest lessons of this week is that the anti-Trump vote appears stronger than ever. And, as notably, the pro-Trump vote appears as weak as ever.\n \n\n   \n  Even before the election, this was perhaps my biggest takeaway from the  CNN poll  released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  It showed 41% of registered voters said that if they were voting for Congress today, their vote would be meant to show opposition to Trump. Meanwhile, just 21% said their vote would be meant to show support for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  So about twice as many anti-Trump votes as pro-Trump ones.\n \n\n   \n  That’s not normal. While unpopular presidents are not exactly uncommon these days, that was actually the biggest such gap in CNN polling in nearly 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  The last time twice as many voters viewed their vote in a non-presidential election as opposing rather than supporting the president was in 2006. At the time, 36% of registered voters viewed their vote as against George W. Bush, while just 15% viewed it as pro-Bush. (Republicans got shellacked in that election.)\n \n\n   \n  The numbers weren’t quite as pronounced ahead of Trump’s first midterm election, in 2018, when 38% of voters described their votes as anti-Trump, versus 25% who were pro-Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Okay, that’s national polling. So, did this show up on Tuesday in the election? It sure did.\n \n\n   \n  While we didn’t have a nationwide election, the exit-poll data we do have from the key states suggests the anti-Trump vote was stronger than before.\n \n\n   \n  The gap between anti-Trump votes and pro-Trump votes in Virginia went from 17 points in 2017 (34%-17%) to 22 points on Tuesday (38%-16%).\n \n\n   \n  It grew even more in New Jersey, going from 17 points in 2017 (28%-11%) to 28 points this time (41%-13%).\n \n\n   \n  And 2017 was the worst-polling year of Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  The gaps between anti- and pro-Trump votes in these states were also significantly larger than they were nationally in either the 2018 or 2022 midterms, when both measured at 12 points. (Trump was out of office in 2022, of course, but he still loomed large in American politics.)\n \n\n   \n  That’s not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, given Virginia and New Jersey lean modestly to the left. (Trump lost both states in 2024 by 6 points.) But it’s not like these are deep-blue states, either.\n \n\n   \n  And New Jersey is a state Trump and his allies have tried to pitch as a swing state in the making. Yet there were three times as many anti-Trump voters there Tuesday as pro-Trump ones.\n \n\n   \n  All of which suggests a couple things.\n \n\n   \n  The first is that the massive size of the  “No Kings” rallies  was no fluke. The anti-Trump movement appears as strong, motivated and robust as ever. Its adherents might not be keen on the Democratic Party these days, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t engaged and even prepared to vote.\n \n\n   \n  The second point hasn’t gotten as much attention. And that’s that, for all of Trump’s huge power grabs and his political domination of the Republican Party, his base actually doesn’t seem terribly enthused right now.\n \n\n   \n  Just 1 in 5 registered voters said in the CNN poll ahead of the election that their vote would be intended to support Trump. It was even less than that in New Jersey and Virginia on Election Day, according to CNN’s exit polls\n \n\n   \n  These are not the numbers of an all-powerful, domineering force whose actions are beloved by half the country and who can marshal voters to the polls when he decides to get more involved.\n \n\n   \n  And it suggests there’s something to the data we’re seeing where Trump’s base isn’t exactly gung-ho about some of his policies. I wrote about this back in July – the idea that there was  something of a “malaise” setting in on the right . It looks like that’s a real electoral problem for Trump and the GOP now.\n \n\n   \n  Whatever the case, these numbers are worth paying close attention to moving forward.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-search-update","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00-05:00","title":"Wig disguises, a swapped license plate and a 1,000-mile drive: Where the search for 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard stands","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melodee Buzzard, a 9-year-old girl from Lompoc, California, went missing in October 2025 after school officials noticed her prolonged absence from a remote study program.

search for Melodee , they say their probe has uncovered a series of wigged disguises, a sprawling multistate road trip, and an “uncooperative” mother who has provided “no verifiable explanation” of her daughter’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  The case took an unexpected turn on Friday when  Buzzard, 40, was arrested  on a charge of false imprisonment – but not for the disappearance of her daughter. “This crime is not connected to the ongoing search for Melodee, however, detectives are unable to fully outline the crime as it would impede their ongoing investigation,” the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the case – and the many questions that still remain.\n \n\n   \n    A concerned school official noticed Melodee’s ‘prolonged absence’\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on October 14, not by her family but by school administrators who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in.\n \n\n   \n  School district officials in the child’s hometown of Lompoc say Melodee was enrolled in August in an independent study program, which allows students to learn from home. That was  the last month  she was seen by the school, the sheriff’s office has said.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear whether the school last saw Melodee virtually or in person, but the sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  The school’s August sighting helped narrow detectives’ timeline at the beginning of the investigation, when authorities were working with outdated childhood photos and family members who said they had not seen Melodee for years.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years. The aunt said their extended family largely lost contact with the child after her father died in a motorcycle accident when she was a baby.\n \n\n   \n  When Melodee’s school asked for a welfare check on October 14, officers arrived at her mother’s home but only found Buzzard, who “provided  no verifiable explanation  for Melodee’s whereabouts,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found.\n \n\n   \n  The  sheriff’s office  said this week Buzzard “has remained uncooperative and has not confirmed Melodee’s location or welfare.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n    Melodee likely disappeared during a whirlwind multistate road trip\n \n\n   \n  Detectives have narrowed their investigation to a small but very eventful three-day window from October 7-10, in which they believe the mother drove Melodee more than 1,000 miles away – as far as Nebraska – crossing at least six states and trading license plates and disguises as they went.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the three-day trip, Buzzard returned home with the rental car, this time without Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  The last time Melodee was seen was on October 9 in an area around the Colorado and Utah state line. Here’s what  investigators say happened  on their trip:\n \n\n   \n  Finding Melodee now hinges on detectives unearthing what happened to the girl after she was last seen on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office released a  travel-route map  of where they believe the mother and daughter traveled between October 9 and 10, and is asking businesses, gas stations, hotels, rest stops and residents along the route to review surveillance camera footage that may catch a glimpse of the child.\n \n\n   \n    A series of wigs may have provided quick disguises, investigators say\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who came across the mother and daughter may not recognize them in some publicly released pictures, as authorities believe Buzzard may have taken steps to conceal their identities, including tucking her daughter’s ringlet curls under a smooth wig.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc on October 7 showed Buzzard and Melodee in what appeared to be wigs, the sheriff’s office said in a release that  shared a clip  of the video.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next three days, authorities say Buzzard appeared to swap wigs, trading fake, honey blonde curls for a darker wig closer to the style Melodee was seen in.\n \n\n   \n  “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel,” the release said.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s grandmother, Lilly Denes, told CNN affiliate  KSBY  that when she first saw the surveillance images, she was overwhelmed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was totally numb and in shock. … This is just so shocking to me in that my granddaughter is dressed in a disguise,” Denes told the affiliate.\n \n\n   \n  “If she’s listening, we love you. We’re here for you, and we just want you to be happy,” the grandmother said. “Call me. There are numbers on the TV that you can call, and I will come pick you up.”\n \n\n   \n    Mother is accused of falsely imprisoning someone in unrelated charge\n \n\n   \n  In a sudden turn of events on Friday, the sheriff’s office  announced  while they were investigating Melodee’s disappearance, they learned her mother had recently “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  “Although this arrest occurred during the course of the missing person investigation, it is not directly related to Melodee’s disappearance,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard  was arrested Friday  on a charge of false imprisonment, a felony charge, and investigators have been reluctant to provide details about the incident while they search for Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard will be booked at a Santa Barbara County jail with bail set at $100,000, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest comes about a week after the  FBI served search warrants  at Buzzard’s home and a storage locker, as well as the rental car Melodee was last seen in.\n \n\n   \n  But the sheriff’s office declined to provide the identity of the victim of the alleged false imprisonment.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheriff’s detectives remain fully focused on locating Melodee and confirming her safety,” the Friday release said.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who has seen Melodee or may have information about her whereabouts is encouraged to call the sheriff’s office or leave  an anonymous tip .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/health/cholesterol-gene-edit-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"09:56:00-05:00","title":"Scientists have edited a gene that may reduce high cholesterol permanently","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A small pilot study using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to target the ANGPTL3 gene has shown promising results in reducing both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides by nearly 50% and 55% respectively in 15 patients with severe hyperlipidemia.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:56 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With a snip of a gene, doctors may one day permanently lower dangerously  high cholesterol,  possibly removing the need for medication, according to a new pilot study published Saturday in the  New England Journal of Medicine .\n \n\n   \n  The study was extremely small — only 15 patients with severe disease — and was meant to test the safety of a new medication delivered by CRISPR-Cas9, a biological sort of scissor which cuts a targeted gene to modify or turn it on or off.\n \n\n   \n  Preliminary results, however, showed nearly a 50% reduction in  low-density lipoprotein , or LDL, the “bad” cholesterol which plays a major role in heart disease — the No.1 killer of adults in the  United States  and  worldwide .\n \n\n   \n  The study, which will be presented Saturday at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in New Orleans, also found an average 55% reduction in  triglycerides , a different type of fat in the blood that is also linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope this is a permanent solution, where younger people with severe disease can undergo a ‘one and done’ gene therapy and have reduced LDL and triglycerides for the rest of their lives,” said senior study author Dr. Steven Nissen, chief academic officer of the Sydell and Arnold Miller Family Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s a dream come true,” Nissen said. “If you’d asked me 15 years ago if we could have done something like this, I would have thought you were crazy,”\n \n\n   \n  Today, cardiologists want people with existing heart disease or those born with a predisposition for hard-to-control cholesterol to lower their LDL well below 100, which is the average in the US, said Dr. Pradeep Natarajan, director of preventive cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n \n\n   \n  “There is evidence to suggest that the optimal cholesterol level is 40 to 50, which is very hard to do through diet and lifestyle,” said Natarajan, who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, today’s medications can already lower LDL cholesterol to the levels found in the study — in fact, some medicines are a little more potent,” he said. “So we’re going to have to wait and see if this treatment works as well as this first study suggests.”\n \n\n   \n  While early, the findings are exciting due to the difficulty of remembering to take a daily medication — and sometimes three or four — to control high cholesterol levels, said preventive cardiologist Dr. Ann Marie Navar, an associate professor of cardiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “In spite of having a lot of available therapies, the majority of people do not have their LDL under control,” said Navar, who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re 20 and you have really high cholesterol, it may make a lot more sense to have a one-time treatment that doesn’t require you to have to take a pill every single day or shot every two weeks for the next 60 years,” she said. “The potential for this is just enormous.”\n \n\n   \n    A lucky mutation to reduce high cholesterol\n \n\n   \n  The idea for a gene-editing treatment came from an unusual source — a genetic mutation. In that scenario, the ANGPTL3, or angiopoietin-like protein 3 gene, which is responsible for regulating LDL and triglycerides is shut off.\n \n\n   \n  People with a nonfunctioning ANGPTL3 gene  — which Natarajan says applies to about 1 in 250 people in the US — have lifelong levels of low LDL cholesterol and triglycerides without any apparent negative consequences. They also have exceedingly low or no risk for cardiovascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a naturally occurring mutation that’s protective against cardiovascular disease,”  said Nissen, who holds the Lewis and Patricia Dickey Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine at Cleveland Clinic. “And now that CRISPR is here, we have the ability to change other people’s genes so they too can have this protection.”\n \n\n   \n  Various doses of the CRISPR-based drug were given to study participants by infusion: One set of people received a very tiny dose of 0.1 milligrams per kilogram, while others received levels from 0.3 to 0.8 milligrams per kilogram, said lead study author Dr. Luke Laffin, a preventive cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic’s Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “The average 55% decrease in triglycerides and nearly 50% in LDL cholesterol occurred at the highest dose,” Laffin said. “That’s exciting because there are no therapies available now that simultaneously lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.”\n \n\n   \n  There was a small decrease in HDL (high density lipoprotein), which is known as “good” cholesterol. However the drop in HDL is also found in people with the ANGPTL3 mutation and doesn’t appear to be harmful, Laffin said.\n \n\n   \n  “The most common disorder that we see in our prevention clinic is mixed hyperlipidemia —people who have trouble controlling both their LDL and triglycerides,” Nissen said. “So to be able to do this simultaneously is really an important development.”\n \n\n   \n    Long-term safety profile\n \n\n   \n  In people with the natural mutation, the ANGPTL3 gene is turned off in every cell in the body — muscles, heart, lungs and so forth. The new medication, however, targets only the liver, the organ responsible for synthesizing triglycerides and producing cholesterol while also removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n \n\n   \n  That’s reassuring for the long-term safety of the drug’s impact, Nissen said, making it less likely that genes in other parts of the body could also be edited.\n \n\n   \n  Side effects of the initial treatment were minimal, mostly irritation at infusion sites, according to the study. One person suffered a spinal disk herniation, and another had an increase in enzymes that could signal liver damage, but those levels resolved within two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  However, one person died six months after the infusion: “He had extensive, advanced cardiovascular disease, and he got the tiniest 0.1 dose, a dose that doesn’t do anything,” Nissen said.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t think that his death has any implications to the study at all,” he said. “In addition, the FDA has recommended these people be followed after the trials are all over for 15 years to see if there are long term adverse effects. That will be done, and it’s the right thing.”\n \n\n   \n  Phase 2 clinical trials will begin soon, quickly followed by Phase 3 trials, which are designed to show the effect of the drug on a larger population, Nissen said.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope to do all this by the end of next year,” Nissen said. “We’re moving very fast because this is a huge unmet medical need — millions of people have these disorders and many of them are not on treatment or have stopped treatment for whatever reason. That’s a huge under treatment issue here in the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, this is early days, and there have been similar drugs which looked promising at the beginning but were later rejected due to safety concerns, Nadar said.\n \n\n   \n  “The most important take home message is if you’re on a cholesterol lowering medication, stay on it,” she said. “All the data show the longer you lower your LDL cholesterol, the better your outcome. Someone who lowers their LDL from 100 to 30 for a only year is going to be far less protected than someone who lowered their cholesterol from 100 to 50 for a lifetime.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/supreme-court-rastafarian-man-dreadlocks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court to hear case of Rastafarian man seeking to sue prison officials for cutting his dreadlocks","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian, was shaved of his dreadlocks in 2020 at Raymond Laborde Correctional Center in Louisiana after prison officials challenged the legitimacy of his religious beliefs.

Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two things went very wrong when Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian, was transferred to a prison in central Louisiana five years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The first is that prison guards handcuffed Landor to a chair and  shaved off the knee-length dreadlocks  he had grown over nearly two decades. The second is that, minutes earlier, guards took a court decision requiring prisons to allow dreadlocks for Rastafarians and tossed it into the trash.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court will hear arguments in an important religious rights case Monday that will decide whether Landor – and other prisoners whose beliefs are violated – may sue prison officials for damages.\n \n\n   \n  “In an instant, they stripped Landor of decades of consistent religious practice and a defining feature of his identity,” his lawyers said in written arguments this year. “That is shocking, offensive, and lawless.”\n \n\n   \n  Few cases arrive at the Supreme Court with a set of facts and a legal question more tailor-made for a conservative 6-3 majority that has in recent years consistently backed religious claims. Even the Louisiana officials opposing Landor’s case have condemned how he was treated.\n \n\n   \n  In a similar case just five years ago,  the court ruled 8-0  in favor of a group of Muslim Americans who said federal agents had placed them on a no-fly list because they refused to act as informants.\n \n\n   \n  But the question for the justices is not whether Landor’s head should have been shaved, but rather whether he can claim money damages.\n \n\n   \n  A panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals  ruled that Landor was not entitled to sue  under a 25-year-old law intended to protect prisoners’ religious interests.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative New Orleans-based 5th Circuit said that it “emphatically” condemned “the treatment that Landor endured,” but an earlier appeals court precedent settled the case against him. The full 5th Circuit ultimately  decided against  rehearing the case.\n \n\n   \n  “Religious liberty is deeply important, and Louisiana has laws on the books protecting it,” said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican. But, she said, “ten federal courts of appeals have held” that the law “does not allow prisoners to sue prison officials in their personal capacities for damages.”\n \n\n   \n  Landor, who began serving a five-month prison sentence in 2020 for drug possession, had previously taken a promise known as the Nazarite vow to not cut his hair.\n \n\n   \n  He had been incarcerated without incident at two other facilities before he was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center with only a few weeks left in his sentence. And he came armed with a copy of an appeals court ruling from 2017 that allowed prisoners to have dreadlocks.\n \n\n   \n  His guards were unpersuaded. The warden asked Landor to hand over documents from his sentencing judge to verify his religious beliefs. When Landor couldn’t immediately produce them, he was escorted into another room, according to court documents, and shaved.\n \n\n   \n  Landor’s prison ID photo taken that day, according to legal papers, shows him bald.\n \n\n   \n  Landor’s case at the Supreme Court rests on the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA. Congress passed that law, and another that dealt with religious accommodation more widely, in response to a landmark but controversial 1990 precedent from the court. Five years ago, the  justices ruled that the other law , which has nearly identical language, does allow people whose religious rights have been burdened to seek damages against government officials acting in their individual capacity.\n \n\n   \n  But Louisiana counters that RLUIPA is a spending contract between the federal government, which provides funding for state prisons, and state officials.

      8:42 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Donald Trump has granted Hungary a one-year exemption from US sanctions for buying Russian oil and gas, a White House official told CNN Friday, after Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán met the US President in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  For months, Trump has berated European Union countries for continuing to buy oil and gas from Russia, saying this helps fuel the Kremlin’s war machine and prolong the  war in Ukraine  that he has been at pains to end.\n \n\n   \n  But when Orbán – whose country buys more Russian oil and gas than any other EU nation – showed up at the White House on Friday, Trump was full of praise for the “great leader” of a “great country,” claiming it has been “difficult” for Hungary to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, since it is landlocked.\n \n\n   \n  For Orbán, a darling of the MAGA movement, the carve-out has spared Hungary from the violent economic shock it was facing after the Trump administration last month put sanctions on two Russian oil giants. Before those sanctions were announced, Orbán had told Trump, his longtime ally, that cutting Russian energy supplies would bring Hungary’s economy “to its knees.”\n \n\n   \n  The exemption for Hungary will raise questions about the Trump administration’s seriousness in enforcing its sanctions on Russia’s oil exports. Analysts warn that Trump’s cutting his allies some slack will embolden others to try to circumvent US sanctions, eroding their ability to inflict economic pain on Russia and hasten the end of its war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “The US decision is a terrible and unnecessary mistake that will allow over 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to flow into the Kremlin’s war chest,” Isaac Levi, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), told CNN. “By carving out special treatment for Hungary, Washington is telling other buyers that they can keep handling Russian oil and still expect to be let off the hook.”\n \n\n   \n  Levi also questioned the Trump administration’s rationale for the exemption, pointing to how the Czech Republic, another landlocked country, manages without Russian crude oil and has lower fuel prices at the pump than Hungary. “This clearly shows that the oil flows that continue to finance Putin’s war in Ukraine are entirely unnecessary,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Orbán is also hoping that Trump might re-open the door to a summit with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, which the US president announced last month, but which was soon shelved. Trump said Friday that his team was talking with Orbán about meeting with Putin.\n \n\n   \n  In a press conference before the lunch with Orbán, Trump expressed sympathy for Hungary’s energy insecurity since “they don’t have ports, and so they have a difficult problem,” he said. The president added that he was “disturbed” that other European countries that “don’t have those problems” were continuing to buy “a lot of oil and gas from Russia.”\n \n\n   \n  But Hungary and neighboring Slovakia are the only EU countries still receiving oil from Russia, via the Druzhba pipeline. In the wake of Moscow’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, EU countries moved to phase out Russian oil, but granted an exemption to Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – three countries heavily reliant on Russian imports – to give them time to reduce their reliance.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, Hungary and Slovakia used the exemption to deepen their dependence. Hungary upped its dependence on Russian crude oil from 61% pre-invasion to 86% in 2024. This year, Russia accounted for 92% of Hungary’s crude oil imports. Slovakia, meanwhile, is “almost 100% dependent” on Russian crude oil, according to a  report  from CREA, and the Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD).\n \n\n   \n  The report said phasing out Russian oil is “fully feasible” for Hungary and Slovakia, as the Adria pipeline in Croatia “can meet their combined needs.” Orbán, however, denied this, claiming that the Croatian government would need to enlarge the pipeline to meet Hungary’s needs.\n \n\n   \n  Although EU countries have continued to buy Russian gas, funneled via Turkey through the TurkStream pipeline, Russia’s share of EU gas imports fell from 40% pre-invasion to 11% in 2024. Last month, EU countries agreed to ban all imports of Russian gas from 2028. Hungary and Slovakia opposed the ban.\n \n\n   \n  In an analysis published before Trump’s meeting with Orbán, the Atlantic Council said the White House should be “clear-eyed about the fact that, despite Trump’s chumminess with Orbán, he has been the roadblock to the action the United States is demanding from Europe.”\n \n\n   \n  But, using talking points that have helped win him Trump’s affection in the past, Orbán claimed Hungary, as a “Christian” country that has taken a hard stance against immigration, is a “special island of difference in a liberal ocean in Europe.”\n \n\n   \n  Orbán praised Trump for repairing what he described as damage caused to the US-Hungary relations by the Biden administration, which imposed sanctions on Hungary largely to punish Orbán for democratic backsliding. The Trump administration has since removed some of those sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  “Now we are (in) quite a good position to open up a new chapter – let’s say a golden age – between the United States and Hungary,” Orbán said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/business/online-charitable-contributions-fees-tips","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"What to know about fees and tips when donating to a good cause","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how online charitable donations during the holiday season—especially on Giving Tuesday—can involve fees and optional tips, which may not go to the charity but instead benefit fundraising platforms.

Take Giving Tuesday – which falls on the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving in the United States. Last year it raised an estimated $3.6 billion in the United States. Roughly one-third of that came from online donations –- made either on a third-party online fundraising platform or through nonprofit organizations’ websites, which themselves may be powered by a third-party platform’s fundraising software.\n \n\n   \n  Such platforms have made it fast and easy to contribute to your favorite causes.\n \n\n   \n  With that convenience, though, may come fees and sometimes the option for donors to leave a “tip.”\n \n\n   \n  But who pays the fees? And what is a tip for, exactly?\n \n\n   \n    Fundraising isn’t free\n \n\n   \n  The answers will depend on each individual platform’s business model – and a charity’s decisions about what to ask of its donors when it decides to use a third-party provider.\n \n\n   \n  But one thing is true for all platforms: “They don’t run on air. Providing the service costs money,” said Laurie Styron, executive director of CharityWatch, an independent watchdog.\n \n\n   \n   Processing fees:  These are what platforms are charged by payment processing companies for each transaction. The fee on charitable donations is most typically 2.9% of your donation plus 30 cents.\n \n\n   \n  Some platforms will require the donor to pay the processing fee and will deduct it from your donation amount, while others will ask if you’d like to pay that fee on top of your donation – e.g., you donate $100 plus pay an extra $3.20 for processing – which, like your donation, is tax deductible if you itemize, said Tom O’Saben, director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Professionals. If you opt not to add the processing fee, the nonprofit or the platform will take it out of your donation.\n \n\n   \n   Platform fees:  Besides processing fees, some platforms may charge the nonprofit a fee for use of its services (eg, 3% of donations).\n \n\n   \n  Those services might include providing an easy way for nonprofits to raise funds, conduct online events and access clear records on donations; as well as provide the best encryption to  protect donors’ data .\n \n\n   \n  A big benefit with a percentage-of-donation fee is that “it means the nonprofit isn’t paying for donations they don’t get,” said nonprofit consultant Christina Tzavaras Edwards . \n \n\n   \n  And some platforms will give donors the option to cover both processing  and  platform fees to alleviate the financial burden on the nonprofit.\n \n\n   \n   Optional tips:  Sometimes fundraising platforms will waive their platform (and even processing) fees for nonprofits, and instead ask donors if they’d like to leave an “optional tip” – again, as a percentage of their donation.\n \n\n   \n  In that instance, Edwards said, “You’re tipping the tech company … not the charity.”   \n \n\n   \n  Why? Such tips, which are not tax deductible, are often explained as a way for the platform to continue offering free fundraising services to help hundreds or even thousands of nonprofits.\n \n\n   \n  Kathy Ruiz-Carter, who runs a very small nonprofit organization, said the Givebutter platform provides her organization with a lot of free robust fundraising options, including the ability to hold live events and auctions online, all of which help her organization grow.\n \n\n   \n  “They make it so easy. We don’t have to deal with creating the systems and making sure this connects to this and sending out receipts. Everything is built in. It’s very much plug-and-play,” Ruiz-Carter said.\n \n\n   \n  Some platforms prepopulate the tip field with a suggested percentage. This reporter saw a few with suggested percentages ranging between 15% and 17%. But the donor is offered a tip slider to adjust the percentage up or down – or even to select 0%.\n \n\n   \n  With GoFundMe, for instance, “The majority of donors adjust our tipping slider and, in many cases, do move it to zero,” a company spokesperson said, adding that doing so has “no effect on the amount the beneficiary – whether it’s a nonprofit or an individual – receives.” Should a donor unintentionally tip, the company will  refund  it.\n \n\n   \n  Ideally, though, donor advocates would prefer platforms not prepopulate the tip field. “As a watchdog we deeply dislike that,” Styron said. “People are busy and they’re just trying to do a good thing. … Make it something you have to opt in (to) rather than opt out (of).”\n \n\n   \n    What to consider when donating online\n \n\n   \n  How much you’re willing to pay in fees or tips should depend on:\n \n\n   \n   What you can afford:  If money is tight, only donate what feels comfortable,  and let the nonprofit work out the expenses.\n \n\n   \n   What you want to accomplish:  If your goal is to support a good cause, paying a fee or tip that you can afford is one way to make your chosen nonprofit’s job easier. If you make recurring monthly donations, know that the fee and/or tip may be assessed each time.\n \n\n   \n   What is transparent:  If a third-party platform’s explanation of fees or tips is confusing, contact the nonprofit you want to give to and ask for a better explanation. “Donor trust is incredibly important,” Edwards said.\n \n\n   \n  Or, if possible, try to donate directly on that nonprofit’s site and bypass the middleman, Styron suggested.\n \n\n   \n  (For more general questions about making donations online, CharityWatch offers guidance  here .)\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/health/211-food-assistance-hotline-snap","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"National 211 Hotline Calls for Food Assistance Quadrupled in Days Amid SNAP Benefit Delays","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In late October 2025, calls to the national 211 food assistance hotline surged from nearly 1,000 per day to over 4,200, a fourfold increase triggered by the announcement that SNAP benefits would be delayed by the Trump administration.

Kreuter and Rachel Garg, The Conversation\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Between January and mid-October 2025, calls to local 211 helplines from people seeking food pantries in their community  held steady at nearly 1,000 calls per day .\n \n\n   \n  But as the government shutdown entered its fourth week in late October,  states began to warn residents  that  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  benefits, sometimes known as food stamps, would likely be affected. Nearly  42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits  each month.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next several days,  calls to 211 from people seeking food pantries doubled  to over 2,200 per day. Then on Oct. 26, the Trump administration announced that SNAP benefits  would not be arriving  as scheduled in November. The next day, food pantry calls skyrocketed to 3,324. The following day, calls reached 3,870. By Wednesday, it was 4,214.\n \n\n   \n  We are public health scientists  specializing in health communication  and  unmet social needs . We and our colleagues have been working closely with the  211 network of helplines  across the U.S. for 18 years.\n \n\n   \n  Excluding disasters, sudden surges of this magnitude in requests for food or any other need are rare at 211s, and can signal both public worry and need, as happened in the  first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic .\n \n\n   \n    What is 211?\n \n\n   \n  Like 911 for emergencies,  211 is a national three-digit dialing code , launched in 2000, that connects callers to information specialists at the nearest local 211 helpline. Those specialists listen to callers’ needs and provide them with referrals to health and social service providers near them that may be able to help.\n \n\n   \n  Every call to 211 is classified by the need of the caller, such as shelter, rent, utilities or food – each of which has its own code.\n \n\n   \n  Callers are  disproportionately women , most of whom have children or teens living in their homes. Most don’t make enough money to make ends meet. They call 211 seeking help paying rent or utility bills, getting food to feed their family, or securing household necessities like a winter coat for a child, or a mattress.\n \n\n   \n   READ: Who gets SNAP benefits in 5 charts \n \n\n   \n  The hotline does not solve these problems for callers, but 211 information specialists use the most current local information available to refer callers to service agencies that are most likely to have resources to help.\n \n\n   \n  The 211 network is the closest thing the U.S. has to a real-time surveillance system of the needs of low-income Americans.\n \n\n   \n  There are roughly 200 state and local 211s in the U.S., and on an average day they will  collectively field between 35,000 and 40,000 requests  for help. Each request is coded using a taxonomy of over 10,000 need types, is time- and date-stamped, and is linked to the caller’s ZIP code. In addition to phone calls received by their helplines, 211s increasingly track requests they receive online, through their websites. The national network of 211s covers all 50 states and  99% of the U.S. population .\n \n\n   \n  It’s encouraging to us that with each passing year of giving talks and lectures about 211, more and more audience members raise their hands when asked if they’ve ever heard of 211. But it’s far from 100%. If you are one of those with your hand down, here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    Gaining local insights\n \n\n   \n  Our team aims to deploy the latest methods from data science, predictive analytics and artificial intelligence to detect trends in critical needs sooner and at a more localized level, increasing the speed and efficiency of getting needed help to local community members.\n \n\n   \n  Our research has described the  needs of callers  who reach out to 211,  community capacity to respond to callers’ needs , the ability of 211  to detect rapid changes  in community needs, and the benefits of  integrating health referrals  into 211s.\n \n\n   \n   READ: Nation’s most comprehensive report on food insecurity is scrapped \n \n\n   \n  When we saw food requests rising sharply in late October, we reached out to local leaders at 211 call centers to get insights into what they were hearing from callers.\n \n\n   \n  Robin Pokojski, vice president of 211 and community partnerships at United Way of Greater St. Louis, reported that with all the uncertainty around SNAP benefits, callers were initially “anticipating” a need for food pantries. Tiffany Olson, who directs essential services at Crisis Connections and its 211 call center in Washington state, shared that even callers who rely heavily on their SNAP benefits sometimes  need to use food banks as a supplement .\n \n\n   \n  Those callers know that pivoting to rely  solely on food banks probably won’t be enough  to meet their food needs in full. They realize that food pantries and food banks will be more heavily burdened if SNAP benefits are unavailable.\n \n\n   \n    Increasing the impact of 211 data\n \n\n   \n  The trove of daily data on the needs of U.S. callers to 211 at the ZIP code level is unparalleled. Yet for years it was virtually invisible to anyone who didn’t work at a 211 hotline.\n \n\n   \n  Even for people who work and volunteer within the 211 system, formal reporting on caller needs within a community was minimal, such as a one-page annual summary.\n \n\n   \n  That changed in 2013.\n \n\n   \n  Working with 211s across the country, our team created  211 Counts , a collection of user-friendly, public-facing data dashboards for local 211s across the U.S.\n \n\n   \n   READ: Work requirements are better at blocking benefits for low-income people than they are at helping those folks find jobs \n \n\n   \n  The dashboards allow users to explore the top needs in their community, see which neighborhoods are affected most and understand how needs are changing over time. The data can be sorted by legislative districts, school districts and counties to make the findings more relevant to different audiences.\n \n\n   \n  Data on 211 requests are updated each night. Now in its 12th year, 211 Counts includes data on over 90 million requests from 211 callers in all or parts of 44 states. The local dashboards have been visited millions of times.\n \n\n   \n    211 as an early-warning system\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time data collected through 211 hotlines has detected early signs of trouble for some Americans. Just weeks ago, we found that calls from people seeking assistance making car payments have been increasing steadily for five months, with daily calls peaking in October, at nearly twice the rate of May 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Before that, 211s were months ahead of news reporting in seeing public distress  associated with the 2022 baby formula shortage , the  2016 Flint water crisis  and the  2007 subprime mortgage crisis .\n \n\n   \n  When requests for major needs like food increase three- to fourfold overnight, every local 211 is likely to register this abrupt change.\n \n\n   \n  But when less frequent needs, such as car payment assistance, creep up slowly, with an extra call here and there over several months, it’s unlikely that any local 211 hotline would notice.\n \n\n   \n  That’s when the advantages of big data are greatest. By combining caller needs from 211s across the country, patterns emerge that would otherwise be missed. New data science tools are rapidly improving the speed and accuracy of detecting slight changes. When community and national leaders are made aware of potential rising threats, those threats can be tracked more closely and responses prepared.\n \n\n   \n  It’s easy to lose sight of the fact that each data point is a hungry child or a worried parent.\n \n\n   \n  Hotlines and food banks and food pantries need support in this moment to feed people. But most local safety net systems struggle to meet their community’s needs all the time. Data that documents the magnitude of need won’t fix the scarcity of local assistance, but it can help guide communities in allocating limited resources.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/travel/travel-news-airport-divorce-trend","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Why one man says the ‘airport divorce’ is the best way to start a vacation","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article explores various travel and cultural trends in 2025, including the rise of the 'airport divorce' — a romantic practice where couples split during airport activities and reunite on the flight — popularized by British travel journalist Huw Oliver.

domestic flight and then chilling in the lounge. She prefers to have a pre-flight cocktail and browse the duty free options. What’s a couple to do? Welcome to “ the airport divorce .”\n \n\n   \n  British travel journalist Huw Oliver coined the phrase to explain how he and his fiancee go through airport security together, split up for different airport activities (having a beer, trying out perfumes, obsessively watching the departures screen), and then reunite on board the plane.\n \n\n   \n  Some people might just call this “compromising,” but Oliver says the airport divorce has done wonders for his relationship — and it sets the tone for a happy vacation.\n \n\n   \n    Secret garden\n \n\n   \n  Many travelers love being able to say they’re among the first to go somewhere. Now, visitors to Beijing’s Forbidden City complex can access Qianlong, a secret garden  that has been closed for a century .\n \n\n   \n  Timed for the 100th anniversary of the Palace Museum’s opening, the Chinese attraction features rockeries, symbolic figurines believed to ward off fire and destruction, and a discreet entrance that gives you a sense of what it felt like to be the Emperor sneaking into his personal green space.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has been a surprisingly big year for opening up formerly secret places, both above and under ground.\n \n\n   \n  The Comodus Tunnel, a secret passageway used by Roman emperors to access the Colosseum,  just opened to the public  this fall.\n \n\n   \n  And in London, a mile-long tunnel complex used during World War II is being converted into an underground attraction, which will house a museum, an arts center, and — best of all —  the world’s lowest licensed bar .

\n\n   \n  “It’s a perfect symbol of his presidency,” Biden said. “Trump has taken a wrecking ball not only to the people’s house but to the Constitution, to the rule of law, to our very democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden also mocked Trump’s repeated declarations that his second term has brought  “a golden age”  to the country.\n \n\n   \n  “He now says we are quote ‘in a golden age.’ The only gold is the stuff he’s hanging on the mantle,” the former president said, referring to Trump’s  gilded additions to the Oval Office .\n \n\n   \n  At times during the remarks, Biden addressed Trump directly. In one instance, the former president said to Trump, “You act in a way that embarrasses us as a nation, quite frankly.”   \n \n\n   \n  He also criticized Trump for prioritizing the interests of his wealthy allies over the American people.\n \n\n   \n  “You work for us, Mr. President. We don’t work for you. You work for us, not just billionaires and millionaires,” Biden said, adding, “I’m angry.”\n \n\n   \n  The former president also discussed his  prostate cancer diagnosis , just weeks after ringing the bell to commemorate the completion of a course of radiation therapy. Biden tied his personal experience with the illness to the importance of health care.\n \n\n   \n  “I thank God for the doctors and the nurses and the incredible breakthroughs we’re making in cancer research,” Biden said. “Now Trump and his Republican friends are cutting government funding for health care and making it more expensive, more expensive for virtually everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden’s remarks come as the country is in the longest government shutdown in history, with the stalemate centered around the issue of health care subsidies. Democrats are refusing to support Republicans’ bill to fund the government because it doesn’t extend the  Affordable Care Act enhanced premium subsidies , which are set to expire at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  Biden also weighed in on the Democrats’ sweeping victory in Tuesday’s election, loudly exclaiming, “The Democratic party is back!”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats won across the spectrum Tuesday with  Zohran Mamdani  elected mayor of New York City, while  Abigail Spanberger  and  Mikie Sherrill  won gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively. In California, a Democrat-backed  ballot measure on redistricting  was also approved by voters.\n \n\n   \n  He argued that the wins demonstrate that “the American people are sending a message … to Trump and to his crowd,” denouncing Trump’s policies.\n \n\n   \n  Hitting a familiar note from his campaign last year, Biden went on to stress the fragility of democracy and urged the room of supporters “to put in the work” to defend it.\n \n\n   \n  “Democracy is not a given,” Biden said. “There is nothing guaranteed about democracy even in America. You have to put in the work. We have to elect the leaders who believe in democracy, who stand up for it, who defend it, who protect it.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden later added, “I know this nation. I know the American people. And here’s what I know: No one, no one, not even the president, can destroy our democracy if we stand together and fight for it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/middleeast/israel-receives-remains-hostage-gaza-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"07:29:00-05:00","title":"Israel Identifies Deceased Hostage from Gaza Following Fourth Such Transfer This Week","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has identified and received the remains of Command Sergeant Major Lior Rudaeff, a 61-year-old deputy security coordinator killed during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack, marking the fourth such transfer of deceased hostages from Gaza this week.

November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Typhoon Kalmaegi damaged homes and uprooted trees in central Vietnam this week after cutting a path of destruction through the Philippines, where it killed nearly 200 people.\n \n\n   \n  Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons on record to hit Vietnam, brought torrential rains and destructive winds to an area already saturated by floods due to record rainfall.\n \n\n   \n  The typhoon left a trail of death and devastation as it tore through the central Philippines on Tuesday, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble and displacing tens of thousands of people. At least 188 people were killed, most in Cebu province, a tourist hotspot, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  Kalmaegi strengthened as it barreled toward the coast of Vietnam Thursday, carrying maximum sustained winds of 125 mph, records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showed.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have  long warned  the human-caused climate crisis – for which industrialized nations bear greater historical responsibility – has only exacerbated the scale and intensity of regional storms that disproportionately impact populations in the Global South.\n \n\n   \n  In the Philippines, survivors have begun the mammoth task of salvaging belongings and digging through the thick mud and debris of their destroyed homes, as the receding floodwaters exposed widespread devastation.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile another typhoon, Fung-Wong, known locally as Uwan, is hurtling towards the Philippines’ northern islands, posing a renewed threat of deadly storm surge, flooding and damage.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know:\n \n\n   \n    Homes damaged in Vietnam\n \n\n   \n  Residents began to assess the storm’s damage on Friday, with reports of houses collapsed, roofs b﻿lown off buildings, trees downed, and more than 1 million people left without power, according to state media.\n \n\n   \n  At least five people were killed and seven injured, state media Vietnam News reported, citing local authorities. One person was killed when a house collapsed during the storm in central Vietnam, and three people remain missing after being swept out to sea on Ly Son, an island in Vietnam’s Quang Ngai province, according to state media.\n \n\n   \n  Heavy rains unleashed by Kalmaegi also flooded coastal communities in Dak Lak province, which recorded 354 mm (1 foot) of rain in about six hours, Vietnam News reported.\n \n\n   \n  More than 500,000 people were evacuated, many by boat, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  The typhoon hit as the country struggles to recover from devastating flooding last week that submerged historical sites including the ancient town of Hoi An and former imperial capital Hue.\n \n\n   \n  During those floods, more than a dozen people were killed and over 116,000 houses and 5,000 hectares of crops flooded, Reuters reported, citing the government’s disaster agency.\n \n\n   \n  Kalmaegi weakened into a tropical depression on Friday as it moved farther inland from central Vietnam, toward northern Cambodia and Laos, according to the Vietnam National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Strong, damaging winds remain a threat and continued heavy rains could trigger further flash floods and landslides in central Vietnam over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n    Homes turned to rubble\n \n\n   \n  The scale of the disaster in the Philippines’ hardest-hit Cebu province and surrounding areas took residents and local officials by surprise.\n \n\n   \n  Drone footage showed catastrophic flooding that turned streets into rivers, submerged homes and overturned cars as Typhoon Kalmaegi, known locally as Tino, dumped more than a month’s worth of rain in only 24 hours in some areas.\n \n\n   \n  In Talisay city, rows of homes were flattened and impoverished communities along the Mananga River were buried in mud and debris. In Cebu city, rescue workers could be seen wading through waist-deep water to free trapped residents from roofs and submerged homes.\n \n\n   \n  Kalmaegi is the deadliest typhoon to hit the region this year.

      5:19 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Pope Leo XIV, who on Saturday marked six months since his election, has in recent weeks stepped up his criticism of the Trump administration while bringing a distinctively American flavor to the papacy.\n \n\n   \n  The Chicago-born pontiff was elected on May 8, becoming the first US-born pope in the Catholic Church’s history. After a cautious start,  Leo  has now begun to find his voice and on Tuesday called for a “deep reflection” on what has been happening to  immigrants  in the United States over recent months under President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people who have lived for years, and years and years, never causing problems, have been deeply affected by what’s going on right now,” he told reporters outside the papal retreat of Castel Gandolfo.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking in English, and thereby ensuring he could reach his intended audience directly, the pope pointed out that Christian teaching spells out that believers will be judged on how they treated “the foreigner.” He also appealed to authorities to respect the “spiritual rights” of those detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in his home state of Illinois. His remarks come after  reports  that priests and pastoral workers have been unable to bring communion to those detained.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time Leo has spoken on this topic. He has lamented the  “inhuman” treatment of migrants in the US  while urging bishops in his home country to speak out. He’s also expressed concern about tensions between the US and Canada, and the US and Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  While the pope has a more reserved, formal style than his predecessor, he is continuing Francis’ priorities. At one level, Leo represents continuity with Francis – the first Latin American pontiff – given he spent decades in Peru as a missionary. He retains a close connection with the people of Peru and remains a citizen of the country.\n \n\n   \n  “His front-burner issues seem to be poverty, migration, climate change, and he’s a big champion of the project of synodality started by Francis – the effort to make the Catholic Church more inclusive and participatory,” Christopher White, author of “Pope Leo XIV: Inside the Conclave and the Dawn of a New Papacy” and a senior fellow at Georgetown University in Washington DC, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  White insists that Leo “isn’t looking for a fight – with Trump or anyone,” but said he has “moral red lines” and is “particularly upset” about the treatment of migrants.\n \n\n   \n  Following Leo’s remarks on Tuesday, a spokesman for the White House told Reuters that Trump was elected based on commitments to deporting “criminal illegal aliens” and that “he is keeping his promise to the American people.” The US Department for Homeland Security said those detained by ICE were held in humane conditions.\n \n\n   \n  A US-born pope who is a keen sports fan and native English speaker is something of a novelty for the Vatican. Leo is a  big supporter of the Chicago White Sox  and on October 15, days after the rival Chicago Cubs were eliminated from the playoffs, the pope was out greeting crowds in St. Peter’s Square. “Go Cubs!” someone shouted out. “They lost!” Leo shouted back, smiling, from the popemobile. Since his election, he’s been presented with a White Sox cap and baseball and NFL jerseys.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from sports paraphernalia, he’s also been presented with other reminders from home: on one occasion while out in the popemobile he was hand-delivered a  box of Chicago pizza from Aurelio’s , with  Leo a regular visitor  to one of their restaurants in Homewood, Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  “He has offered a forceful and direct counterweight to the Trump administration’s ‘inhuman treatment of immigrants’,” Kim Daniels, the director of The Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at also at Georgetown told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She said while Leo is “not retreating” from speaking out on what is happening in the US he’s not making it “personal or political”. Daniels says Leo speaks “as a moral and spiritual leader, and as someone with roots in both Chicago and Chiclayo (Peru).”\n \n\n   \n  Massimo Faggioli, a church historian at Trinity College, Dublin, who was previously based at Villanova University, Pennsylvania, said the pope’s interventions on immigration in recent weeks were significant for US Catholic leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “He has stepped up in directly addressing the issues,” he told CNN. “It’s also part of the message of the US bishops, so they will feel encouraged by what is coming from the pope.”\n \n\n   \n  Bishops from the US will meet November 10-13 in Baltimore, where they are due to elect a new president and vice-president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. In the coming months, Leo is expected to appoint a new Archbishop of New York to succeed Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who has reached the retirement age of 75. The pope has called for the US bishops to have a  “stronger, more united voice”  on issues such as immigration and said that “the church cannot remain silent.”\n \n\n   \n  Leaders such as Cardinal Robert McElroy of Washington DC and Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago have been  speaking out strongly on migration , but the forthcoming elections and the pope’s appointments to the US church hierarchy will be crucial. During the Francis era, some bishops were resistant to his agenda and priorities, and some conservative Catholics had hoped Leo would represent a break with his predecessor.\n \n\n   \n  But Faggioli insists that after the first six months, anyone who believed Leo would be an “an anti-Francis or post-Francis pope” is “fooling themselves.” Like Francis, Leo has faced criticism from conservative  US Catholics and MAGA supporters , angered by his comments on migration and climate change.\n \n\n   \n  Leo has a full plate and plenty of big decisions to make. He’s been keeping up an intense schedule of meetings and public events as the Catholic Church continues to celebrate a Jubilee year – which takes place every quarter of a century – with an increased number of pilgrims coming to the Vatican.\n \n\n   \n  Later this month, he embarks on his first foreign visit as pope – travelling to Turkey and Lebanon from 27 November to 2 December – during which he’s expected to emphasize peace in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  When he emerged on the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica in early May, Leo seemed almost overcome with emotion. But after spending these first months acclimatizing to his new role, the first American pope is slowly getting into his stride.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/06/us/ups-plane-crash-victims-louisville","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"10:45:00.000-05:00","title":"3 employees of Louisville facility among those missing after UPS plane crash that looked like ‘hell’s fury,’ owner says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS cargo plane crashed into the Grade A Auto Parts recycling and auto-part facility in Louisville, Kentucky, shortly after takeoff, causing a massive fireball explosion described as resembling 'hell’s fury.'

after UPS plane crash that looked like ‘hell’s fury,’ owner says \n       \n  By Isabel Rosales, Dalia Faheid, Jason Morris, Taylor Galgano, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:45 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The power had just gone off and the ground was shaking at Grade A Auto Parts when the owner received a panicked video call from his chief financial officer.\n \n\n   \n  On his screen, CEO Sean Garber watched a “huge fireball” engulf the Louisville, Kentucky, auto-part and recycling facility he has owned for decades as his colleague described a blast followed by “a continuation of explosions.”\n \n\n   \n  “It looked like really hell’s fury around her,” Garber recalled, describing seeing his employees screaming and running from the flames.\n \n\n   \n  A UPS cargo plane had just  slammed into the facility  shortly after taking off from a nearby airport Tuesday, leaving at least  14 people dead  and multiple families with missing loved ones, Kentucky officials said. Three of Garber’s employees are among those still unaccounted for.\n \n\n   \n  Three crew members aboard the freight plane are believed to be among those found dead, Kentucky officials said. UPS identified them Thursday as Captain Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Captain Dana Diamond.\n \n\n   \n  As flames raged and doors melted shut at the recycling facility, people jumped from windows and ran, some employees helping shield others from the growing inferno, the owner said.\n \n\n   \n  The collision left behind a fiery trail of destruction and  a half-mile-long debris field , devastating multiple small businesses like Grade A Auto Parts, where mangled, blackened remnants of buildings were set in the background of an “apocalyptic” ashy sky with an acrid smell in the air, Kentucky officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials are now losing hope there could be more survivors as bodies are pulled from the vast wreckage and the death toll grows.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not expect to find anyone else alive in the area,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said at a news conference Wednesday, adding the coroner’s office is working to identify remains found at the crash site, but the conditions of some victims’ bodies may make their task more difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Now, some Louisville residents are mourning those killed as others are enduring an agonizing wait to hear from missing loved ones, including the workers’ families and two men who said they  have not heard from  a woman believed to have been at Grade A Auto Parts when the crash happened.\n \n\n   \n    ‘She’s all I got’\n \n\n   \n  A woman had been dropping off some scrap metal at Grade A Auto Parts after work when the freight plane crashed, her boyfriend, Donald Henderson, told CNN affiliate  WDRB  Tuesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “‘I don’t want to go, (you) go ahead,’” Henderson recalled telling her.\n \n\n   \n  Video of the scene shows a mountainous plume of charcoal-colored smoke emanating from buildings that were set ablaze. In another chilling video at the facility, a man yells, “Did everybody make it out?” When another person responds, “No,” he screams, “What do you mean no?”\n \n\n   \n  Henderson went to a family assistance center authorities set up at the Louisville police training academy with William Moreland, who shares two children with the missing woman. Both struggled to put how they’re feeling into words.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s all I got, so … I don’t know how this is going to turn out,” Henderson told WDRB.\n \n\n   \n  The two men said officials at the center took their information and promised to “give us the news as it comes in.”\n \n\n   \n  “I had to go – I can’t be in there,” Henderson   said about being in the center with other emotional families desperately awaiting word on the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n \n\n   \n  Grade A Auto Parts – one of  two small businesses  the governor says were directly impacted by the plane – is now trying to access its computer system to help officials identify customers who were at the facility when the crash happened, according to Garber. It’s unclear exactly how many customers were at the facility at the time, but Garber says there are typically between 15 to 30 customers around that time.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s been bodies found. Many of them are not recognizable, and they’re trying to figure that out,” Garber said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘He was a great guy’\n \n\n   \n  John Loucks, a 52-year-old beloved uncle who worked on and off at Grade A Auto Parts for at least a decade, is one of the missing victims, according to his nephew Justin Loucks.\n \n\n   \n  The Louisville Metro Police Department told their family that John Loucks’ body has not been located and that they are conducting DNA testing of the remains. The lack of answers, Justin Loucks said, is difficult.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s scary really,” Loucks told CNN. “Did he die on impact? Did he land in the woods somewhere?”\n \n\n   \n  “We were told (DNA testing) could take weeks or even longer,” he added. “(Police) said there’s a lot of remains still getting recovered and a lot of them are unrecognizable.”\n \n\n   \n  Loucks said he was very close to his uncle growing up, but that they had a disagreement about a year and a half ago. “Officially, he’s still just missing … but it sucks knowing I’m not able to reconcile with him. That’s the hardest part about all this,” Loucks said.\n \n\n   \n  The pair spent a lot of time together playing video games and watching sports, he added.\n \n\n   \n  John Loucks, who lived around Louisville his entire life, loved the Kentucky Wildcats basketball team and fishing, his nephew said. But most importantly, his nephew added, Loucks loved working as a heavy machinery operator.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s what he loved doing. He loved waking up and going to work everyday,” Justin Loucks said. “He was a great guy.”\n \n\n   \n  As the holidays approach, Justin Loucks remembers spending most of them with his uncle and says he will be thinking of him during the upcoming season.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s always hope, but given the governor’s statement … I don’t feel there’s as much chance (he’s still alive), but hey, God works in mysterious ways,” the nephew said. “You never know.”\n \n\n   \n    Headcount revealed missing employees\n \n\n   \n  After the plane collapsed into Garber’s business – apparently coming to rest in the heart of the facility – a headcount revealed three employees were unaccounted for, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Two of the missing employees had been in a building where people jumped from windows to escape the flames after the heat melted the doors shut, Garber said. The third person was believed to be in a warehouse next door.\n \n\n   \n  The incoming plane looked like a rapidly approaching fireball to one of the managers, who tackled a colleague to the floor before they found themselves standing in a burning room, Garber said he later learned.\n \n\n   \n  “There were just so many heroes helping each other out,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  An employee dove between two metal bales that surround the facility to quickly carry a customer who had been burned to safety.\n \n\n   \n  “I would have to imagine it is what a war zone looks like,” Garber said.\n \n\n   \n  As he surveyed the damage Wednesday, Garber said he had lost hope that his employees were still alive. “It’s not survivable,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  One of the missing employees had been with the business for about two decades, Garber said. The second had been working there for about five years and the third had been employed there for about four years.\n \n\n   \n  When Garber met with their families at a family assistance center early Wednesday morning, he noticed they were in a state of shock, made worse by the uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  “There still isn’t resolution for them,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Garber feels both anger and sorrow thinking about the employees and customers whose loved ones are still searching for.\n \n\n   \n  “We make our money by providing a service to our customers. People came in just to do that,” Garber said. “They didn’t get to go home and that’s a problem and that’s heartbreaking.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/shutdown-airport-delays-food-stamps","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"People are really hurting: From airports to grocery stores, shutdown leaves Americans scrambling","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting from October to November 2025, has severely disrupted daily life across the country.

airports to grocery stores, shutdown leaves Americans scrambling \n       \n  By Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The impacts of the longest federal  government shutdown  in United States history are reverberating around the country — leaving millions of Americans in limbo and igniting concerns about an economic downturn.\n \n\n   \n  Frustrated travelers were scrambling as more than a thousand  flights were canceled  Friday and thousands more were delayed. Those who count on food stamps were in limbo as President Donald Trump’s administration continued  fighting in federal court  to resist paying full benefits for November. Federal workers who  haven’t been paid  in weeks said their bills were due and they were running out of options.\n \n\n   \n  With Congress in a stalemate — majority Republicans still short of the 60 votes they need to pass a government funding measure in the Senate, and minority Democrats sticking to their health insurance funding demands — no end to the shutdown is in sight.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican,  told reporters  Friday that the “wheels came off” in compromise talks with Democrats. He told senators to remain in Washington and available for votes this weekend. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would agree to end the shutdown in exchange for one more year of enhanced  Affordable Care Act subsidies  — an attempt to further pressure the GOP to make a deal.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty over when the shutdown might end has led to deepening concerns about damage it could do to the overall economy — with one of Trump’s top economic officials sounding the alarm on Friday. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Fox Business that the economic impact of the shutdown is “far worse” than initially expected “because it’s gone on for so long.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we go another month or so, then who knows how bad the economy could be this quarter,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Frustrated travelers see flights canceled, delayed\n \n\n   \n  A 4% reduction in domestic flights ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration took effect Friday, leading to more than a thousand canceled flights across 40 major airports — with further cuts slated for the weekend due to air traffic controller staffing issues.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the cancellations, major airports — including those in Washington, Atlanta, San Francisco and Newark — were experiencing major delays due to short-staffed control towers.\n \n\n   \n  Travelers across the country told CNN they feared their plans being upended.\n \n\n   \n  Alicia Leva was set to get married Saturday in South Florida. But with more than half of her guests attending from across the country, Leva said she saw travel plans unraveling fast.\n \n\n   \n  “When I found out about the flight delays, I was just incredibly anxious,” she said. Leva didn’t want to compare her wedding woes to others who have been deeply affected by the government shutdown, but was still mourning her original vision of the couple’s special day.\n \n\n   \n  Traveler Jay Curley had hoped to fly to Wilmington, North Carolina, from Newark International Airport on Thursday night, but was instead going to rent a car, he told CNN in frustration Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “People are really hurting out here,” he said. Addressing federal lawmakers, he added: “It’s not just the traveling public, but it’s affecting the whole economy, and you people are to blame.”\n \n\n   \n  When Luana Griffin’s mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer this past week, she booked a flight to go spend a few days with her. Griffin’s trip, from San Diego to Sacramento, is planned for next week, she told CNN. Griffin said she has limited windows of time to be able to see her mom because she is working a contract job. Any delay or cancellation of her return flight could cause her to miss work the next day, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I have very limited time left with my mom and so many other decisions, this is the last thing I need,” she told CNN in an email.\n \n\n   \n    ‘From bad to worse’\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge on Thursday  ruled  that the Trump administration needed to fully pay Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for more than 40 million Americans this month, rather than the partial payments the administration had proposed.\n \n\n   \n  “The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened and needless suffering will occur. That’s what irreparable harm here means. Last weekend, SNAP benefits lapsed for the first time in our nation’s history. This is a problem that could have and should have been avoided,” US District Judge John McConnell said during Thursday’s hearing in Rhode Island.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture then announced Friday it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal court order, and that the process should be completed later in the day. Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  But later Friday, the Supreme Court  temporarily paused  the lower court order requiring full payment of benefits, injecting more uncertainty into whether food stamp recipients would see their full allotments anytime soon.\n \n\n   \n  Zacherie Martin, 35, of Bremerton, Washington, said he and his girlfriend are out of work and rely on food stamps in part because they can never predict whether local food banks will have food available.\n \n\n   \n  He said he’s been following news about the government shutdown “very closely,” and is struggling to plan, given the uncertainty around whether and what amount of SNAP benefits he’ll receive.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m worried if I’m going to even be able to eat at all before Thanksgiving — or at all tomorrow night, or tonight, even,” Martin said.\n \n\n   \n  Laura Bowles, a pregnant mother of five children, ages 4 to 13, in West Virginia, is trying to make her husband’s paycheck from Walmart stretch to feed their family and pay the bills this month. She  told CNN  earlier this week that her growing family has already made some tough choices this month after their SNAP benefits didn’t replenish on the first.\n \n\n   \n  “My kids eat a lot. And groceries are already so expensive these days. It was already hard,” Bowles said. “It’s a struggle out here. I am pregnant again, and that wasn’t part of the plan — but it was God’s plan. I guess people struggle everywhere, but it’s hard here in West Virginia. It just feels extra hard here. And this just made things go from bad to worse. Way worse.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuts or delays in SNAP benefits could also hurt the stores that sell to its recipients — particularly smaller grocers.\n \n\n   \n  SNAP accounted for $124 billion in sales at 262,000 retailers in 2023 — half of which were at superstores such as Walmart. A quarter of sales went to supermarkets.\n \n\n   \n  Large chains such as Walmart, Kroger, and Dollar General can absorb cuts to SNAP. It’s the small, independent grocers that depend on SNAP for up to half of their sales to sustain razor-thin profit margins that are most vulnerable to cuts, economists and grocers say.\n \n\n   \n  Progressive think tank Center for American Progress in May identified 27,000 retailers — mostly in rural areas with large shares of SNAP recipients — likeliest to shoulder the brunt of cuts to SNAP. In dozens of small counties and tribal areas, more than 30% or 40% of the population receives SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n    Federal workers under mounting pressure\n \n\n   \n  Though many of them have remained on the job, most federal workers haven’t been paid during the shutdown. Some of them told CNN that bills are now piling up.\n \n\n   \n  Lisa Morales, a nurse who works at a military base in El Paso, Texas, said she was able to make rent for October and November, but can’t go any further without pay. She said she’s not sure how she’s going to afford her car and insurance payments, gas, groceries, dog food and utilities this month without a paycheck. She said her landlord won’t work with her, and she doesn’t know where she’ll live if the shutdown doesn’t end soon.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not eligible for unemployment, because we are still reporting to work, so that disqualifies us for benefits,” she said. “I will have to look for another job this month if the government continues to be shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  At a recent job fair in McLean, Virginia, hosted by RockITGov, furloughed federal workers offered sobering accounts of what they face. They asked not to be named in order to speak candidly.\n \n\n   \n  “I haven’t gotten a paycheck. I’m trying to find a way to support my family. I have a young family,” one federal worker said. “We’re trying to figure out next steps, what our finances look like.”\n \n\n   \n  A nine-year Pentagon employee who took the deferred resignation offer in May said she was supposed to be paid through December, but hasn’t received a paycheck since early October because of the shutdown. She said she’s planning to skip holiday travel and gift-giving.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m concerned about my car payments. I’ll probably call the bank and see if I can skip a car payment,” she said. “I may have to take money from my retirement if my savings run out.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/americas/iran-assassination-plot-israeli-ambassador-mexico-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"19:47:00-05:00","title":"Elite Iranian unit plotted assassination of Israeli ambassador to Mexico, US official says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An elite Iranian military unit, the Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), allegedly plotted the assassination of Israeli ambassador Einat Kranz Neiger in Mexico from late 2024 through early 2025.

of a Miss Universe contestant being berated by a male pageant director in Thailand has sparked widespread allegations of misogyny as well as global discussions about women empowerment and merits of the international beauty pageant.\n \n\n   \n  Nawat Itsaragrisil, president of Miss Grand International (MGI), was seen scolding Fatima Bosch, a 25-year-old contestant from Mexico, ahead of the 74th Miss Universe competition being held in Bangkok later this month.\n \n\n   \n  In a live streamed pre-pageant meeting with dozens of other contestants, Nawat was shown accusing Bosch of not posting enough promotional content about the host country Thailand.\n \n\n   \n  He suggested that Mexico’s pageant director had ordered her to sabotage those promotional activities, and appeared to say that if Bosch listened to those instructions, she was being a “dumbhead.” The Thai pageant director has denied saying this, insisting that he had actually accused her of causing “damage.”\n \n\n   \n  When Bosch pushed back against the insults, Nawat tried to silence her, saying, “I didn’t give you (the) opportunity to talk.” He then called security to escort her out of the room. At that point, other contestants stood up and walked out in solidarity – prompting the pageant’s director to threaten them with elimination if they didn’t sit down.\n \n\n   \n  Though Nawat later apologized publicly to the contestants, his actions drew swift condemnation around the world, including from Mexico’s president, who described it as an “aggression” that Bosch handled with “dignity.”\n \n\n   \n     Anger and apology \n \n\n   \n  Bosch, who was crowned Miss Universe Mexico earlier this year, denounced Nawat for insulting her.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the exchange, she told the media that the mistreatment by the Thai official stemmed from a disagreement Nawat had with the Miss Universe Organization, whose president is also Mexican.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s not fair because I’m here, and I do everything OK. I don’t mess with anyone. I just try to be kind. I’m trying to give my best,” the young woman said in a  video  posted on TikTok.\n \n\n   \n  “He just said to me, ‘shut up,’ and a lot of different things. And I think that the world needs to see this because we are empowered women, and this is a platform for our voice, and no one can shut our voice,” Bosch said.\n \n\n   \n  The president of the Miss Universe Organization, Raúl Rocha, also  criticized  the Thai businessman and restricted him from participating in further activities. Rocha said Nawat had humiliated and disrespected the Mexican contestant, and held him responsible for “the great abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenseless woman trying to silence and exclude her.”\n \n\n   \n  “I have restricted Nawat’s participation in the events that are part of the 74th Miss Universe competition, limiting it as much as possible or eliminating it entirely,” Rocha said in Spanish.\n \n\n   \n  Nawat  apologized  during a live streamed welcoming ceremony on Wednesday. He insisted that he didn’t intend to hurt anyone and that he respected all those involved. “I have to say I’m very sorry,” he told the dozens of participants who stood onstage beside him, including Bosch.\n \n\n   \n     ‘Women look more beautiful when we raise our voices’ \n \n\n   \n  News of the incident quickly reached as high as the Mexican presidency.\n \n\n   \n  During a press conference on Wednesday, President Claudia Sheinbaum said Bosch’s response was “an example of how women must raise their voices.”\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum, who recently experienced an apparent  groping incident , reflected on a sexist phrase often used to silence women in Mexico: “Calladita te ves más bonita,” which means, “You look more beautiful when you’re silent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Well, I don’t know if anyone has said it to the women here, but they did say it to me,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  She proposed a more empowering mantra: “Women look more beautiful when we raise our voices and participate. Because that has to do with the recognition of our rights. So, I recognize this young woman.”\n \n\n   \n     Crown and dignity \n \n\n   \n  Catalina Ruiz Navarro, a Colombian feminist activist and journalist based in Mexico City, argued that the nature of beauty pageants like Miss Universe places women in a patriarchal position.\n \n\n   \n  “The Miss Universe pageant is about disciplining and monitoring the body, and seeing how, through technology, intervention, exercise and diet, we adjust this body to conform to an ideal that is practically Catholic,” she said to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Ruiz Navarro also praised Bosch, saying her reaction was “truly courageous because she had so much to lose. And the fact that the girls left with her at the same time speaks to a collective outrage and marks a small line they were willing to cross.”\n \n\n   \n  Sheynnis Palacios, Miss Universe 2023 and representative of Nicaragua, said on social media that “a crown should not cost a woman her dignity,” She argued that these pageants are supposed to empower, inspire and foster leadership, but that its purpose is betrayed “when power dynamics, humiliation or disrespect are generated.”\n \n\n   \n  Alicia Machado, who was crowned Miss Universe 1996 representing Venezuela, said similar problems existed when she won the pageant. “I don’t understand why these international competitions continue to be condoned for engaging in unethical practices,” she said, calling for the pageant to be used to fight “for gender rights and equality in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Ruiz Navarro says Bosch’s actions and those of the other contestants could limit this type of behavior, but that it may not be enough. As long as beauty pageants exist, she says, “they have to be more inclusive, fairer, and they have to treat beauty queens with dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  The pageant activities began on Sunday in Bangkok. Women from 130 countries are participating in this year’s edition, which concludes on November 21 with the crowning of the winner.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/emergency-appeal-snap-benefits-november","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"10:27:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump administration starts funding full SNAP benefits for November","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would fully fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for November to comply with a federal court order issued by District Judge John McConnell, who ruled that partial benefits were insufficient and that the administration had acted arbitrarily.

Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:27 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture announced Friday it is working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal court order, and the process should be completed later in the day.\n \n\n   \n  Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA’s guidance, posted on the  agency’s website , is the latest step in a weekslong saga that has threatened vital food assistance for nearly 42 million Americans amid the federal government shutdown. A federal judge on Thursday directed the agency to provide  full benefits , which the Trump administration quickly appealed.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA told states last month that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as food stamps are formally known, had run out of money so  November’s benefits could not be distributed . The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling that the agency must at least tap into emergency funds to provide partial benefits for this month or, at its discretion, use other revenue to fully fund November’s allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The agency opted to  fund partial benefits , but warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. That led the plaintiffs in one case to argue that the judge should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet known what the administration’s compliance will mean for the legal challenge pending before US District Judge John McConnell, who ordered the administration on Thursday to make full SNAP payments by the end of Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Friday, the administration asked a Boston-based appeals court to halt McConnell’s order, but the appeals court had not issued a decision by the time the administration said publicly that it was complying with his directive.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps, with payments distributed on a staggered schedule throughout the month. Households receive about $350 a month, on average.\n \n\n   \n    Full benefits start to flow\n \n\n   \n  Just when food stamp beneficiaries will receive their assistance depends on where they live. Some states are expected to issue benefits immediately, while others may require a little more time.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania residents who should have already received their SNAP benefits this month will start seeing their full allotments hit their electronic benefit transfer cards on Friday, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced at a press conference. State officials worked quickly after McConnell’s ruling to issue benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “We are hoping that by this evening, by midnight or so, that all of those individuals who were owed money over the first week or so of this month, who hadn’t gotten it from the federal administration, are going to get their money,” Shapiro said.\n \n\n   \n  West Virginia also notified SNAP recipients on Friday afternoon that the state is sending full payments for November due to the court order.\n \n\n   \n  New Yorkers can expect to receive their SNAP benefits starting Sunday, according to a statement from Gov. Kathy Hochul. And Massachusetts residents will start receiving their delayed benefits as early as Saturday, Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, North Carolina started distributing partial benefits to more than 586,000 households on Friday morning in line with the USDA’s guidance earlier this week on providing partial benefits. Recipients could see their remaining allotments hit their cards possibly as soon as this weekend, the state Department of Health and Human Services said in a press release.\n \n\n   \n  “We will keep working to help folks put food on the table during this challenging time,” Gov. Josh Stein said.\n \n\n   \n  Food stamp benefits total about $8.2 billion in November, with other expenses pushing the monthly cost up to nearly $9 billion.\n \n\n   \n  The two federal judges said last week that the USDA was required to tap into the program’s roughly $5.3 billion contingency fund, while McConnell ordered the agency on Thursday to also transfer additional unused tariff revenue used to support child nutrition programs in order to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  In its guidance, the agency did not specify how it was funding November’s allotments.\n \n\n   \n    Billions ‘in the metaphorical couch cushions’\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what Friday’s announcement from the USDA will mean for the fast-moving legal fracas around the food benefits program. As of Friday afternoon, neither side in the Rhode Island case had notified either court of the development.\n \n\n   \n  Just after McConnell made his decision on Thursday, the administration appealed it to the First Circuit. By Friday morning, lawyers for the administration were pressing the court, which is stacked with appointees of Democratic presidents, to quickly put the directive on hold.\n \n\n   \n  They argued that McConnell overstepped his authority when he issued his order, which they said “has thrust the Judiciary into the ongoing shutdown negotiations and may well have the effect of extending the lapse in appropriations, exacerbating the problem that the court was misguidedly trying to mitigate.”\n \n\n   \n  “This unprecedented injunction makes a mockery of the separation of powers. Courts hold neither the power to appropriate nor the power to spend,” they wrote. “There is no lawful basis for an order that directs USDA to somehow find $4 billion in the metaphorical couch cushions.”\n \n\n   \n  McConnell’s new order came after he said the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\n \n\n   \n  The coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses that brought the legal challenge late last month urged the First Circuit to swiftly reject the administration’s emergency bid. In court papers filed Friday afternoon, their attorneys emphasized the on-the-ground impact of any potential intervention by the court, noting it’s been nearly a week since recipients began missing payments for November.\n \n\n   \n  “Time is of the essence,” they wrote. “Plaintiffs and the public will be severely and irreparably harmed if defendants are granted a stay, even a brief one.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/us/whitestown-indiana-house-cleaner-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"19:50:00Z","title":"House cleaner shot to death on front porch after going to wrong house in Indianapolis suburb","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Whitestown, an Indianapolis suburb, 32-year-old house cleaner Maria Florinda Rios Perez was fatally shot on the front porch of a home after mistakenly going to the wrong address.

      \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:50 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   (AP) –  Authorities are considering whether to charge an Indiana homeowner who they say shot and killed a woman working as a house cleaner after she mistakenly went to the wrong address.\n \n\n   \n  Police officers found 32-year-old Maria Florinda Rios Perez dead just before 7 a.m. Wednesday on the front porch of the home in Whitestown, an Indianapolis suburb of about 10,000 people, according to a police news release. She was part of a cleaning crew that had gone to the wrong address, the release said.\n \n\n   \n  Rios Perez’s husband, Mauricio Velazquez, told WRTV in Indianapolis that he and his wife had been cleaning homes for seven months. Velazquez said he was standing with her at the home’s front door on Wednesday morning but didn’t realize she had been shot until she fell into his arms, bleeding.\n \n\n   \n  On a fundraising page, her brother described Rios Perez as a mother of four children. Police said Friday that she was from Indianapolis but the family plans to bury her in Guatemala, according to her obituary and her brother’s fundraising page. The Associated Press was not able to reach family members directly on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have not publicly identified the shooter. Police turned over the findings from their investigation to Boone County Prosecutor Kent Eastwood on Friday afternoon, but the prosecutor said the decision on whether to file charges won’t be easy.\n \n\n   \n  The case brings Indiana’s castle doctrine laws squarely into play, he said. Those laws allow a person to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to stop what they reasonably believe is an unlawful entry into their dwelling. Thirty-one states have similar laws on the books, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n \n\n   \n  In similar cases elsewhere, prosecutors have successfully brought charges against people who opened fire outside their homes, including a guilty plea by an 86-year-old  man who shot Ralph Yarl  after the Black teenager came to his door by mistake. In New York, a man was convicted of second-degree murder for fatally  shooting a woman inside a car  who came down his driveway by mistake.\n \n\n   \n  Eastwood said he will have to pore over investigators’ findings to understand what happened in the moments leading up to the shooting. That means reviewing “every second” of witnesses’ taped interviews and doorbell footage if police bring him any, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “You need to understand all the details so you can understand what happened and what is reasonable,” Eastwood said. “One of the hardest things today in this world is to agree on what’s reasonable. As a prosecutor, those are things we have to grapple with.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5601819","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"In an encrypted group chat, National Guard members question Trump deployments","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As President Donald Trump expands National Guard deployments across U.S. cities — including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Portland, and Memphis — a group of Ohio National Guard members have formed an encrypted chat on Signal to voice deep ethical and moral concerns.

an encrypted group chat, National Guard members question Trump deployments \n         By Kat Lonsdorf \n        \n           Monday, November 10, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         As President Trump calls for  National Guard deployments  across the U.S., a small contingent of Ohio guard members has been quietly expressing concern in an encrypted group chat. The administration started sending troops into several Democratic-led cities this summer, citing the need to crack down on violent crime and protect federal immigration facilities. The Ohio guard members now say they're alarmed at the turn the country is taking. They're even questioning their potential role in it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I really went to a dark place when they sent the troops to [Los Angeles], and then eventually [Washington, D.C.], and now, Chicago. This is just not what any of us signed up for, and it's so out of the scope of normal operations,\" says J, a member of the Ohio National Guard who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity. In the summer,  Trump sent troops  into Los Angeles as anti-ICE protests escalated. He then deployed guard troops into D.C., where around 2,300 still regularly patrol streets. Then a torrent of plans for deployments came —  Chicago ,  Portland ,  Memphis , cities in Louisiana and Missouri. Many of them remain embroiled in legal limbo. In Ohio, J and several other members have taken to that group chat to discuss the deployments and the accompanying anxiety they've felt. J, as well as members C and A — all part of the same unit — agreed to talk to NPR on the condition that they are only identified by their first initials, because they are not authorized to talk to the press and fear retribution for expressing their opinions. \"I have been on two humanitarian-esque missions with the guard, which were awesome, doing the things you see on the commercial, helping these communities,\" says J. \"And then you want me to go pick up trash and dissuade homeless people in D.C. at gunpoint. Like, no dude. It's so disheartening every time I see another city — and I just wonder, 'who's going to stand up to this?'\" It's a sentiment that's building with guard members elsewhere. In recent weeks, more than 100 active military members have reached out to  About Face , a nonpartisan nonprofit made up of current service members and post-9/11 veterans to be a resource for those who might be questioning their deployments, according to the organization. \"In the military culture, it's really easy to feel like if you have questions or dissent, you're the only person who thinks that,\" says director Brittany Ramos DeBarros, a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The group has started an information campaign, specifically targeting members of the National Guard around the country — using flyers, posters, even billboards — encouraging them to reach out if they're having doubts. \"We take very seriously making sure that people do understand what they could be facing if they follow their conscience,\" says DeBarros. \"But the thing we also help people think through is, what is the cost of not following your conscience? Because as Iraq and Afghanistan vets in particular, many of us are living with that cost every day.\" NPR reached out to both the White House and the Pentagon for this story. \"Our great National Guardsmen signed up to defend the nation and serve the American people,\" wrote Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson in a statement. \"We are proud of the work they have accomplished this year, and we are confident in their collective ability to carry out any and all orders by President Trump, the Department of War, and state leaders.\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the deployments, saying Trump was using his \"lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel.\" Jackson lashed out at Democratic leaders, saying they'd failed to stop violent attacks on law enforcement. The group chat The group chat with the Ohio National Guard members — set up on the encrypted messaging app Signal — began amid the  flurry of executive orders  President Trump signed as he took office. Some of them affected the military. The members say they needed a space to process it. \"It's not even necessarily expressing opinions or anything. It's just expressing questions about things that come out,\" says A. They say the chat is active every day, with members sharing information and news articles they come across. In recent months, that chat has grown to a dozen members of their unit, and it's become largely focused on Trump's rhetoric around the National Guard and his deployments of troops to several cities. Ohio's Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has agreed to send troops to support the administration's efforts; there are about 150 in DC right now. That voluntary directive has come to this unit. None of the three took it. They say the orders themselves were uncharacteristically vague. \"What exactly are we going to be doing? Are we going to have leave? And those answers aren't very clear — but in the past, it's always been very clear,\" says A. \"Anywhere that we go, there's crucial information that we get about the why behind it. And whenever we don't get that, especially for these city moves, members ask questions.\" Growing anti-guard sentiment A joined the guard to pay for college. J was looking for direction in life. And C felt the pull of the benefits that the guard offers and to serve her country. All three have served for years, even decades. The three say they are grappling with whether to leave the guard, and end their military careers. \"The only reason I want to finish my current contract is just because I feel like there's weight to what I do and say right now, and I just want to use that to do some good,\" says J. C says she has been proud of her military career and how she has served — noting that she's served on missions that she didn't necessarily agree with before. But she worries these deployments could change that. She says she's spent a lot of time thinking about what line she won't cross. \"I've been in therapy. Lots of therapy has taken me to the point where at least I can be okay if I have to say goodbye. That sucks. Is this tarnishing my service? Is it undoing everything I thought I was fighting for?\" she says. The three say they've felt anti-guard sentiment from some of their community and in their civilian lives. \"Everything that has been happening is so counter to doctrine, and so counter to what we've been taught,\" C says. Their thoughts The Trump administration has publicly talked about using the  National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration enforcement  — something broadly illegal under US law. That bothers the three guard members. \"There is no way I would participate in that,\" says J. \"I just think when everything is said and done, people are going to have to answer for what we're seeing now, and I don't want to be any part of it.\" A also says he's been wrestling with what he'd do if made to participate. \"I think, like, establishing those boundaries with yourself: What am I willing to do? What am I willing to give up? And where do I draw those lines?\" he says. The idea of troops patrolling U.S. streets — even if they're only picking up trash — is also problematic for the Ohio guard members. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's kind of like fearmongering. People who don't see people in uniform every day, you send 50 of them out to walk their street, it's going to send a message,\" J says. DeBarros, the director of About Face, says she knows the tactic well. \"In Afghanistan, we used to regularly carry out what are called presence patrols, where there was no purpose or mission other than to be present in the space and normalizing that we were there,\" she said. \"Letting people know, oh, if you act up, we are here, and we're watching.\" C has been thinking a lot about what she's willing to give up and the potential consequences. \"I swore an oath to the Constitution, not a person,\" she says. \"I just really, really implore my peers and everybody outside looking in, to just think about that. Really think about that, and think about what that means. And if there are questions, ask them. Keep talking.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5600733","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Many would-be buyers are frozen out of the housing market","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that first-time homebuyers are increasingly older, with the average age now at 40 — a record high — and only about one in five homes sold to first-time buyers.

homebuyers are getting older.  So much so, the National Association of Realtors had to scrap the photo it was planning to use on the cover of  a new report .  \"The original cover had a very cute, young couple who was expecting, and I said, 'That's not going to work,'\" says Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist for the Realtors' association. \"We're not seeing young couples, unfortunately, so it didn't match.\"  Instead, the Realtors went with photo showing a couple near retirement age — more representative of the average buyer's age, 59, in today's high-priced market. Among first-time buyers, the average age was 40 —  an all-time high.   First-time buyers accounted for only about one in five homes sold during the 12 months ending in June.  That's a record low and half the share of first-time buyers a generation ago.   \"It shows some real problems in the housing market that need to be addressed,\" Lautz says. \"When we look at the lack of inventory for young adults to be able to purchase what ends up being their biggest financial asset and to bring them into the housing ladder, we have work to do.\"  Eve Burdick and husband Cael just celebrated their first wedding anniversary.

A new report shows people are waiting until they're much older to buy that first home than in past years. The report underscores how challenging it's become for young people to get a foothold in the costly housing market, as NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Eve Burdick and her husband, Cael, just celebrated their first wedding anniversary. They're both 30 years old and at the stage of life when they'd like to be shopping for their first home. In fact, Eve Burdick has been window-shopping. EVE BURDICK: Oh my gosh, all the time. Are you kidding me? (Laughter) I am on Zillow. My mom sends me stuff pretty much multiple times a week (laughter). HORSLEY: But even though home prices in Minneapolis, where the couple lives, are below the national average, everything they look at is far above their price range or needs more fixing up than the couple could afford. BURDICK: There is no feasible way that we could buy a house for $350,000 and then pull a home equity line of credit to drywall the basement. HORSLEY: Burdick says by the time her parents were her age, they'd already owned a home for several years. But in today's pricey market, that's uncommon. A new report from the National Association of Realtors says the average person buying their first home this past year was 40 years old - an all-time high. Deputy Chief Economist Jessica Lautz says the association had to scrap the photo that was supposed to go on the cover of the report. JESSICA LAUTZ: The original cover had a very cute young couple who was expecting, and I said, that's not going to work. We're not seeing young couples, unfortunately, so it didn't match. HORSLEY: Instead, the realtors went with a photo showing a couple near retirement age, more representative of today's average buyer. Lautz says first-time buyers accounted for just 21% of home sales during this past year. That's a record low and about half the share of first-time buyers a generation ago. LAUTZ: It shows some real problems in the housing market that need to be addressed. For young adults to be able to purchase what ends up being their biggest financial asset and to bring them into the housing ladder, we have work to do. HORSLEY: Part of the problem is that people who already own homes, often with much lower mortgage rates, are staying put longer - a record 11 years on average. That means fewer houses are available to new buyers, a situation Lautz describes as gridlock. The overall shortage of homes is compounded by the high price of other necessities, which makes it hard for first-time buyers to save up a down payment. Many are also saddled with student or medical debt. Sasha Skelton's 34. Her partner's 36. She works in HR for a bank. He's in property management. Skelton wishes they'd been able to buy a home a few years ago when interest rates were lower, but they were repeatedly outbid, often by older, wealthier buyers. Today, she says, everything in their Richmond, Virginia, suburb seems so expensive. She's also nervous about the job market and the overall economy. SASHA SKELTON: It makes me cautious about really wanting to take a jump where, if we have our jobs fall out from underneath of us, our house could be taken away. And, like, with the increase in groceries, it's just everything is kind of coming all at once, it feels like. HORSLEY: For now, Skelton and her partner have put house-hunting on the back burner. But they haven't given up. SKELTON: Both him and I have moved around a lot. I was an Army brat, so it would be nice to, like, settle down and have a home where we can, like, kind of put our roots in. It's just the market right now is not where we want it. HORSLEY: Mortgage rates have been inching down in recent months, but they're still more than twice as high as they were a few years ago. Meanwhile, the average home price just keeps going up. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

more could be cut if the shutdown doesn’t end. What to know if you’re about to fly \n       \n  By Holly Yan, Pete Muntean, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:29 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Travel plans for millions of Americans could come to a screeching halt this month as more flights get canceled during the longest  government shutdown  in US history.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,000 Friday flights were slashed on the first day of the Trump administration’s mandatory cuts to reduce US air traffic, a majority due to the cuts mandated because of the shutdown. And flyers face further travel disruptions through the weekend as airlines are now canceling hundreds of additional flights.\n \n\n   \n  Officials said the cancellations are needed to maintain safety, as some air traffic controllers and federal security screeners – who aren’t getting paid during the shutdown – are not showing up to work.\n \n\n   \n  But the reduction in flights has not eased the cascading delays for travelers across the country due to air traffic controller staffing shortages, as more than 4,500 flights were delayed Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The cancellations and delays are mostly due to a combination of air traffic controller staffing issues and an Federal Aviation Administration-mandated 4% cut to flights because of the shutdown.   \n \n\n   \n  Friday’s cuts represent a 4% reduction in flights at  40 of the largest airports nationwide . If the shutdown drags on, airlines would have to gradually cancel more flights in the coming days – potentially leading to 10% of flights axed next Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know as bewildered travelers get hit by the shutdown:\n \n\n   \n    Which 40 airports are losing flights?\n \n\n   \n  Airlines must cancel flights to 40 “high-volume traffic” airports, the FAA said. Each airline can decide which specific flights to cut, as long as they meet the mandatory number of cancellations.\n \n\n   \n   Here are those airports, divided by region: \n \n\n   \n   Northeast:  Boston Logan International, Newark Liberty International, New York John F. Kennedy International, New York LaGuardia, Philadelphia International and Teterboro in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n   Midwest:  Chicago Midway International, Chicago O’Hare International, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County, Indianapolis International, Louisville Muhammad Ali International and Minneapolis-St. Paul International.\n \n\n   \n   South:  Charlotte Douglas International, Dallas-Fort Worth International, Dallas Love Field, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International, George Bush Houston Intercontinental, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, Houston Hobby, Memphis International, Orlando International, Miami International and Tampa International.\n \n\n   \n   DC area:  Baltimore/Washington International, Ronald Reagan Washington National and Washington Dulles International.\n \n\n   \n   West:  Denver International, Harry Reid International Airport, Los Angeles International, Oakland International, Ontario International, Phoenix Sky Harbor International, Portland International, Salt Lake City International, San Diego International, San Francisco International and Seattle/Tacoma International.\n \n\n   \n   Hawaii and Alaska:  Daniel K. Inouye International and Ted Stevens Anchorage International.\n \n\n   \n  Many smaller airports could also be impacted, as some flights from those 40 high-traffic airports fly to those locations.\n \n\n   \n    How many flights will be cut, and when?\n \n\n   \n  The FAA told airlines to cut traffic by 4% at 40 major airports, resulting in about 800 flights slashed for Friday. There are currently 1,700 flight cancellations through Sunday, according to data from Cirium, an aviation analytics company.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, more than 1,000 flights were canceled Friday in the US, which includes cancellations that are not shutdown-related, according to FlightAware.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines might have to cancel 6% of their flights to those airports on Tuesday, 8% Thursday and 10% next Friday if the stalemate continues, the FAA says.\n \n\n   \n  If the impasse drags on – and not enough air traffic controllers go to work – the Department of Transportation might hike cancellations to 15%-20%,  DOT Secretary Sean Duffy  told Fox News on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to see that,” Duffy said. “If controllers start coming to work and the pressure goes down, we can move those numbers in the other direction.”\n \n\n   \n  But travelers can still see flight cancellations even if the government were to reopen next week, as the FAA’s emergency order requires airlines to cancel flights days in advance.\n \n\n   \n  And air traffic controllers probably wouldn’t return to work right away, Duffy said.\n \n\n   \n    What airports are seeing flight delays?\n \n\n   \n  The control towers at nine airports were short-staffed Friday, including airports in Austin, Texas; Burbank, California; Newark, New Jersey; New Orleans; Ontario, California; San Francisco; Tampa; and near Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA reports 32 facilities were understaffed, even as airlines were forced to cut flights.\n \n\n   \n  Flights headed to Ronald Reagan Washington National had to wait an average of four hours before taking off Friday evening, according to an advisory from the FAA.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco International Airport’s control tower has also been facing staffing shortages, forcing inbound travelers to wait on the ground about an hour for takeoff.\n \n\n   \n  Flights headed to Phoenix were delayed 90 minutes and those headed to Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport were delayed 61 minutes. Manchester, New Hampshire-bound flights had delays of 45 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Flights headed to Houston’s William Hobby Airport are delayed an average of nearly three hours. The city’s other main airport, George Bush Intercontinental, is seeing incoming delays of 46 minutes, and departures are delayed 30 minutes. Dallas Love Field’s delays began growing to 30 minutes and Austin, Texas, has 47-minute average delays.\n \n\n   \n    How many Friday flights did the biggest airlines cancel?\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines has canceled about 170 regional and mainline flights scheduled for Friday, a spokesperson told CNN.   \n \n\n   \n  United Airlines canceled about 200 flights Friday – mostly regional flights. It will cancel another 4% of its flights Saturday and Sunday, United said.\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines’ 4% reduction equals about 220 flights canceled each day from Friday through Monday, spokesperson Sarah Jantz told CNN. “Even with these cancellations,” Jantz said, “we plan to operate around 6,000 daily flights.”\n \n\n   \n  About 120 Southwest Airlines flights are canceled for Friday, the airline said.\n \n\n   \n    What should I do if I plan to fly soon?\n \n\n   \n  Airline officials are urging people to book backup tickets on different carriers and waiving fees for passengers who want to change their tickets.\n \n\n   \n  “If you are flying Friday or in the next ten days and need to be there or don’t want to be stranded I highly recommend booking a backup ticket on another carrier,” Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle  posted  on Instagram.\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t book a basic ticket. For example, book Economy on Frontier so you can reuse the ticket value as changes are free or you can get a credit,” Biffle wrote. “If your flight is cancelled your chances of being stranded are high so I would simply have a backup ticket on another airline.”\n \n\n   \n  American, Delta, Southwest, United and Frontier are all offering waivers to allow passengers who do not want to fly to change their tickets without fees.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also helpful to book directly with an airline instead of through a third-party website.   If you book through another company and your flight gets canceled, you might have to deal with a third party to get your problem resolved.\n \n\n   \n  And try to avoid booking flights with layovers, the  US Public Interest Research Group  says. The more planes you have to jump on to reach your destination, the more chances you have for a flight to be delayed or canceled.\n \n\n   \n    What if I’m stuck at an airport and my flight gets canceled? Will anyone pay for a hotel?\n \n\n   \n  Airlines must give passengers full refunds for flight cancellations, the DOT says. But they don’t have to pay for hotels, meals or other expenses if a delay or cancelation isn’t their fault.\n \n\n   \n  Even though airlines can choose which flights to cancel as part of the mandatory cuts, the cancellations are not considered to be the airlines’ fault.\n \n\n   \n    How are travelers managing disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  When flights are canceled, most passengers will be automatically rebooked by airlines on flights with different departure times or connections.\n \n\n   \n  Some travelers are left without backup options and others simply don’t want to risk further travel disruptions, so they have given up on flying and resorted to renting cars to reach their destinations.\n \n\n   \n  Two car rental companies, Hertz and Turo, are reporting a significant uptick in car rental bookings as cancellations and delays upend travel plans.\n \n\n   \n  For Hertz, one-way rental bookings made over the last two days for this weekend spiked 20% compared to the same time last year, according to a company spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  Nationwide bookings for Turo cars on Friday jumped 30% year-over-year, and the company is reporting a 44% search volume increase “in a number of key markets impacted by the shutdown,” a spokesperson told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    Will international flights be impacted?\n \n\n   \n  Probably not. The flight reduction order “does not require a reduction in international flights,” a  statement  from the FAA and DOT said. However, “Carriers may use their own discretion to decide which flights are canceled to reach the order’s goal.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words: Airlines get to pick which flights they will cut. But it’s unlikely they will cancel international flights, since they generally bring in more revenue than domestic flights and are subject to international agreements.\n \n\n   \n    Why is all this happening?\n \n\n   \n  The government shutdown, which started on October 1, has prevented many federal employees from getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration screeners are considered essential employees and are expected to go to work during the shutdown. But they’re not getting paid, and some have needed to find other sources of income to pay the bills.\n \n\n   \n  “Controllers are resigning every day now because of the prolonged nature of the shutdown,” said Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. “We’re also 400 controllers short — shorter than we were in the 2019 shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 480 staffing shortages have been reported at FAA facilities since the shutdown began, which is more than four times what was recorded on the same dates last year, according to FAA operations plans.\n \n\n   \n    If airports are short-staffed, is it still safe to fly?\n \n\n   \n  The longer the shutdown continues, the more risks could emerge – especially as controllers go longer without pay, the union leader said earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Every single day that this goes on, tomorrow is now less safe than today,” Daniels  told CNN  before the flight reductions.\n \n\n   \n  But the new flight cancelations will help maintain safety, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “THIS is safety management, the very foundation of our aviation system, and it’s the right thing to do,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy  posted  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “NTSB has repeatedly stated low air traffic control staffing levels, mandatory overtime, and six-day work weeks have a direct impact on  #safety .”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alexandra Skores, Aaron Cooper, Forrest Brown, Rebekah Riess, Tori B. Powell and David Williams contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604293","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:48:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court declines to revisit gay marriage decision","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a petition from former Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses under the Obergefell v.

The challenge to the court's 2015 ruling came from Kim Davis, the former Kentucky clerk who refused to issue same-sex licenses after the court's Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. In the aftermath of her refusal, Davis was jailed for acting in contempt of court and lost her clerk re-election. A jury also ordered her to pay $360,000 to a couple who she refused to marry. Davis attempted to get out of paying this verdict by additionally requesting that the court assert that she has a First Amendment religious protection from liability for her actions. The court declined her petition without comment. Davis has long argued that religious liberties conflict with Obergefell.  \"If ever there was a case of exceptional importance, the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it,\" she argued in her  petition  before the court. She is not alone in wanting to challenge the legality of same-sex marriage. According to  Lambda Legal , which advocates for gay rights, in this year alone at least nine states have entertained bills or resolutions criticizing Obergefell or have sought to limit marriage to heterosexual couples. On Oct. 24, the Supreme Court of Texas  adopted language  allowing judges to refuse to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies due to religious beliefs.  In his concurring opinion in the case that overturned the constitutional right to abortion, Justice Clarence Thomas  expressly stated  that the Supreme Court should reconsider its stances on birth control, same-sex marriage, and same-sex intimacy. Had the Supreme Court decided to hear Davis' case and later overturn Obergefell, same-sex marriage would still be protected on the federal level. In 2022, former President Joe Biden signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act, which repeals the Defense of Marriage Act and recognizes the legitimacy of same-sex and interracial marriages. If Obergefell was overturned, however, individual states could refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. The court's decision to not hear Davis's petition means that the constitutionality of same-sex marriage is reaffirmed, at least for now. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5603659","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:57:00-05:00","title":"Senators Take First Step Toward Reopening the Government After Historic Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan Senate agreement on November 9, 2025, passed a crucial procedural step toward ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, with a 60–40 vote to fund operations through January 30, 2026.

reopening the government after historic shutdown \n         By Claudia Grisales, Luke Garrett \n        \n           Sunday, November 9, 2025 • 10:57 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A bipartisan group of Senate Democrats and Republicans reached a deal to  reopen the government  after the longest shutdown in U.S. history, voting on the first procedural step on the measure. The agreement would fund the government through Jan. 30 and include full-year funding for a trio of appropriations bills, including full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or  SNAP , through Sept. 30, 2026, or the end of the fiscal year. The vote late on Sunday was 60 to 40, with seven Democrats and one independent joining with most Republicans to advance the measure. It marked the first, but crucial, step towards passing the measure in the Senate. Once the bill cleared the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster, any remaining Senate votes need just a simple majority. However, the legislation still needs to pass the House before the shutdown would end, enabling  air traffic controllers  and other federal workers to get paid and federal food benefits to resume, among other things. Senate Democrats had earlier voted against more than a dozen short-term spending measures in their fight to preserve health care subsidies. But as the pain of the shutdown continued to bite, some agreed to more modest changes in the latest framework. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The continuing resolution to fund the government until the end of January would also include language to reverse any reductions in force of federal employees that happened during the shutdown, as well as protections against further such layoffs through the end of the fiscal year, and backpay for all federal employees during the shutdown. \"I have long said that to earn my vote, we need to be on a path toward fixing Republicans' health care mess and to protect the federal workforce,\" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said in a statement. \"This deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which Republicans weren't willing to do.\" The agreement to reopen the government is also expected to include a Senate vote on health care by the second week of December, on a bill of Democrats' choosing. That informal deal is not part of the legislative text. Democrats are deeply divided about the compromise measure, which was opposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \"I think it's a terrible mistake,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said of the deal. \"The American people want us to stand and fight for healthcare.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Democratic divisions over legislation Several top Democrats in the House also vowed to vote against the bill. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., panned the agreement in a statement before the Senate vote. \"We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries said in a statement. \"We will fight the GOP bill in the House of Representatives, where Mike Johnson will be compelled to end the seven week Republican taxpayer-funded vacation.\" And Democrat Rep. Greg Casar of Texas called the deal a \"betrayal\" and a \"capitulation\" because it doesn't reduce health care costs. The House has not held a vote since Sept. 19, and previously passed a government funding measure without Democratic support. The Senate deal on government funding comes after Democrats cruised to a series of  electoral victories in the last week , giving some in the party newfound political confidence to continue to fight for health care extensions. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many Democrats believed that keeping the government shut down gave them their only legislative leverage, with Republicans still in control of Congress and the White House. Moderate Democrats defended their votes, with some telling reporters that it's the best deal they could do. Kaine, one of the Democrats who voted for the measure on Sunday, defended his support, saying Democrats would be able to put important health care legislation up for a vote. \"Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don't, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,\" he said in his statement. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604174","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"08:08:00-05:00","title":"Trump grants pardons to Giuliani, Meadows, others linked to 2020 election efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has issued pardons to 77 individuals, including Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, and Sidney Powell, who were accused of attempting to overturn the 2020 election results.

listed were charged with or accused of various crimes or conduct related to attempts to subvert the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claimed to have won.   Some faced state prosecutions, while others were never charged. A proclamation  published on Martin's personal X account  late Sunday listed 77 people who received \"full, complete, and unconditional\" pardons, including Rudy Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and Sidney Powell, a former Trump attorney who spread conspiracy theories about ballot fraud after Trump lost the 2020 election. Powell is one of four pardon recipients who previously pleaded guilty in a Georgia court after being indicted for trying to subvert the 2020 election results in Georgia. The pardons are largely symbolic as none of the names listed were ever charged with federal crimes.

Presidents do not hold the power to pardon state crimes. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The proclamation appeared to have been signed on Friday. It also made clear that Trump was not among those being pardoned. Trump has previously said  he had the \"absolute right\"  to pardon himself – a claim that remains untested. The Supreme Court granted the president broad immunity for official acts committed during his presidency. In a statement to NPR, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,\" adding: \"President Trump is putting an end to the Biden Regime's communist tactics once and for all.\" In January, Trump  pardoned some 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters  who participated in the siege on the U.S. Capitol four years ago.

First Amendment \n         By Cory Turner \n        \n           Saturday, November 8, 2025 • 1:21 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment rights of Education Department employees when it replaced their personalized out-of-office e-mail notifications with partisan language blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"When government employees enter public service, they do not sign away their First Amendment rights,\" U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper  wrote in his decision  on Friday, \"and they certainly do not sign up to be a billboard for any given administration's partisan views.\" The lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE). \"This ridiculous ploy by the Trump administration was a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the workers at the Education Department,\" said Rachel Gittleman, the president of AFGE Local 252, which represents many Education Department workers, in a statement. She added it is \"one of the many ways the Department's leadership has threatened, harassed and demoralized these hardworking public servants in the last 10 months.\" Cooper ordered the department to restore union members' personalized out-of-office email notices immediately. If that could not be done, he warned, then the department would be required to remove the partisan language from all employees' accounts, union member or not. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       According to court records, in the run-up to the government shutdown, Education Department employees were told to create an out-of-office message for their government email accounts to be used while workers were furloughed. The department even gave employees boilerplate language they could adapt that simply said: \"We are unable to respond to your request due to a lapse in appropriations for the Department of Education. We will respond to your request when appropriations are enacted. Thank you.\" But, on the shutdown's first day, the department's deputy chief of staff for operations overrode staffers' personal messages and replaced them with this partisan autoreply: \"Thank you for contacting me. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.\" While the message was written in the first person, multiple employees  told NPR  they did not write it and were not told it would replace the out-of-office messages they had written. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At the time, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications, said in a statement to NPR: \"The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where's the lie?\" In his decision, Cooper lambasted the department for \"turning its own workforce into political spokespeople through their official email accounts. The Department may have added insult to injury, but it also overplayed its hand.\" The department did not respond to an NPR request to comment on the ruling. \"Nonpartisanship is the foundation of the federal civil-service system,\" Cooper wrote, a principle that Congress enshrined in the Hatch Act. That law, passed in 1939, was intended to protect public employees from political pressure and, according to the  U.S. Office of Special Counsel , \"to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604283","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:05:00-11:05","title":"FDA will lift warnings on hormone therapy for menopause","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is lifting black box safety warnings from hormone therapies used to manage menopause and perimenopause, including creams, pills, and patches.

The FDA will lift warnings on hormone therapy for menopause \n         By Sydney Lupkin \n        \n           Monday, November 10, 2025 • 11:05 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Food and Drug Administration says it is removing the black box safety warnings from all hormone therapy creams, pills and other treatments prescribed to ease the symptoms of menopause and perimenopause. The prominent warnings said these therapies could raise the risks for some cancers, dementia, heart attacks and strokes. That, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told  CBS News' Norah O'Donnell , scared women from using drugs that could in fact improve their health. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We now have a more nuanced understanding, and we want to put that fear machine in its proper context and let people know that there are tremendous long-term health benefits,\" Makary said. The FDA convened an expert panel in July to discuss removing them from at least low-dose vaginal estrogen. The agency then  opened a docket  to solicit comments from the public and received nearly 3,000 by the Sept. 24 deadline. In its formal comment, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, or ACOG, wrote that it has \"long encouraged\" the agency to reevaluate warning labels on low-dose estrogen products administered vaginally, but it considers those separate from systemic estrogen products that deliver the hormone throughout the body, such as pills and patches. Doctors had gone back and forth about the risks versus benefits of hormone replacement therapy for years. In 2002, researchers rang the alarm about them because a long-term study called  the Women's Health Initiative  found that hormone therapy was associated with increased risk of cancer and stroke. Since then, additional research has shown those risks were overstated, and the therapy can instead reduce heart disease when prescribed earlier. Although doctors have pushed to have the black box warnings removed, they say the special panel the FDA convened in July deviated from the usual process for making such changes and lacked the rigor of the usual approach. \"While we appreciate the FDA Expert Panel's interest in reevaluating the label warnings on hormone therapy, a brief panel such as the two-hour July 17th Expert Panel should not be considered an adequate substitute for an advisory committee meeting,\" ACOG wrote in its formal comment to the agency. FDA advisory committees are made up of independent experts who evaluate scientific presentations, discuss and debate the evidence on a given topic and then vote on recommendations for the FDA. The agency doesn't always follow its committees' recommendations, but it usually does. \"Forgoing the advisory committee process runs counter to the Agency's stated goal to increase transparency.\" ACOG writes. \"Therefore, ACOG urges the FDA to delve deeper into the benefits of low-dose vaginal estrogen for [genitourinary syndrome of menopause] GSM and systemic estrogen therapy for vasomotor symptoms by convening separate advisory committee meetings, including opportunities for public engagement, before making decisions on possible labeling changes for these distinct menopausal hormone therapy options.\" In an email to NPR, the agency shared several studies in support of its decision. The studies showed that these hormone therapies reduced the risk of  Alzheimer's disease ,  heart attack  and  hip fracture . The findings aren't new, however, and were published between 1980 and 1996. The agency also cited an  analysis of 30 studies  from 1966 through 2003 that showed starting hormone replacement therapy earlier could save lives. It was published in 2004. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-37741","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:45:32+00:00","title":"Supreme Court Upholds Judicial Appointment Process Amid Calls for Reform","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent decision by the Supreme Court in a high-profile case has reignited debates about judicial independence and the balance of power within the government.

So many of you told me to pray to St. Anthony, the patron saint of lost objects — a tip that my grandma has sworn by since I was a kid. Others had some very practical advice: Look in coat pockets, lay a flashlight on the floor (if you've lost a tiny object, the beam may cast a large shadow) and — here's a good one — make sure you know what it looks like! \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Here's a roundup of advice from our audience on how to look for stuff — plus a few bonus tips from our experts. We hope this helps you quickly find whatever you're searching for. These responses have been edited for length and clarity.

What to do if you've lost a wallet  Look up your last credit card transaction, and then go to the place where you last spent the money and look around there. — Darryl Ellis, a private investigator and the head of  A-1 Detective Agency  in Illinois Watch things fall as you drop them  I have trained myself to watch things fall when I drop them. If you watch a small screw fall and see where it lands and bounces, you will have no trouble finding it. If you just look at the place where the screw was supposed to go and growl and curse, expect to have trouble finding it. — Gregory Vogt Don't ever put it in a \"special place\" The worst possible thing to do is to place something of value in a \"special place\" that is \"easy to remember\" for \"safekeeping.\" Ha! Definitely not recommended. — Shan Crockett Use a flashlight  I find a flashlight to be a useful search aid, day or night. The beam forces me to focus on a limited area. It helps me see, instead of just looking. Held near the floor, it makes things shine. A girlfriend once lost her contact outdoors, in a driveway, with snow on the ground. I waited until after dark and then quickly found the contact in a snow pile at the edge of the street. — Art Clack  Start cleaning My mother taught me this tip: When you cannot find something, clean up and you will find it. I often find the item when I'm picking up something to put it back in its proper place. — Anne Chevalier \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Check favorite hangout spots Go to the places you hang out most and look there first. Do you have a favorite place you sit on the sofa? Look through the cushions and under and behind the sofa. Do you hang out on the patio? Look in between seats and chairs or on tables outdoors. My youngest son is autistic and nonverbal. He wears glasses and sometimes comes up to me without them on his face. To look for them, I always go to his favorite places around my home. They might be in his bed, his sensory swing or the closet. I always end up finding them. — Naeemah Ford Goldson, executive director and founder,  National Association of Black Professional Organizers Make a mental note of something you're likely to lose  I make a mental note when I put something down — like my keys, glasses or phone — in a place I do not usually put it. It is akin to underlining or highlighting something in writing to help make it easier to remember. — Marc R. Inver Come back to it  Take a break from looking for your missing object and relax or do something else. Without worrying and fussing, your brain will quietly surprise you with a stored memory that will suddenly pop into your consciousness and lead you to the missing object. — Gregory Vogt Look carefully in the most obvious place Look in the most likely place it should be. Most of the time, it's there. You just overlooked it. — Kelly Connolly Make sure you know what it looks like Numerous times, my wife has sent me to get something in the basement, and I can't find it at first because she told me the wrong color, container or location.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. A few years ago, our digital editor, Malaka Gharib, lost her passport two days before a big international trip. Getting a new passport expedited would cost her hundreds of dollars, and she wasn't sure if it would even get to her in time. MALAKA GHARIB, BYLINE: You can imagine how stressed I was. I mean, the last time I saw my passport was on the bed, but I retraced my steps about a dozen times and nothing. SEGARRA: She was so stressed about the missing passport, she even took off work to look for it. GHARIB: I mean, I was really frazzled. I tore up the house, and I was checking the most random places, like the bathroom cabinets. SEGARRA: That experience made Malaka think, you know, there has to be a more methodical way of finding lost objects. GHARIB: Right. I mean, like, what do researchers know? And what about people like detectives and search-and-rescue responders? How do they hunt stuff down? SEGARRA: On this episode of LIFE KIT... (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...How to find the stuff you've lost. And we're not just going to tell you to look harder if you've lost something. Malaka will bring you useful techniques to find things that don't have an AirTag on them, whether that's something sentimental like a class ring or something valuable like an envelope full of cash or something you need to cross the border. GHARIB: And I'll reveal how I finally found my missing passport. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: So after I called my boss and told them I wasn't coming in, I went into my bedroom, where I lost my passport, and I turned it upside down. I remember feeling so overwhelmed that I wasn't looking carefully enough. That's exactly what you want to avoid when you're looking for a lost object. This is takeaway one. Your attention is like a spotlight, and you need to be able to point it at the task at hand. To do that, you've got to relax, which, I know, is the last thing you want to hear when you've lost something important. Arryn Robbins is a cognitive psychologist at the University of Richmond, and she specializes in visual search. She says that stress clouds our ability to focus. ARRYN ROBBINS: Stress can have a couple of different types of effects on us. So imagine you're highly distracted because you're thinking about something that's coming up. GHARIB: Like a big international trip that you're packing and getting ready for. ROBBINS: That type of distraction, that mental distraction is taking away attentional resources from the task at hand. GHARIB: So I was already frazzled when I was handling my passport to begin with. Then I realized I lost it, which was my second layer of stress. ROBBINS: In terms of visual processing, when you are stressed out, you have that sort of fight-or-flight response kicking in. That sympathetic nervous system is kicking into gear. Your heart is beating a little faster. You might get a little sweaty because you're anxious. What that does is it actually narrows your attention. GHARIB: So, if your attention is like a spotlight, you could increase the size of that beam or shrink it down. When it's narrow, it's almost like you're having tunnel vision. On one hand, that can be great. You're able to process your environment with a lot more detail. ROBBINS: But you, to some degree, need your attention sort of expanded in order to get the gist of your search environment to know where to put that spotlight next. GHARIB: So take a moment to widen that beam. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ROBBINS: It helps to take a breath, kind of calm the body down because it really is your body response to that stress that's causing that restriction in attention. GHARIB: Once you've calmed down and centered yourself again, it's time to start hunting. Takeaway two, if you've lost something important, think about the features of the object that would really make it stand out in the environment. Arryn says it'll make your search easier and more efficient. ROBBINS: When you are looking for objects, you're using a bunch of different cognitive processes in your brain, but the two most important ones are memory and attention. GHARIB: You're going to rely on your memory to remind you of what the lost object looks like and its likely location. ROBBINS: Its visual features like color, shape, texture, size, memory for where the object is most likely going to be, and that information in memory is used to direct your attention. GHARIB: Say you're looking for a white sedan in the parking lot. To find it, you're not going to look at every single car in the lot. ROBBINS: Your attention is going to be directed to cars that are white, that are sedan-shaped. You're going to skip over the black SUVs, and that helps you save time. GHARIB: This is what scientists call attentional guidance. It's the process of moving your attention toward areas in your environment where you'd most likely find your object, including important features of your object and where you tend to keep the object. It's something we do all the time without even realizing it, when we look for a toothbrush in the morning or a favorite coffee mug. You only realize you're looking for something when it becomes challenging - for example, when you're looking for a white sedan in a parking lot full of white sedans. ROBBINS: So in that case, you have to really think about what would make this object stand apart in the scene? What are some distinctive features of this object? Maybe you have a bumper sticker that sets it apart. GHARIB: Arryn used this tactic recently when she lost the back of a rose gold earring on a carpet in a similar color. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ROBBINS: So I had to think about, OK, what would set my earring apart from this carpet that would allow me to find it? Well, my earring is shiny. It would reflect light. And so, as soon as I thought about that, like, almost instantly, I saw it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: OK. So you've tried this technique, and you still can't find what you're looking for. Time for takeaway three - think about the likely scenarios of how and where your object got lost. Demian Garcia is a metal-detecting enthusiast. For more than a decade, he's been using his metal detector to help people where he lives in Northern California find their lost jewelry in some pretty challenging environments - parks, beaches, roads. His track record is impressive. Over the years, he says he's helped recover some 50 lost objects for folks. When people pay him to find a lost object - he charges around 25 to 35 bucks a search - he starts off by asking them questions. DEMIAN GARCIA: Do you have any locations that you put it normally? Have you lost it before? Has it fallen off before while doing something? You know, some people say, oh, yeah, it always slips off when I'm in my car, and I play with my ring while I'm driving. GHARIB: Then he goes through typical ways people lose rings off their hand. He's got a lot of experience in the behavior of rings, as you can imagine. GARCIA: Did you throw anything away that day? Were you dealing with cold water? Did you put on lotion somewhere? GHARIB: And one of my favorite ways that Demian helps people find their lost jewelry without the use of a metal detector is to recreate the scene. GARCIA: An example of that was a couple were pulled over on the side of the road, and she tossed the ring out in the passenger seat. GHARIB: Side note - Demian says this scenario happens a lot. Couples get into an argument, and one of them takes off their wedding band and chucks it out the window in anger. But then they make up, and then they can't find where they threw their ring. So they contact Demian. GARCIA: And she kept going, it's right there. I threw it straight out the window right there. GHARIB: Demian wondered, was it really right there? He wanted to test the theory, so he took a cheap ring, tied a long red ribbon on to it and asked the woman to throw the ring out the window again like she did with her wedding ring. GARCIA: Well, she threw it three times in a row, and it never went straight out the window, like you would think. It went flying back behind the car because of her arm going out the window makes her hand throw it towards the back of the car. So it went back about 20 feet to the rear of the car, going a different direction. GHARIB: Using this technique, he was able to find the woman's ring. Yay, Demian. So the next time you lose something, try recreating the potential movement of the object. I should've done that with my passport. I could've taken something similar to it, like a little booklet or something, laid it on my bed, the last place I saw it, and I could've ruffled the duvet cover around to see where something of that size and weight might have landed because where I ultimately found it was not that far from my bed, actually. More on the exact spot later. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: At this point in your search, you've probably looked in some pretty obvious places. Now it's time to change your perspective and scour elsewhere. This is takeaway four. Michael Hout is a cognitive psychologist and the director of the Vision Sciences and Memory Lab at New Mexico State University. He specializes in how people find things and where and why people move their eyes. He was telling me about this experiment that one of his students did. She had participants look for objects in a campus courtyard, and she found that people tended only to look at the ground when they searched. MICHAEL HOUT: So they're not looking up. They're just kind of walking in a straight line and sweeping back and forth with their head and their eyes in front of them. GHARIB: This is different from how search-and-rescue responders and law enforcement operate. These professionals scan their environment in 360 degrees. That means... HOUT: Looking down, looking up, looking left and right, crouching down to change your perspective, turning around to view things that weren't visible to you when you first approached them. GHARIB: He says if you've lost something, you need to engage in these kinds of perspective-changing behaviors, too. That also means looking in unexpected places. So if you can't find your keys in the places where you normally leave them - your purse, your pocket, the entryway table at the front door... HOUT: You also have to then sort of force yourself to look in the low-probability areas. I think sometimes people put their keys in weird places, or they drop them or someone moves them. GHARIB: Search-and-rescue responders use this technique when they look for missing persons in the wilderness. Instead of just looking on a trail for clues like footprints or a cell phone, they look up at the trees and off the beaten path. HOUT: A windbreaker that someone shed when they were getting hot, for example, might have been picked up by the wind and blown into a bush or a tree. GHARIB: When I was looking for my passport, I actually checked inside the fridge. I know this sounds far-fetched, but maybe I was holding it, intending to put in my backpack, got hungry and then brought it into the kitchen with me. No, I did not find it in the fridge, but it was still good that I did that anyway. This exercise is all about breaking out of the way you would normally search for something. HOUT: And that takes a little bit of additional effort to sort of force yourself out of the routine that you might automatically use to look for something. GHARIB: At this point, if you've looked in some weird places and you still can't find your lost object, it's time to bust out a more serious search technique. Takeaway five, divide your space up into sections and then search each section thoroughly. Arryn says grid search, as it's called, is one form of systematic search. It's sometimes used in search and rescue as a last resort to find missing people. But it can also be a useful tool if you're looking for something in a messy room, where your missing object's distinctive features may be hard to spot. ROBBINS: It's going to be slow, less efficient, but it's going to ensure that you find the thing that you're looking for. And so, in this case, you might imagine that your search environment, whether it's a room or an office space, is like a grid, and you want to cover each square in the grid, maybe top to bottom, left to right. GHARIB: Arryn says the general idea is to come up with a strategy to be thorough without having to remember every location you've already looked at. You don't necessarily have to measure out a grid. Just imagine breaking down the search environment into smaller units - sections of a room, pieces of furniture - then search those units in an order that makes sense to you. Arryn says you are likely going to forget where you searched, so have a way to remember the places you already sifted through. When I lost my passport in my bedroom, I deployed a similar strategy. I divided the room into sections, and I put a Post-it note where I had already looked. Arryn thought that was an excellent strategy, but did I find my passport with this method? No. Looking back on my journey to find my passport, I realize I did one thing right. I was persistent. That's our final takeaway, takeaway six - be persistent. GHARIB: Darryl Ellis is head of A-1 Detective Agency in Illinois. He's been a private investigator since 1996. His whole job is to find stuff, people, to, say, serve them legal papers, but sometimes physical items like vintage cars and important documents. I asked him what it takes to be a good detective. DARRYL ELLIS: If I had to use one word, I would say tenacity. It's my client asking me to do a - perform a service for them, and I try to do my best to locate anybody that they're requesting me to locate. GHARIB: Darryl can spend hours doing surveillance, following targets, taking photos of them, logging their whereabouts, weeks tracking down information about the location of a specific individual. ELLIS: I mean, I'm looking for a gentleman now I've been looking for for a month, and we've, you know, pulled out all the resources trying to locate him. I've been to five or six addresses, and he hasn't lived there. GHARIB: Darryl says he'll keep looking as long as his clients want him to. But Demian says sometimes they give up before he does. GARCIA: Sometimes, they don't have the patience. And they're, you know, an hour into it, two hours into it, and I'm on my hands and knees and crawling through bushes and stuff, and they're looking at me like, you don't have to go anymore looking and you don't - you know, they're kind of like, well, I guess it's gone, and I just tell them, no, no, I don't give up until I'm satisfied. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: So if you've lost something you really care about, keep going. Don't lose hope. When I was looking for my passport, I remember sitting on my bed and looking around the room. At this point, it was about 3 p.m. and my brain was fried. There were Post-it notes everywhere. I had emptied all the drawers in my cabinet to see if the passport was in there. And I just had this moment of clarity. The passport has to be near the bed. It has to be, because that's where I last saw it, and I don't remember taking it anywhere else. So I pushed the mattress off the bed, and where did I find it? Wedged between the wall of the bed and the side of the mattress. Hallelujah. Reflecting back on that wild, wild search, I truly believe that if I had these tips I just gave you, I would have found it a lot faster. And listen, if you don't find the object you're looking for, hold on to the fact that you tried really, really hard to find it. That's what Demian does. GARCIA: It may help to know that I did my best to look for it, you know, and not to spend time looking in areas that I have looked, and, you know, maybe it'll show up someday. Or if not, you know, you did the best you could. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: Let's recap. Takeaway one, your attention is a spotlight. You need to be relaxed so you can widen your beam and stay focused on your search. Takeaway two, speed up your search by identifying the qualities of your missing object that make it stand out from the environment. Takeaway three, search the obvious. Think about the likely scenarios of how and why your object might have gotten lost to begin with and where it might be. Takeaway four, change your perspective. Professional finders like search-and-rescue responders don't just look at the floor. They look behind, they look above, and they look off the beaten path. Takeaway five, create a systematic way of searching for your lost object. Divide your room into a grid, search each square thoroughly and use Post-it notes to mark where you've already looked. And, finally, takeaway six, don't give up. Be persistent, just like our detective and our metal-detecting enthusiast, and you'll hopefully find what you're looking for.

Last week, a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to immediately fully fund SNAP, accusing the government of holding back for \"political purposes\" and causing \"needless suffering.\" The administration said it would send those payments, even as it appealed the order. Then, the  Supreme Court on Friday  granted a request to pause full payments while the appeals court considers the issue. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Now the administration is threatening that states that do send full payments to SNAP recipients may end up having to cover the costs themselves, and could also face financial penalties. The U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a statement  Saturday that any such payments were \"unauthorized\" and sending full payments \"may result in USDA taking various actions, including cancellation of the Federal share of State administrative costs and holding States liable for any over issuances that result from the noncompliance.\" The USDA said states must continue to reduce the benefits they are sending by 35%, as the Trump administration had instructed states to do last week to comply with an earlier court order. Rhode Island is one of several states that had already sent full benefits to SNAP recipients before the Supreme Court temporarily halted full payments. In a statement Sunday, Democratic Gov. Dan McKee railed against President Trump, saying he \"intentionally created chaos for states across the country — playing games with people's ability to feed their families, weaponizing hunger, and gaslighting the American people. It's inhumane.\" McKee said he was working on contingency options \"to protect Rhode Islanders against President Trump's volatility.\" Even before the Trump administration threatened consequences for states that send full payments, some two dozen states, including Rhode Island, asked a federal judge in Massachusetts for protection. In a brief filed Saturday, the states said they feared that the federal government \"may attempt to recoup funds from the States that the States' residents have used to feed themselves and their families.\" That could amount to hundreds of million dollars, they said, and would \"risk catastrophic operational disruptions for the States, with a consequent cascade of harms for their residents.\" Trump administration officials did not respond to requests for comment. But over the weekend, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins  took to X to blame Democrats  for the lapse in benefits, and railed against \"activist judges\" who have ordered \"reckless and unconstitutional legal maneuvers\" to force funding that Congress didn't appropriate. Speaking to Fox News, Rollins borrowed language from anti-Trump activists. \"It's interesting, the 'No Kings' rally, where they said 'we don't want a King in America,'\" Rollins said. \"Except now they want a king who can create money out of the clear blue sky.\" Meanwhile, SNAP recipients remain in limbo, as do the organizations that serve them. The Facing Hunger Foodbank in Huntington, W.V., has tripled the volume of food distributions that are usual this time of year, according to CEO Cynthia Kirkhart. People are struggling, she says, and all the uncertainty has just exacerbated their pain. \"The news comes out that we are going to get SNAP benefits. Then, we aren't going to get SNAP benefits. This is much worse. Folks get their hopes built up and then they crash. It's a lot,\" Kirkhart sighs. \"We can do better.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1196978916","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00+00:00","title":"Global Efforts to Address Youth Mental Health Surge in Awareness and Policy Action","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article highlights the growing global concern over youth mental health, emphasizing a significant rise in public awareness and policy action since 2022.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MELANIE LANGFORD: And when you look at those dots, I'm going to show you two choices. And I just want you to tell me which makes the edges sharper and clearer for you. ANDEE TAGLE, HOST:   OK. LANGFORD: Do those look clearer with one or two? TAGLE: One. Hey there, this is Andee Tagle in for Marielle Segarra and reporting from the office of optometrist Melanie Langford here in San Diego, Calif. When you think about eye health, this is usually the image that comes to mind - right? - sitting in a dark office in a big leather chair, two great big wheels of lenses in front of your face making you feel like an owl, and little rows of letters across the room making you sweat. There's no way they'd put three Z's in a row - right? LANGFORD: And seven or eight? TAGLE: Eight. LANGFORD: OK, perfect. So you do not appear to have any astigmatism. TAGLE: What's astigmatism again? This part, the eye exam part of eye care, is for the average healthy-sighted person. Pretty straightforward and, in my opinion, pretty cool. LANGFORD: So you're nearsighted. TAGLE: OK. LANGFORD: And then this is what your... TAGLE: Whoa. LANGFORD: ...Vision is with nothing. TAGLE: I can't - that's crazy. Big difference. LANGFORD: And that's with it. TAGLE: I can see. LANGFORD: Perfect. TAGLE: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: If you talk to just about anyone who works in the field, they'll tell you - there's a lot more to eye health than meets, well, you know. Eighty percent of what we learn about the world comes in through our visual pathway. We need our eyes to perform our daily activities, do our jobs, to navigate the world around us. So eye care is so much bigger than just a prescription or an annual eye exam. So in this episode of LIFE KIT, eye health. We'll talk about how to combat eye fatigue. We'll separate eye facts from fiction. And we'll set our sights on daily practices to strengthen and enjoy our vision. Eyeballieve (ph) you're going to learn a lot. I know - one too many puns, right? I'll see myself out. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: A quick note - while this episode contains general healthy practices for sighted adults, it isn't medical advice. So if you have any worries about your eyes or your vision, you should go see your doctor. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: All right, let's jump right in with the big one first, shall we? I know you're thinking about it. I'm guessing that's why you clicked here. Yep, it's screen time. Takeaway one - screen time is hard to avoid, but digital eyestrain doesn't have to be. To give your eyes the rest they need, take lots of breaks and be mindful of your visual space. My seemingly endless scrolling and surfing throughout my day was actually the genesis for this episode - phones and iPads and TVs and laptops. Being glued to these rectangles of light for hours and hours every day just cannot be good for our eyes. In fact, it's such a problem that the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the National Eye Institute predict that half the world's population - half of everybody - will be nearsighted by the end of 2050. Screens are a potential culprit here. VALERIE LAM: So there's two systems being engaged when you are focusing so hard on the computer screen. TAGLE: That's Valerie Lam, an optometrist in Costa Mesa, Calif., whose practice also includes vision therapy - a nonsurgical approach to certain eye conditions like lazy eyes or binocular vision. LAM: So convergence is for our eyes to pull together to look at something that's close. Our computer screens are usually about 16 to 20 inches away from our eyes. That is a very near target. A very near target has a lot of demand on our eyes to be able to focus and line up. TAGLE: The other system is our accommodation system, which is kind of like the zoom feature of your eyes. LAM: It zooms in to make things look clear, just like a zoom of a camera. TAGLE: So together, these two systems pull together and zoom in. LAM: And they're holding that position for eight hours a day. That's why people feel eye fatigue or, you know, they get headaches above their eyebrows. They feel like they want to rub their temples at the end because your vision system is working so hard throughout the day. TAGLE: So what Valerie is describing is something called digital eyestrain, and it happens when you stare at screens for too long. You might get a headache. Your eyes will feel dry. You might even have neck or shoulder pain. But there's no need to fret. We've got solutions for you. The first one is catchy. You might have heard the phrase before - 20-20-20. That means for every 20 minutes of work, take a 20-second break and look 20 feet away. LAM: And why do we say 20 feet away? Because we feel like that's equal to distance, right? When your eyes are looking far away, your eyes are more relaxed. TAGLE: Simple enough. Another thing to consider is how you set up your workspace. Lots of people invest in fancy chairs or ergo keyboards. LAM: But, like, what about the ergonomics for your eyes, right? If you're on a workstation - if you have your computer screen, and behind you is a wall, there's no way for your eyes to rest. What if you were putting your computer next to a window? TAGLE: You want to think about the position of your monitor. The top of the screen should be at or just below eye level. Control for glare and brightness, too. Then, you might consider giving your eye muscles a little workout every now and again. Valerie's got an easy one for you. LAM: And we call it thumb rotations. And all you need is really your thumb. And what you're going to do is you're just going to put your thumb straight ahead of you, and you're going to make a big circle with your thumb. And you're going to follow, watching your thumb with your eyes. You're going to put your thumb in a big circle - like, up to the top of your head, out to as far as your arm can reach out to the side, and then down to the bottom. That's engaging all six of your eye muscles while you're doing that stretch. So we tell patients - we'll say do five circles with your right thumb, and then switch to the other hand and do five circles with your left thumb, going in the outward direction, so you'll go up and out. TAGLE: Then there's blue light. This is a super hot topic in the eye world. Maybe you're one of the many, many people who went out and got a pair of blue light glasses to protect your eyes in the beginning of the pandemic. Here's the thing. RUPA WONG: There have been absolutely no studies that have demonstrated any kind of negative effect of blue light on your retina, on your cataracts, on your macula. TAGLE: That's Dr. Rupa Wong. She's an ophthalmologist and clinical associate professor at the University of Hawaii John Burns School of Medicine. WONG: I think people get a little confused with ultraviolet light and blue lights from that perspective. But what blue light does is it affects your melatonin. It affects your circadian rhythms. TAGLE: So if blue light from a computer screen is in your sleep space, it might interrupt your bedtime routine just like a lot of sunshine might get in the way of a nap. But other than that, it's not really something to worry about, says Rupa. WONG: Digital eyestrain - so once we remove that aspect from digital eyestrain - because there was some thought that maybe it was related to the blue light - really, it comes down to the fact that, when we are on devices, whether it be a computer or a phone or a tablet, we tend not to blink as much, and we are focusing up close for many hours at a time. TAGLE: Blinking is a lot more important than you think it is. WONG: When we're not blinking as much, your eyes get drier. TAGLE: I know - doesn't sound like a very big deal. WONG: So the amazing thing is that your tear film is responsible for a good part of the clarity of your vision. When you have dry eyes, the vision becomes blurry, and this is something that we often see. People don't come in saying, I have dry eyes. They come in oftentimes saying, my eyes hurt, or my vision is blurred. But it comes and goes throughout the day, or when I blink, it gets a little bit better. So the ramification of having dry eyes can be really profound. And really, when you get very severe dry eyes, there are a lot of different medical problems that can be associated with severe dry eye syndrome. TAGLE: I stand corrected. Excuse me while I take 20 seconds to blink a bit. Some other options for making sure your eyes stay moist throughout the day - you could keep artificial tears handy. Not eyedrops - there is a difference. But there have been recalls lately, so you might want to do a quick search before you buy. You could also give yourself, like, a mini spa treatment at the beginning and the end of each day by putting warm compresses over your eyes. That can help moisturize the oil glands on your eyelids that you need to make oil for your tears. WONG: Do it at least for five minutes. Morning and night just might help, and it's an easy thing. It helps even for people who have allergies. I mean, there's a lot of different ways that - just having that lubricant in your tear film can be a benefit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Up next, eye hygiene - let's talk dirty details about keeping your eyes clean. They're the windows to the soul, after all, so let's make sure we treat them accordingly. Takeaway two - protect your peepers. Bacteria, sun, wind and lifestyle choices can all affect these two small, precious organs. Let's start with bacteria. I'm looking at you, contact lens wearers. WONG: When you sleep in your contact lenses, you're increasing your risk of infection of the cornea up to eight times. I've heard people, oh, I sleep in my contacts all the time, and I've never gotten an infection. Well, you're very, very lucky. That's great. But it really is setting up the perfect environment for all these microorganisms to grow and replicate. They like a nice, moist environment. So think about that image in your head before you sleep with your contact lenses. TAGLE: Rupa says usually the healthiest, though also often the most expensive and packaging-heavy option, is a daily contact. WONG: And that's because the lens material that it's made of is going to have a higher oxygen permeability. TAGLE: If you have two-week lenses or monthly lenses, she says it's important not to try and stretch the timing of them. The clock starts the minute you open the package. And remember, regardless of which type of contact you wear, life happens. So before you find yourself without contact solution or your carrying case, or the next time you want to take a nap on a plane... WONG: Just always, always, always - people need to have a good set of glasses because I think the biggest issue with wanting to take out your contact lenses at the end of the day is this - they don't have an up-to-date glasses prescription. TAGLE: Another bugaboo for eye doctors? Makeup. WONG: My ethnicity is Indian. They are all into the really tight lining, water lining, the big, dramatic eyes. So we can do all of this keeping your eyes healthy. The most important thing is to remove and wash your makeup every single night without fail. TAGLE: I'll admit I was pretty loosey-goosey about this before, and then Rupa told me this thing. WONG: They've done studies and they have shown there are Demodex lash mites that live on your lashes that come out at night. TAGLE: Lash mites - they love mascara. Look it up if you dare. Another big no-no is putting eyeliner on your waterline. That's the pink part of your eyelid. WONG: I love that look. It's not one that we recommend because it can block the oil glands of your eyelids. It can cause styes. It can cause issues with dry eyes. Also, those loose glitter eyeshadows, they tend to really fall into the eye in a lot of particulate matter. So usually, I would avoid the loose ones as well. You can do glitter shadows. The pressed ones are going to be a bit better. TAGLE: Other best practices include regularly cleaning your applicators and brushes and actually following the expiration dates on your mascara and other eye makeup. And they might be shorter than you think. Check your boxes. Most dates run somewhere in the range of three to 12 months. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Moving on to sun damage. It is no joke. Exposure to the sun, even in small amounts, over time can lead to serious eye problems, like cataracts or macular degeneration. You can develop callus-like tissue on the whites of your eyes from too much sun, dust or wind. WONG: And we can't forget the eyelid and the external structures of the eye because you can get cancers on those part of the eye, which is why sunglasses and hat use is so important. TAGLE: Rupa suggests wearing hats with at least a three-inch brim when you're outside for an extended period of time and to be cognizant not only of direct sunlight, but also things like exposure to glare or reflection from the road. Then there are sunglasses. Are they all created equal? WONG: They are not. The most important thing about sunglasses is it has a little sticker on it that says 100% UVA, UVB. TAGLE: Polarized sunglasses will make your eyes more comfortable, especially if you're wearing them in a place with a lot of glare. But be warned, unless they also specifically say UVA and UVB, you're not getting the sun protection you need. Other lifestyle factors that affect your eyesight, like diet and exercise, don't require any super special ingredients or supplements. Yes, what you've always heard is true, carrots are good for your eyes, but... WONG: It's not just about the carrots. And the beta-carotene that you get from carrots is also present in things like sweet potatoes and cantaloupe and spinach and tomatoes. TAGLE: When it comes to healthy practices, Rupa says don't overthink it. WONG: All the things that you would think about for the lifestyle factors - that if you're aiming for a healthy life. Just getting good sleep, being able to, you know, not smoke and just exercising has been shown just the same to affect your eye health just as much as it affects the rest of your body. TAGLE: Now let's turn to prescriptions - because I don't know about you, but every time I walk out of my eye doctor's office, I look at that little piece of paper, and I'm like, what in the name of middle-school science am I looking at right now? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Let's go over what you actually need to know. WONG: This was my favorite class in sixth grade. This is probably why I went into ophthalmology. I love optics so much. TAGLE: Takeaway three - understand your prescription. When you receive your prescription, you'll see two rows, OS and OD. Very simple. OS, oculus sinister, is Latin for left eye, and OD, oculus dexter, is Latin for right eye. No idea why it's necessary to be in Latin, but I digress. Your prescription can be different for each eye. Then you'll see a plus or minus number. A plus prescription means you're hyperoptic - or farsighted. In this case, you might have trouble seeing close up or even at medium distance because... WONG: The eyeball is a little bit short. So we put a stronger plus lens in front of the eye to bring that light so that it can focus onto the retina instead of behind the retina. TAGLE: If you have a minus prescription, you're myopic - or nearsighted. That means you have trouble seeing far away because... WONG: The eyeball itself is shaped a little bit longer. And because of that, we use a minus lens to push the light back so it's on the retina. TAGLE: In general, the higher your number in either direction, the worse your natural vision and the stronger the lens you'll need to be able to see clearly. But Rupa says, in particular, your doctor is going to want to keep an eye on nearsightedness - that's that minus prescription - because, in that case, your retina might be stretched more thinly than the average eye. Anything from a 0 to a -3 is considered a mild prescription; -3 to -6 is moderate. WONG: And then anything above a -6 really puts you in a very different risk category of high myopia, where you can get retinal tears, retinal detachments, cataracts, glaucoma. So anybody that's a -6 diopter or higher, then we want to make sure we're following them at least once a year, for sure. TAGLE: Now there's one more condition to be aware of on your prescription - astigmatism. WONG: So many people get really concerned about astigmatism. They worry about it. They say, oh, my gosh, doctor, I have astigmatism. And they think it's a really terrible diagnosis, and it's not. All it is is the shape of the front surface of your eyeball. TAGLE: Regular-shaped corneas are shaped like half a basketball. But people with astigmatism - their corneas look more like half a football. WONG: And because of that, the light's getting diffracted into a lot of different points. And so to bring it all into one point, we use a cylindrical lens, and that helps focus the light onto the retina. You can be nearsighted with astigmatism or farsighted with astigmatism - either one. TAGLE: All combined, that prescription should be able to give you good, clear, hopefully 20/20 vision that can help you better navigate the world around you. Curious what 20/20 means exactly? Yeah, me too. Now, this is all arbitrarily set, but 20/20 refers to what the quote-unquote, \"average\" person can see at 20 feet away. So the first 20 refers to actual distance. The second 20 refers to how close an object appears. So if you can see 20/15, that means you can see at 20 feet what a, quote, \"normal\" person can see at 15 feet. How good can you get? LANGFORD: I can go all the way down to 20/10. TAGLE: Whoa. LANGFORD: Yeah, just super vision. TAGLE: Some people can just see that. Like, super vision. That looks like a pea. That looks like a ladybug... LANGFORD: I know (laughter). TAGLE: ...Across the room. People can see that from here? LANGFORD: A little black dot. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Now that we can all read our prescriptions, let's talk about what factors actually affect them because there are a lot of myths and misconceptions out there. Takeaway four - refract or fiction. Learn what can and cannot affect the quality of your vision. For example, maybe you have a parent or grandparent who avoids using their reading glasses for fear of becoming too dependent on them. WONG: They say, oh, look, I started wearing reading glasses, and then it just all went downhill. I can't even exist without them. It's not that you've made your eyes weaker. It's simply that, now, you see more clearly with your readers on, and you notice that difference. That's it. TAGLE: And the opposite is also true. So I'm slightly nearsighted, for example. My doctor prescribed me glasses for movies, concerts, driving at night, but I'm constantly forgetting them. Rupa says I don't have to worry about making my eyes worse by not wearing my glasses every time I'm supposed to. WONG: There's nothing about glasses that changes the structure or shape, or the muscles of the eye, or the focusing ability of the eye. It's not going to change it. TAGLE: That's a relief. Though, when you do wear your frames, you're going to want to make sure you have an up-to-date prescription. WONG: If it's an old glasses prescription, it might give you some eye fatigue, it might give you eyestrain. Maybe it might give you a headache because you have to strain to see a little bit better if it's really old. But typically, it's not going to cause any lasting damage. TAGLE: Generally speaking, Rupa says that most prescriptions will stabilize around early adulthood, but that's not always the case. So let's break down what can change the quality of your vision. Some conditions, like cataracts, can be age-related. Excessive smoking and drinking have been linked to a number of eye diseases that could then worsen your vision. There are also some medical conditions that will do the same - high blood pressure, for one. WONG: And then if you have conditions like diabetes, that actually can affect the lens of your eye and can make you nearsighted. So there are a lot of medical issues. TAGLE: And then there's one more, which we've kind of delved into already. WONG: And near work is associated with becoming nearsighted. TAGLE: Near work is what it sounds like - any work that you focus on up close, as in within arm's reach. So all that screen time we were talking about definitely falls under this umbrella. Video games, computer work, but also homework time, reading, drawing - all near work, too. The good news is the fix is as simple as you think it might be - just getting away from the desktop and getting outside. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Takeaway five, our final takeaway, is take your eyes outside - often. One of the very best ways to enjoy your sight and strengthen your vision is to take in the natural world around you. WONG: Being outside is so crucial, especially in my younger patient population. TAGLE: This might sound a little hyperbolic, but there's a lot of science backing this up, especially when it comes to young eyes. Recent research suggests that regular outdoor time for kids - up to two hours a day is what both Valerie and Rupa recommend - may help slow or even prevent nearsightedness. That's a big deal. There are a couple of theories as to why this is. One is that, when you're outside looking at nature, you're spending less time looking at things so close up. Your eyes are taking more things in at a distance, which is important for eye development and eye rest. The other theory is that sunlight slows eye growth, which could help eyes from unnaturally elongating, which is a cause of nearsightedness. OK, let's go outside. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR UNLOCKING) TAGLE: But then there's the fact that it just, you know, feels good. It's a beautiful day today, Teddy (ph). Do you see the cars going by? (SOUNDBITE OF CROW CAWING) TAGLE: Use your eyes to take in all the wonders around you. That's why bother with eye care at all. Do you want to play a little I spy? I spy a big tree. (SOUNDBITE OF CHILD SNEEZING) TAGLE: (Laughter) My 9-month-old hasn't really said as much yet, but I'm pretty sure he agrees with me. You're right. We don't have to say anything. We can just take it in, huh? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK, friends. Thanks for learning how to take care of those peepers along with me. Let's recap. Takeaway one - to avoid digital eyestrain, take lots of breaks and be purposeful about your visual workspace. Takeaway two, practice good eye hygiene. That means changing out those contacts, wearing those sunglasses, and - note to self - not wearing that winged eyeliner too close or for too long. Takeaway three - to understand your eyes, understand your prescription. No letters chart necessary. Takeaway four - separate eye fact from fiction. Glasses don't change the structure of your eye.

These questions, popularized by conflict resolution facilitator Priya Parker and her book *The Art of Gathering*, are designed to cut through small talk, reveal individual personalities, and initiate deeper conversations about values, memory, and shared experiences. Examples include 'What was the first concert you went to and who took you?' or 'What's a gift you got that you deeply loved?' The article emphasizes that effective magical questions are inclusive, contextually relevant, and rooted in shared human experiences. It also provides examples of how such questions can be adapted to specific groups, like dentists, and highlights the importance of reading the group’s dynamics to ensure engagement. The piece concludes by noting that while not all questions are equally effective — such as a generic 'favorite animal' query — thoughtful, well-posed questions can transform group interactions by promoting empathy, presence, and genuine connection.","keyTakeAways":["Magical questions are designed to spark curiosity and cut through small talk, revealing personal stories and

Try asking a 'magical question' \n         By Marielle Segarra, Sam Yellowhorse Kesler, Malaka Gharib \n        \n           Thursday, May 29, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         What's the weirdest thing you've ever found in your pocket? What topic could you give a 20-minute talk on with no preparation? What's a path you almost took but didn't? If you find yourself immediately wanting to reply to these queries, there's a reason, says Priya Parker, a conflict resolution facilitator. They were designed to spark curiosity and elicit a response. She calls them \"magical questions.\" \"A magical question is a question that everyone in your group is interested in answering\" and hearing the answers to, says Parker, who hosts  a video series  on the topic on her Instagram page.  She likes asking them in group settings because they have the power to cut through small talk and reveal people's personalities. And people don't need to agree or have the same tastes or experiences to answer. Parker, author of the 2020 book  The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters ,  explains how to develop your own magical questions. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Priya, what are some of the qualities of a magical question?  They help people feel like not just a blob, but a group of individuals. And they help you know something about somebody. One of my favorite magical questions is: What was the first concert you went to, and who took you? I often ask this in team [meetings] or large town halls. Immediately, you get answers like Toni Braxton, Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, New Kids on the Block. So you might think: \"They went to the same concert I went to, how bad can they be?\" They can also be a jumping off point for other types of conversations, you say.  [Let's say you ask]: What's a gift you got that you deeply loved? That is a question that leads to other deeper questions, for example: What's a good gift? What creates meaning? Is it specificity? Empathy? What does it mean to be a generous person? How can we come up with our own magical questions?  Ask yourself: What questions might  everyone  be able to answer that come from the context of the group? That everyone is going to lean in and wait for the answer, but also be excited to share their own? Recently, someone on my Instagram shared that she discovered a magical question while she was in art class. People were talking about how quitting work was contagious. So she asked, \"What's everyone's favorite quitting story?\" Whether they were a musician, a consultant or a teacher, everyone had a story. [The question worked] because it was related to the conversation at hand. What's an example of a not-so-great magical question?  Years ago, when my son was 7 years old, he asked [our family]: What is your favorite animal? Now, that may be a magical question for  him , but not so interesting for the rest of us to either listen to or answer. You have a prompt to help people practice coming up with magical questions.  Imagine you are speaking to a group of dentists. What is the opening question you'd ask them? What was your favorite toothpaste flavor as a kid? Or maybe I'd ask if they expect me to answer their questions when they have their hands in my mouth!  I love it. Your first question is relatively equalizing. Every single dentist was once a child themselves. Some other questions you might ask: What is a Halloween candy you love that you would never recommend to your patients? What's the worst thing that's been said to you while someone was in the dental chair? Who has your favorite smile and why? What's the going rate for the tooth fairy? It sounds like what's required is attunement and presence. Speaking of which, what's the best way to bring up a magical question in conversation?  In some friend groups or group chats, you can be like, \"Y'all, I heard about this amazing thing called 'magical questions.' Are you game?\" Like, yes! In other places, some people are deeply allergic   to anything that feels like an icebreaker. As in all of life, read the room. More magical questions from Priya Parker  What's a gift someone gave you that offended you? What is one rule you had growing up that looking back now ,  you think was totally unnecessary or even a little funny? What are three gifts you would give aliens on behalf of humanity? When was the last time you used glitter? When was the last time you blew up a balloon with your own mouth? What is a favorite building in your community? When did it become so?

Sittenfeld. The pardons are widely seen as politically motivated, with recipients often being supporters or individuals facing charges linked to the 2020 election dispute. Experts like Bernadette Meyler and Jeffrey Crouch argue that Trump has made clemency a political tool, using it to express loyalty to allies, challenge perceived politically motivated prosecutions, and signal ideological positions. Trump’s actions contrast with previous presidents who used clemency more selectively or for reconciliation, and his early and frequent use of pardons has sparked debate over fairness, transparency, and the integrity of the justice system. The article also highlights the role of celebrities, personal connections, and political messaging in shaping clemency outcomes, while noting that the formal petition process appears to be underutilized, raising concerns about who receives mercy and who is overlooked.","keyTakeAways":["President Trump pardoned multiple individuals accused of or convicted of crimes related to the 2020 election attempt to overturn results, including Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows.","Trump's clemency actions are increasingly politically motivated, with many recipients being political allies, supporters, or figures convicted of corruption, regardless of party affiliation.","The pardons and commutations are used as a political tool to express support for Trump's narratives, such as opposition to what he frames as politically motivated prosecutions.","Trump's second-term pardons differ from previous administrations by occurring earlier and more frequently, with significant political signaling rather than being limited to lame-duck periods.","Trump's actions have sparked debate over the impartiality of the clemency process, with critics arguing it undermines judicial fairness and weakens trust in the justice system.","The White House has defended the pardons as constitutional exercise of presidential power, contrasting them with President Biden’s use of the autopen, and framing Trump’s approach as more involved and transparent.","The clemency process under Trump is being questioned for its lack of transparency, with concerns that the formal petition system is underutilized or ignored, especially for individuals with no political connections.","Trump appointed Alice Johnson as 'pardon czar,' who previously received a pardon for a nonviolent drug offense after celebrity advocacy, highlighting the role of public visibility and advocacy in securing clemency."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Donald Trump","whatIsThisEntity":"U.S. President","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Trump is the central political figure whose pardoning decisions are the subject of the article, reflecting broader political and legal implications of executive power in U.S. governance."},{"name":"Rudy Giuliani","whatIsThisEntity":"Former White House aide","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Giuliani was pardoned for alleged involvement in efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, illustrating Trump's focus on political allies in clemency decisions."},{"name":"Mark Meadows","whatIsThisEntity":"Former White House Chief of Staff","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Meadows was pardoned as part of Trump’s broader effort to pardon figures linked to the 2020 election challenge, reinforcing the political nature of the pardons."},{"name":"George Santos","whatIsThisEntity":"Former U.S. Representative","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Santos, a Trump supporter, was commuted of prison sentence for wire fraud and identity theft, signaling a pattern of leniency toward political allies."},{"name":"Changpeng Zhao","whatIsThisEntity":"Former CEO of Binance","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Zhao, pardoned for money laundering, has ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, highlighting personal and economic connections in clemency decisions."},{"name":"Rod Blagojevich","whatIsThisEntity":"Former Illinois Governor","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"A Democrat who was pardoned by Trump, this shows that Trump's pardons extend beyond Republican allies to include politically opposed figures convicted of corruption."},{"name":"P.G.

It comes after recent clemency grants from Trump to former U.S. Rep. George Santos and an ex-CEO of a cryptocurrency exchange. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While former President Joe Biden still holds the record of 4,245 clemency actions, Trump's second-term pardons and commutations are notable for their political and personal connections to the president, says Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University. \"There's more of a sense of the insider pardon than we've seen previously,\" Meyler said. In mid-October, Trump  commuted the prison sentence  of Santos, the disgraced New York Republican who  pleaded guilty  to wire fraud and identity theft last year. Days later the president  handed a full and unconditional pardon  to Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Binance has ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, but Trump said in an interview with  60 Minutes  that he  does not know who Zhao is . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. presidents are given broad authority to nullify convictions or sentences for federal crimes without the involvement of Congress or the Supreme Court. The legal principle is a holdover from English law, in which  the king had  what was known as the \"prerogative of mercy\" as early as the seventh century. While Trump has granted clemency to a wide range of people convicted of federal crimes, from nonviolent drug offenders to white-collar criminals, his first term in office was also marked by several notable  pardons of political allies  and grants of clemency to people  whose cases were advocated for by celebrities  or friends. Both of those trends have been amplified during his second term, Meyler said. \"He's much more explicit about making political statements through the use of the pardon power,\" Meyler said of Trump's second-term pardons and commutations. She said that includes granting clemency for people who have supported his political career as well as public statements he's made about why a particular crime shouldn't be punished. Trump's pardons align with his politics … Trump is by no means the first president to show leniency to a political ally. President Bill Clinton  pardoned Mark Rich , a former hedge-fund manager whose ex-wife had donated  hundreds of thousands of dollars  to the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Presidential Library and Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign. And President George W. Bush  commuted the sentence  of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. During his first four years in office,  Trump pardoned  his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, commuted the sentence of his friend and political confidant Roger Stone and pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared. In his second term, Trump \"has taken the same norm-busting approach to pardons as he has in other areas,\" Jeffrey Crouch, a professor of American politics at American University, told NPR via email. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Crouch pointed to Trump's move on inauguration day this year to  pardon some 1,500 defendants  (and commute the sentences of several others) convicted of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, siege on the U.S. Capitol in support of Trump's effort to overturn his electoral loss the previous fall. For comparison, Trump granted a total of 238 acts of clemency in his first term,  according to the Pew Research Center . Crouch said many presidents have waited until the \"lame duck\" period at the end of their terms to issue potentially controversial clemency grants — but not Trump. \"He did not shy away from granting early or controversial pardons and commutations in his first term, either.\" Politics have always been entwined with the U.S. clemency process, but past presidents have often used pardons as a way  to heal political divisions . George Washington pardoned some of those involved in the Whiskey Rebellion, while Jimmy Carter granted a blanket pardon to people who had evaded service  in the Vietnam War . The Trump administration has used clemency to benefit some of its political backers. In May, Trump pardoned  former Virginia Sheriff Scott Jenkins , an ardent Trump supporter who was convicted of taking bribes from local businessmen in exchange for auxiliary deputy badges. The day the pardon was announced, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin  posted on X : \"No MAGA left behind.\" And when Trump pardoned Santos earlier this month, the president  said on social media  that Santos had \"the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" The founders envisioned impeachment as one check on what is otherwise a nearly absolute presidential power, but Trump has  faced virtually no criticism from fellow Republicans  for his pardons and commutations. Past presidents have also taken flak from voters for their clemency decisions. Gerald Ford's approval rating  fell by more than 20 points  after he pardoned Richard Nixon in 1974, and he lost the presidential election two years later to Carter. … and his political frustrations While Santos and Jenkins are both Trump supporters, they also fall into another category of criminal that comes up with some regularity in Trump's clemency choices: public officials of both parties convicted of corruption. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump in February  issued a full pardon  for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, after having commuted Blagojevich's prison sentence during his first term as president. Former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld  received his own pardon  in May following his conviction on federal bribery and attempted extortion charges in 2022. Both men are Democrats. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  said in June  that Trump had pardoned a total of 16 former elected officials convicted of corruption charges. Meyler, the Stanford professor, said Trump, who has characterized  his own recent prosecutions  as politically motivated, may view the cases of political corruption against other politicians as similarly unjust. \"Maybe it's not too much of a stretch to think that Trump feels that he was prosecuted for similar kinds of offenses and then is kind of looking out at the landscape of political figures who have been prosecuted and, you know, potentially identifies with the plight of some of them,\" she said. In an emailed statement to NPR, the White House contrasted Trump's approach to the clemency process with former President Joe Biden's, alluding to criticism from Trump and his allies over Biden's use of an autopen to issue pardons and sign other official documents. (In June, Trump  ordered an investigation  into Biden's use of the autopen.) \"It's not difficult to be more involved in the pardon process when your predecessor was an autopen,\" said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. \"President Trump has exercised his constitutional authority to issue pardons and commutations for a variety of individuals.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Jackson also alluded to the lame-duck pardon Biden granted to his son Hunter, as well as Biden's  commutations of 37 federal death row prisoners . Biden said he made those commutations due to his objections to capital punishment at the federal level — and his worry that Trump would lift the moratorium he put on federal executions. \"And the only pardons anyone should be critical of are from President Autopen, who pardoned and commuted sentences of violent criminals including child killers and mass murderers – and that's not to mention the proactive pardons he 'signed' for his family members like Hunter on his way out the door,\" Jackson added. What is the clemency process under Trump? Getting his ear may help Though it's not the only path to securing a pardon or commutation, the official process for seeking clemency is to submit a formal application to the U.S. pardon attorney. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Martin, the current pardon attorney, was appointed by Trump after the president  withdrew his nomination  to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in the face of Republican opposition. The  Trump administration fired  the former pardon attorney, Liz Oyer, in March after she refused to restore the gun rights of actor and Trump supporter Mel Gibson, who had been convicted of domestic violence. Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas, said it's unclear whether the formal process is currently resulting in clemency grants in any significant numbers. \"Right now we know that there's still a mailbox, and that there are petitions going into that mailbox,\" he said. \"What we don't know is what happens after that.\" Osler said concerns about the clemency application process — or lack thereof — predated Trump's second term. He said Biden also issued pardons to political allies and personal connections he thought Trump may target,  including his son Hunter . \"So those norms were being strained and broken before Trump took office, but he certainly has continued that trend,\" he said. Osler, who runs a clinic where he and his students file petitions for people seeking clemency, said it's raising questions among those seeking clemency about their odds of success by following the traditional path to obtain a pardon or commutation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think people are focusing very much on how upset they are about who's receiving grants,\" he said. \"But we need to focus as well on who's not getting grants — those people who have done a long term in prison, who have rehabilitated themselves, often done incredible things in prison. And they're being ignored in their plea for mercy.\" Trump  appointed Alice Johnson  as his \"pardon czar\" in February. Johnson was pardoned for a nonviolent drug offense by Trump during his first term after her story got the attention and advocacy of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian. Johnson said she was going to \"fight for those who are still incarcerated, who don't have a voice like I have right now.\" She  told Fox News  in May that she'd sent more than 100 clemency petitions to the White House and \"over 46 people really were able to get a second chance in life.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5602065","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"People want to avoid ultra-processed foods. But experts struggle to define them","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Public health experts and policymakers are grappling with the issue of ultra-processed foods in the American diet, which are linked to rising rates of chronic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and depression. While the Brazilian-developed NOVA classification system provides a framework for identifying these foods — defined by high levels of processing and additives — experts disagree on whether all such foods are unhealthy. Some, like whole grain breads and certain yogurts, show health benefits, while others, such as processed meats and sugary beverages, are strongly tied to harm. Critics like Dr. David Ludwig argue that focusing on processing is misleading and instead propose targeting harmful nutrients like added sugars and refined grains.

But experts struggle to define them \n         By Maria Godoy \n        \n           Monday, November 10, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The American  diet is killing us . On that point, public health experts largely agree. And in recent years, people who want to make Americans healthier — across the ideological spectrum — are targeting ultra-processed foods, which make up the  majority of what Americans eat . Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said these foods are \" poisoning \" Americans and blames them for the chronic disease epidemic. California last month became the first U.S. state to  ban certain ultra-processed foods  from school lunches. And the Trump administration is working on its own  definition of ultra-processed foods  to help guide federal policy — and consumers. One  recent survey  found the majority of U.S. shoppers say they're trying to avoid these foods. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But here's the dilemma: Public health and nutrition experts don't agree on a definition of ultra-processed foods that will actually help make Americans healthier. 'They're not all junk foods' The term ultra-processed food was developed by Brazilian researchers to describe the level of processing foods undergo. They came up with the  NOVA classification system . On one end of the spectrum, there's unprocessed or minimally processed foods — such as an apple or frozen peas. On the other end, there's ultra-processed foods, which are made from manufactured ingredients and contain additives like artificial colors, flavors, emulsifiers and preservatives. Think processed deli meats, packaged cookies and candies, sweetened beverages and frozen ready meals. \"It's about additives and processing methods that aren't used in home cooking,\" says  Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian , head of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University. He says nearly 100 observational studies and three different randomized controlled trials have linked overconsumption of ultra-processed foods to a host of health harms — including an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, obesity,  cardiovascular disease ,  certain cancers  and even  depression. But not all foods that fit the definition of ultra-processed are unhealthy, says  Julia Wolfson , an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       For instance, packaged whole grain breads, plant-based milks and some yogurts are considered ultra-processed, but they can be beneficial for health. One study noted that yogurts were linked to a  lower risk of colorectal cancer , even if they had added sugar. Other studies have found  ultra-processed whole grain breads  are linked to a lower risk of  Type 2 diabetes  and  cardiovascular disease . And some of these foods can save time and money when cooking at home, such as jarred pasta sauce. \"They're not all junk foods,\" Wolfson says, so any health policy or regulation shouldn't treat them all the same. \"I think it's important to identify foods that are of most concern for health, and not just treat all ultra-processed foods with the same broad brush.\" But which foods do you focus on? That's a big point of contention. Should we target the nutrients? On one side of the debate you have people like  Dr. David Ludwig , a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center Boston Children's Hospital. He thinks the focus should be   on the overall nutritional quality of foods, not the processing. He argues that the concept of ultra-processed foods is too imprecise and can stigmatize healthy food while giving unhealthy food a false health halo. For example, he says, a low-sugar packaged cereal with added protein would be considered ultra-processed, but plain cornflakes are considered minimally processed — even if you pour a bunch of sugar on top at home. He says he'd much rather see kids eating the former breakfast. The same thing goes with additives. While some additives, such as emulsifiers, have been linked to disruptions in the gut microbiome, others, such as added dietary fiber, are helpful or benign, Ludwig says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"There are healthful ultra-processed foods and then there are unhealthy ultra-processed foods,\" Ludwig says. If the category is so diverse, \"what's the purpose of the concept in the first place?\" He worries that by targeting this one food category, we could end up with something similar to the  'fat-free' era of the 1980s and '90s . That resulted in a surge of low-fat, high-carb packaged snack foods, which were often loaded with sugar. Instead of focusing on ultra-processed foods,  he says it makes more sense  to target nutrients of concern with decades of evidence of harm. Chief among them are highly processed carbohydrates such as added sugars and refined grains like white rice, he says. The Institute of Food Technologists, which represents food scientists around the globe, has endorsed a similar approach. In comments submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture,  IFT called for a definition  that focuses on the nutritional quality of food — such as whether foods are high in salt, sugar and fat — not on the degree of processing. But can you really ignore the processing? Any definition that ignores the role of processing is missing the big picture, says Mozaffarian of Tufts University. While ultra-processed foods do tend to be high in salt, sugar and refined starches, \"that's not the whole story.\" He says,\"there's something about the processing itself that's important.\" High levels of processing alter the physical and chemical structure of foods in ways that change how our bodies digest them, Mozaffarian says. \"We have now molecularly disassembled and reassembled foods in a way that's never been done before in human history.\" Think cheese puffs, which are pretty unrecognizable from the corn meal they start with. \"When you lose natural, intact structure, you get  very, very rapid digestion  of the food in the stomach and small intestine,\" Mozaffarian says. \"So you get bursts of sugar and highly processed starch in your bloodstream.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Over time, these sugar spikes increase the risk of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, the rapid digestion of food means fewer nutrients reach your lower intestine, where the vast majority of our gut microbes live. So you end up starving your gut microbiome. And that's  not good for health  because gut microbes break down food that your body can't digest and in turn, they produce chemical messengers that influence everything from your   blood sugar levels  to your immune system. And evidence suggests our bodies  absorb more calories  from ultra-processed foods than they do from high-fiber whole foods. Mozaffarian says more research is needed to work out the exact mechanisms linking ultra-processed foods to health harms, but he thinks \"we know enough to start taking action.\" So what's a consumer to do? For now, there's no avoiding the fact that the majority of the foods sold in grocery stores are ultra-processed, says Wolfson of Johns Hopkins. And for many people, these foods are often the more affordable and accessible option. If the Trump administration truly wants to help Americans become healthier again, Wolfson says it also needs to adopt policies that help people afford healthier options. In the meantime, she says there are ways to make smarter choices within the ultra-processed category. For example, when shopping for packaged breads, look for whole grain options. And try to reduce consumption of sugar and artificially sweetened beverages and processed meats, two food categories that are  most strongly linked to health harms . And she says, get in the habit of reading ingredient lists. If it's really long and full of emulsifiers, dyes, and colorings, try to find an alternative product \"with the fewest of those ingredients that you don't know and can't pronounce.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       You might not always find an option that's not ultra-processed but you can \"try to maximize the nutrition and minimize the processed ingredients,\" she says. \"It's a tradeoff.\" Eat as many whole foods as you can. Beans, frozen fruits and vegetables are often more affordable options. Ultimately, though, \"If all the experts are disagreeing right now about exactly what to do, imagine what it's like for the average consumer?\" Mozaffarian says. That's why he  wants to see federal policy  to provide guidance. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5603609","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"13:58:00-05:00","title":"BBC Director Resigns After Criticism of Trump Speech Editing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"BBC Director-General Tim Davie and News CEO Deborah Turness resigned following intense public criticism over the editing of a January 6, 2021, speech by U.S. President Donald Trump, where a key segment advocating peaceful protest was allegedly removed.

The BBC said Director-General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness had both decided to leave the corporation. Britain's public broadcaster has been criticized for editing a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, before protesters attacked the Capitol in Washington. Critics said that the way the speech was edited for a BBC documentary last year was misleading and cut out a section where Trump said that he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. In a letter to staff, Davie said quitting the job after five years \"is entirely my decision.\" \"Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said. He said that he was \"working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.\" Turness said that the controversy about the Trump documentary \"has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC — an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\" \"In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down,\" she said in a note to staff. \"While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.\" Pressure on the broadcaster's top executives has been growing since the Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier complied by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines. As well as the Trump edit, it criticized the BBC's coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC's Arabic service. The BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters — and criticism from its commercial rivals — because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households with a television. It also is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial in its output, and critics are quick to point out when they think it has failed. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/box-office-predator-badlands-cdf57703df0ebb3e72a0309893cf5f6f","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:23:57+00:00","title":"Predator: Badlands Tops Box Office with $40 Million Debut","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Predator: Badlands premiered with a strong $40 million domestic opening, becoming the highest-grossing debut in the Predator franchise and marking a significant turnaround for Walt Disney Co. after a streak of disappointing film releases.

Sunday, a better-than-expected result that slightly lifted the box office from its autumn doldrums. On the heels of the worst box office weekend of 2025, “Predator: Badlands” faced little competition from new titles. Not accounting for inflation, the $40 million opening marked a new high for the dreadlocked alien franchise, besting the $38.3 million launch of 2004’s “Alien vs. Predator.” “Predator: Badlands,” written and directed by Dan Trachtenberg, collected another $40 million overseas for the Walt Disney Co.’s 20th Century Studios. A key factor for “Predator: Badlands” is that, with a budget of $105 million, it’s also the most expensive “Predator” film. “Badlands,” the eighth movie in the franchise that began with 1987’s “Predator,” offers a novel twist for the sci-fi series. On a remote planet, a young, outcast predator (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) encounters an android researcher (Elle Fanning), and the two set off on a journey. Reviews (85% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) have been good. Moviegoers gave it an “A-” CinemaScore. Good news had lately been hard to find in movie theaters. On Wednesday, AMC Theaters, the largest theater chain, posted a $298.2 million quarterly loss, partly due to a less-than-stellar summer season. But the fall has been worse. Last month was the lowest-grossing October in nearly three decades. Few awards hopefuls have made much of a mark.

But despite plenty of star power, most fell flat. “Die My Love,” starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, launched with $2.8 million from 1,983 theaters. The film, directed by Lynne Ramsay, stars Lawrence as a new mother and Pattinson as her husband. Mubi plunked down a reported $24 million for “Die My Love” after its debut at the Cannes Film Festival . Audience slammed it with a “D+” CinemaScore. “Christy,” starring Sydney Sweeney as the professional boxer Christy Martin, debuted with $1.3 million in 2,011 theaters. The film, the first one distributed by production company Black Bear Pictures, has earned Sweeney awards buzz since its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Sony Pictures Classics’ “Nuremberg,” a post-World War II drama about the Nuremberg trials starring Rami Malek and Russell Crowe, managed to do a bit better. It opened with $4.1 million in 1,802 theaters. It was slightly edged by the best performer of the newcomers: “Sarah’s Oil.” The Amazon MGM release opened with $4.5 million from 2,410 locations. It stars Naya Desir-Johnson as a young Black girl in the early 1900s who learns that her Oklahoma land allotment is rich with oil. “Sarah’s Oil” scored a rare “A+” CinemaScore from ticket buyers. Arguably the most promising of the prospective awards movies to open in theaters over the weekend was Neon’s “Sentimental Value.” The film, a prize-winner at Cannes, directed by Norwegian-Danish filmmaker Joachim Trier, has been tabbed as a major Oscar contender this year. The family drama’s cast includes Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgård, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, and, in her second movie of the weekend, Elle Fanning. It opened in four theaters with $200,000, giving it a $50,000 per-screen average. That’s the third best of the year. The debut of “Predator: Badlands” sealed the Walt Disney Co.’s fourth straight year of $4 billion in worldwide ticket sales. It also broke a short streak of disappointments for the studio, including “Tron: Ares” and “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” With potentially two of the biggest box-office hits of the year still to come in “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” Disney is poised to surpass $5 billion.

 \n      \n\n         A single infusion of an experimental gene-editing drug appears safe and effective for cutting cholesterol, possibly for life, according to a small early study released Saturday. The study, which involved 15 volunteers, found one infusion of a drug that uses the CRISPR gene-editing technique could safely reduce cholesterol, as well as levels of harmful triglycerides, by about half. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Rather than a lifetime worth of medicine, we have the potential to give people a cure,\" said Dr.  Luke Laffin , a preventative cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic who helped conduct the study. \"It's very exciting.\" The results of the study were presented Saturday at the  American Heart Association's annual meeting  and published in  The New England Journal of Medicine . If confirmed by future research, the approach could provide a powerful new weapon to fight  heart disease , the nation's leading killer, freeing people from the need to take statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs every day. Laffin and others cautioned, however, that much more research is needed to confirm the findings and make sure the treatment would be safe and long-lasting. \"The idea of an inexpensive, one-and-done [treatment], so you don't have to take any of those drugs, right now that's an idea — a fantasy — because gene-editing is expensive, long-term safety is unclear,\" Dr.  Eric Topol , a cardiologist at Scripps Research in California who wasn't involved in the study. Other scientists agree. \"It's a step in the right direction,\" says Dr.  Kiran Musunuru , scientific director of the Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. He was not involved in the research either.  \"It could be a very important tool,\" he says. \"But to actually prove it's protective against cardiovascular disease you need to do more study.\" And, Musunuru and others note that the bar for safety would be higher to use gene-editing on patients who are otherwise healthy compared to those already suffering from serious illnesses. Doctors infuse the drug into patients' bloodstream so it can travel to the liver and disable a gene called ANGPTL3, which is involved in producing cholesterol and triglycerides.  \"It's a knockout of the gene. It cuts it. And after that, the gene no longer functions,\" said Dr.  Steven Nissen , another preventive cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic involved in the research. Samarth Kulkarni , chief executive officer at  CRISPR Therapeutics , which is developing the drug and sponsored the study, says the approach \"could potentially impact millions of people around the world.\" The findings are consistent with a  similar approach  being developed by another company,  Verve Therapeutics  in Boston. \"The fact that we now have more clinical data that there's a 'there there' is of course tremendously encouraging,\" says  Fyodor Urnov , who studies gene editing at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Having a CRISPR medicine for heart attack would be an extraordinary win.\" Neither company has said how much the treatment might cost, but other gene-editing and gene therapies have been very expensive, costing millions per patient. Millions of people take medicines every day to cut their cholesterol and their risk for having a heart attack or stroke. But heart disease still kills nearly 700,000 people every year in the US. One big reason: A lot of people quit taking their medicine. \"This problem of adherence — that people stop taking their medications — is huge,\" Nissen says. Researchers are planning larger, longer studies to see whether a one-time gene-editing drug could safely protect people against heart attacks and strokes for a lifetime. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:   Heart disease is the nation's leading killer, and there's tantalizing news out today about what could be a powerful new way to fight it. A single infusion of an experimental gene-editing drug appears safe and effective for cutting cholesterol, possibly for life. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the story. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Millions of people take medicines every day to cut their cholesterol and the risk of having a heart attack or stroke, but heart disease still kills nearly 700,000 people every year in the U.S. One big reason - a lot of people quit taking their medicine. Dr. Steven Nissen is a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. STEVEN NISSEN: This problem of adherence, that people stop taking their medications, is huge. STEIN: So Nissen and his colleagues infused 15 patients with an experimental drug that uses the gene-editing technique called CRISPR. This CRISPR drug homes in on a gene in the liver involved in making cholesterol, as well as dangerous triglycerides, and literally slices it. NISSEN: It's a knockout of the gene. It cuts it, and after that, the gene no longer functions. STEIN: And disabling the gene appears to work, safely reducing levels of cholesterol and triglycerides by as much as half for at least two months, suggesting the benefits may be permanent. LUKE LAFFIN: This is a big deal. Rather than a lifetime worth of medicine, we have the potential to give people a cure. STEIN: Dr. Luke Laffin worked with Nissen at the Cleveland Clinic. Their team presented the results at the American Heart Association's annual scientific meeting at the same time the details were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The results are similar to those announced previously by another team testing another potential one-and-done gene-editing drug to cut cholesterol. Fyodor Urnov studies gene editing at the University of California, Berkeley. FYODOR URNOV: The fact that we now have more clinical data that there is, quote, \"a there there,\" is, of course, tremendously encouraging. Having a CRISPR medicine for heart attack would be an extraordinary win. STEIN: But others urge caution, noting the studies so far have been very small and very short. Dr. Eric Topol is a cardiologist at Scripps Research in California. ERIC TOPOL: The idea of an inexpensive one-and-done so you don't have to take any of those drugs, right now, that's an idea - a fantasy - 'cause right now, genome editing is terribly expensive. The long-term safety is unclear. STEIN: So researchers are planning larger, longer studies to see whether a one-time gene-editing drug could safely protect people against heart attacks and strokes for a lifetime.

(AP) — The head of the BBC and the British broadcaster’s top news executive both resigned Sunday after criticism of the way the organization edited a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump. The BBC said Director-General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness had both decided to leave the corporation. Britain’s publicly funded national broadcaster has been criticized for editing a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, before protesters attacked the Capitol in Washington. Critics said the way the speech was edited for a BBC documentary last year was misleading and cut out a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. A clip of the BBC “Panorama” episode shared by The Daily Telegraph appears to show different parts of Trump’s speech edited into one quote. In the episode, Trump is shown saying: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.” According to video and a transcript from Trump’s comments that day , he said:  “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.

You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.” Nearly an hour later, Trump used the phrase “we fight like hell” toward the end of his speech, but without referencing the Capitol. “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said then. In a letter to staff, Davie said quitting the job after five years “is entirely my decision.” “Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,” Davie said. He said he was “working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.” Turness said the controversy about the Trump documentary “has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC — an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.” “In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down,” she said in a note to staff. “While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.” Trump posted a link to a Daily Telegraph story about the speech-editing on his Truth Social network, thanking the newspaper “for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.” He called that “a terrible thing for Democracy!” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reacted on X, posting a screen grab of an article headlined “Trump goes to war with ‘fake news’ BBC” beside another about Davie’s resignation, with the words “shot” and “chaser.” Pressure on the broadcaster’s top executives has been growing since the right-leaning Telegraph published parts of a dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines. As well as the Trump edit, it criticized the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. The 103-year-old BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters — and criticism from its commercial rivals — because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households with a television. The BBC airs vast reams of entertainment and sports programming across multiple television and radio stations and online platforms — but it’s the BBC’s news output that is most often under scrutiny. The broadcaster is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial, and critics are quick to point out when they think it has failed. It’s frequently a political football, with conservatives seeing a leftist slant in its news output and some liberals accusing it of having a conservative bias. It has also been criticized from all angles over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. In February, the BBC removed a documentary about Gaza from its streaming service after it emerged that the child narrator was the son of an official in the Hamas-led government. Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said the BBC was full of “institutional bias,” and “the new leadership must now deliver genuine reform of the culture of the BBC, top to bottom.” Lisa Nandy, the minister in charge of media in Britain’s center-left Labour government, thanked Davie for his work and said the government would help the BBC secure “its role at the heart of national life for decades to come. “Now more than ever, the need for trusted news and high quality programming is essential to our democratic and cultural life, and our place in the world,” Nandy said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/typhoon-fungwong-philippines-kalmaegi-evacuations-taiwan-027a3a79f6f99d46b373b8712e2b2087","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"01:30:09+00:00","title":"Typhoon Fung-wong Causes Widespread Damage in Northern Philippines, Displacing Over 1.4 Million","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known as Uwan in the Philippines, struck northern regions of the country on November 5, 2025, following the devastation from Typhoon Kalmaegi.

Typhoon Fung-wong blew out of the northwestern Philippines on Monday after setting off floods and landslides, knocking out power to entire provinces, killing at least eight people and displacing more than 1.4 million others. The typhoon was forecast to head northwest toward Taiwan. Fung-wong lashed the northern Philippines while the country was still dealing with the devastation wrought last week by Typhoon Kalmaegi , which left at least 224 people dead in central provinces on Nov. 4 before pummeling Vietnam, where at least five were killed. Fung-wong slammed ashore in northeastern Aurora province on Sunday night as a super typhoon with sustained winds of up to 185 kph (115 mph) and gusts of up to 230 kph (143 mph). The 1,800-kilometer (1,100-mile)-wide storm weakened as it raked through mountainous northern provinces and agricultural plains overnight before blowing away from the province of La Union into the South China Sea, according to state forecasters. One person drowned in flash floods in the eastern province of Catanduanes, and another died in Catbalogan city in eastern Samar province when her house collapsed on her, officials said.

Follow on Another landslide in Lubuagan town in nearby Kalinga province killed two villagers and two others were missing, provincial officials said late Monday. More than 1.4 million people moved into emergency shelters or the homes of relatives before the typhoon made landfall, and about 318,000 remained in evacuation centers on Monday. Fierce wind and rain flooded at least 132 northern villages, including one where some residents were trapped on their roofs as floodwaters rapidly rose. About 1,000 houses were damaged, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV of the Office of Civil Defense and other officials said, adding that roads blocked by landslides would be cleared as the weather improved on Monday. “While the typhoon has passed, its rains still pose a danger in certain areas” in northern Luzon, including in metropolitan Manila,” Alejandro said. “We’ll undertake today rescue, relief and disaster-response operations.” Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared a state of emergency on Thursday due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected damage from Fung-wong, which was also called Uwan in the Philippines. Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 185 kph (115 mph) or higher are categorized in the Philippines as a super typhoon to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather disturbances. The Philippines has not called for international help following the devastation caused by Kalmaegi, but Teodoro said the United States, the country’s longtime treaty ally, and Japan were ready to provide assistance. Authorities announced that schools and most government offices would be closed on Monday and Tuesday. More than 325 domestic and 61 international flights were canceled over the weekend and into Monday, and more than 6,600 commuters and cargo workers were stranded in ports after the coast guard prohibited ships from venturing into rough seas. The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. The country also has frequent earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes , making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/climate-brazil-trump-disasters-cooperation-cop30-ae09566d32a8a97a954b2cef831de503","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:07:28+00:00","title":"COP30 Climate Summit Begins in Belem, Brazil Amid U.S. Absence and Climate Crisis Urgency","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The COP30 U.N.

But top U.S. negotiators were absent. Negotiators can’t forget that “the climate emergency is an increase of inequality,” host President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told them. He said he picked the host city of Belem instead of “a finished city” to drive home the impact that warming has on the Amazon and on poverty. “The increase of the global temperature is spreading pain and devastation especially amongst the most vulnerable populations,” he told the conference known as COP30. This year’s talks aren’t expected to end with any ambitious new deal. Instead, organizers and analysts frame this year’s conference as the “implementation COP.” Countries had homework : Show up with their updated national plans to fight climate change. Attendees on Monday stressed cooperation. Individual nations can’t cut emissions of heat-trapping gases fast enough, said U.N. climate secretary Simon Stiell.

The world has seen faster climate change than expected since the Paris Agreement a decade ago. This issue will be a focus of this week’s UN climate talks in Brazil. (Produced by Julián Trejo Bax) André Corrêa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, emphasized that negotiators must engage in “mutirão,” derived from a local Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting for a task. Complicating those calls is the United States, where President Donald Trump has long denied the existence of climate change. His administration did not send high-level negotiators and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement , the first global pact to fight climate change. The Paris Agreement was supposed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the historical average, but many scientists now say it’s unlikely countries will stay below that threshold. The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S. Brazil’s president railed against climate misinformation without mentioning absent Americans by name. “COP30 will be the COP of truth,” Lula said. “They attack institutions, they attack science and universities. Now it’s the moment to impose a new defeat to the denialists.” Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva speaks during a plenary session at the COP30 U.N.

Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said. “It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” he said. Though the U.S. government isn’t showing up, some attendees including former top U.S. negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will help take up the slack. Lula and Stiell said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree , but action needs to be accelerated. They pointed to devastation in the past few weeks including Hurricane Melissa in the Caribbean, typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines and a tornado ripping through southern Brazil. Scientists have said extreme weather events have become more frequent as Earth warms. “Climate change is not a threat of the future. It is already a tragedy of the present time,’’ Lula said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

with taking bribes to rig pitches \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Sunday, November 9, 2025 • 6:23 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NEW YORK — Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz have been indicted on charges they took bribes from sports bettors to throw certain types of pitches, including tossing balls in the dirt instead of strikes, to ensure successful bets. According to the indictment unsealed Sunday in federal court in Brooklyn, the highly-paid hurlers took several thousand dollars in payoffs to help two unnamed gamblers from their native Dominican Republic win at least $460,000 on in-game prop bets on the speed and outcome of certain pitches. Clase, the Guardians' former closer, and Ortiz, a starter, have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July, when Major League Baseball started investigating what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched. Some of the games in question were in April, May and June. Ortiz, 26, was arrested Sunday by the FBI at Boston Logan International Airport. He is expected to appear in federal court in Boston on Monday. Clase, 27, was not in custody, officials said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Ortiz and Clase \"betrayed America's pastime,\" U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. said. \"Integrity, honesty and fair play are part of the DNA of professional sports. When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us.\" Ortiz's lawyer, Chris Georgalis, said in a statement that his client was innocent and \"has never, and would never, improperly influence a game — not for anyone and not for anything.\" Georgalis said Ortiz's defense team had previously documented for prosecutors that the payments and money transfers between him and individuals in the Dominican Republic were for lawful activities. \"There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning. Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court,\" Georgalis said. A lawyer for Clase did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The Major League Baseball Players Association had no comment. Unusual betting activity prompted investigation Major League Baseball said it contacted federal law enforcement when it began investigating unusual betting activity and \"has fully cooperated\" with authorities. \"We are aware of the indictment and today's arrest, and our investigation is ongoing,\" a league statement said. In a statement, the Guardians said: \"We are aware of the recent law enforcement action. We will continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Clase and Ortiz are both charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery. The top charges carry a potential punishment of up to 20 years in prison. In one example cited in the indictment, Clase allegedly invited a bettor to a game against the Boston Red Sox in April and spoke with him by phone just before taking the mound. Four minutes later, the indictment said, the bettor and his associates won $11,000 on a wager that Clase would toss a certain pitch slower than 97.95 mph (157.63 kph). In May, the indictment said, Clase agreed to throw a ball at a certain point in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, but the batter swung, resulting in a strike, costing the bettors $4,000 in wagers. After the game, which the Guardians won, Clase sent text messages to one of the bettors with images of a man hanging himself with toilet paper and a sad puppy dog face, the indictment said. Clase, a three-time All-Star and two-time American League Reliever of the Year, had a $4.5 million salary in 2025, the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract. The three-time AL save leader began providing the bettors with information about his pitches in 2023 but didn't ask for payoffs until this year, prosecutors said. The indictment cited specific pitches Clase allegedly rigged — all of them first pitches when he entered to start an inning: a 98.5 mph (158.5 kph) cutter low and inside to the New York Mets' Starling Marte on May 19, 2023; an 89.4 mph (143.8 kph) slider to Minnesota's Ryan Jeffers that bounced well short of home plate on June 3, 2023; an 89.4 mph (143.8 kph) slider to Kansas City's Bobby Witt Jr. that bounced on April 12; a 99.1 mph (159.5 kph) cutter in the dirt to Philadelphia's Max Kepler on May 11; a bounced 89.1 mph (143.4) slider to Milwaukee's Jake Bauers on May 13; and a bounced 87.5 mph (140.8 kph) slider to Cincinnati's Santiago Espinal on May 17. Prosecutors said Ortiz, who had a $782,600 salary this year, got in on the scheme in June and is accused of rigging pitches in games against the Seattle Mariners and the St. Louis Cardinals. Ortiz was cited for bouncing a first-pitch 86.7 mph (139.5 kph) slider to Seattle's Randy Arozarena starting the second inning on June 15 and bouncing a first-pitch 86.7 mph (139.5 kph) slider to St. Louis' Pedro Pagés that went to the backstop opening the third inning on June 27. Dozens of pro athletes have been charged in gambling sweeps The charges are the latest bombshell developments in a federal crackdown on betting in professional sports. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Last month, more than 30 people, including prominent basketball figures such as Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, were arrested in a gambling sweep that rocked the NBA. Sports betting scandals have long been a concern, but a May 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling led to a wave of gambling incidents involving athletes and officials. The ruling struck down a federal ban on sports betting in most states and opened the doors for online sportsbooks to take a prominent space in the sports ecosystem.

The justices, without comment, turned away an appeal from Kim Davis , the former Kentucky court clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the high court’s 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. Davis had been trying to get the court to overturn a lower-court order for her to pay $360,000 in damages and attorney’s fees to a couple denied a marriage license. Her lawyers repeatedly invoked the words of Justice Clarence Thomas, who alone among the nine justices has called for erasing the same-sex marriage ruling. Thomas was among four dissenting justices in 2015. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito are the other dissenters who are on the court today. Roberts has been silent on the subject since he wrote a dissenting opinion in the case. Alito has continued to criticize the decision, but he said recently he was not advocating that it be overturned. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was not on the court in 2015, has said that there are times when the court should correct mistakes and overturn decisions, as it did in the 2022 case that ended a constitutional right to abortion .

Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson praised the justices’ decision not to intervene. “The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences,” Robinson said in a statement. Davis drew national attention to eastern Kentucky’s Rowan County when she turned away same-sex couples, saying her faith prevented her from complying with the high court ruling. She defied court orders to issue the licenses until a federal judge jailed her for contempt of court in September 2015. She was released after her staff issued the licenses on her behalf but removed her name from the form. The Kentucky legislature later enacted a law removing the names of all county clerks from state marriage licenses. Davis lost a reelection bid in 2018. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court ."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-ai-earnings-trump-f2bee27796f9401e5cd8d88c06785f93","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:38:57+00:00","title":"U.S. Markets Rally Amid AI Stock Gains and Government Shutdown Concerns","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Monday, U.S. stock markets rallied, with the S&P 500 rising 0.8% and the Nasdaq jumping 1.4%, driven primarily by gains in artificial intelligence-focused companies like Nvidia and Palantir.

Monday, helping Wall Street recover some of its loss from last week . The S&P 500 rose 0.8% to claw back close to half its drop from last week, which was its first weekly loss in four. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged behind. The Dow, which has less of an emphasis on technology stocks, was down 8 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. Nvidia was by far the strongest force pushing the market upward and rose 3.3%. It and other winners in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology had been at the center of last week’s drop. Critics say their stock prices shot too high and too fast in the mania around AI , drawing comparisons to the 2000 dot-com bubble that ultimately burst. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for Nvidia and other companies, saw its stock that trades in United States rise 2.4% after saying its revenue climbed nearly 17% in October from a year earlier. While such growth is strong compared with other companies, it’s a slowdown from TSMC’s earlier performance. Another AI darling, Palantir Technologies, jumped 6.6% for one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500. Related Stories These 8 Democrats voted with Republicans on the government shutdown deal.

Health care companies fell as uncertainty remains about whether Washington will extend expiring health care tax credits, a sticking point on Capitol Hill that’s created the longest-ever shutdown for the U.S. government. That’s even though the Senate took the first steps on Sunday to end the shutdown. President Donald Trump suggested in a social media post over the weekend that cash being sent to “money sucking” insurance companies should instead go directly to people so they can buy their own health insurance. Humana fell 4%, and Centene dropped 9.9%. The effects of the government’s shutdown have become more apparent following the cancellations of thousands of flights over the weekend. Towers are facing shortages as some air traffic controllers — unpaid for weeks — have stopped showing up for work. Besides the pain at airports, the U.S. government’s shutdown has also delayed important reports on the economy. A resumption could upset financial markets if the released logjam shows data that dashes traders’ expectations for coming cuts to interest rates. The wide expectation is that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut its main interest rate in hopes of shoring up what has been a slowing job market . Wall Street loves lower interest rates because they can give the economy a boost while also pushing prices for investments upward. But the Fed has said it may have to halt its cuts if inflation worsens because lower interest rates can give inflation more fuel. Without updates from the U.S. government on jobs and the economy, traders have instead been trawling profit reports from companies for clues about how things are going. Tyson Foods, which sells chicken and other meat, climbed 1.3% after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It benefited from increases in prices for its pork and beef of 11% to 17%. Roughly four out of every five companies in the S&P 500 have also been reporting stronger profits for the summer than analysts expected, according to FactSet. Companies usually top analysts’ profit expectations each quarter, but the pressure was high this time around because they needed to justify the big moves upward for their stock prices since April. Delivering bigger profits is one of the easier ways companies can quiet criticism that their stock prices have become too expensive. Companies have also been giving generally strong forecasts for upcoming results, according to Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian. That has analysts’ expectations for earnings in 2026 nearly all the way back to where they were before Trump shocked the economy and financial markets with his “Liberation Day” announcement of worldwide tariffs in April. In stock markets abroad, indexes rallied across much of Europe and Asia. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 3% for one of the bigger gains. Chip company SK Hynix, which is cooperating with Nvidia on artificial intelligence, leaped 4.5%. Its bigger rival, Samsung Electronics, climbed 2.8%. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.10% from 4.11% late Friday. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/winter-weather-snow-chicago-great-lakes-storm-34919c171b8ecebcad4ecab6708c0712","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:00:23+00:00","title":"U.S. Prepares for Severe Winter Storm with Heavy Snow and Cold Temperatures","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major winter storm swept across the U.S. on November 9, 2025, bringing heavy snowfall, dangerous travel conditions, and extreme cold to large portions of the Midwest and South.

Meteorologists said conditions for road travel in northeast Illinois would be “dangerous to impossible” from snow accumulating faster than 3 inches (8 centimeters) per hour. As temperatures dropped across the nation’s midsection, meteorologists warned of hazardous travel conditions through winter weather advisories for Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin. Snow fell Sunday in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, where meteorologists warned of low visibility with up to a foot by Monday. In Indiana, weather experts predicted up to 11 inches (28 centimeters) of snow and “slippery surfaces” for road travel. Up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of snow were predicted in parts of Wisconsin.

2025-11-09T16:33:10+00:00\n\nBERLIN (AP) — Indianapolis Colts cornerback Sauce Gardner was thinking about a pick-6. It would have been quite a debut with his new team. He jumped a route but Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr.'s pass intended for Drake London went through Gardner’s hands, hit his midsection and bounced incomplete. “I was trying to score, so I was already looking at the end zone,” Gardner said. Still, the Colts left Berlin with a 31-25 overtime victory over Indianapolis that will soothe Gardner’s disappointment. The Colts were trailing 17-13 at the time, on a third-and-8 with just under 10 minutes to go in the third quarter. “That’s one I’ve got to have and that’s one that I will have next time,” he said. It’s the type of play the Colts were hoping for when they traded two first-round draft picks and receiver Adonai Mitchell to the New York Jets on Tuesday to get one of the league’s premier cover cornerbacks . Gardner also had one-on-one coverage on London when Penix connected with the receiver for a 2-point conversion and a 25-22 lead with 1:44 left in regulation after Tyler Allgeier’s second touchdown of the game.

Colts kicker Michael Badgley then tied the game with a 44-yard field goal with 25 seconds left. “That was supposed to be the game winner right there, not just to tie the game up. So I made sure I’m not going to slip no more, and coverage got real sticky for us to get the ball back to our offense,” he said. Colts cornerback Kenny Moore II was impressed by his new teammate. “He just elevated the entire room. It’s impressive how he was able to adjust to everything that we had going into the game plan,” Moore said. “We didn’t slow up at all trying to communicate. We didn’t slow up at all getting the checks in the game.” It’s been a whirlwind week for Gardner, the No. 4 overall selection in the 2022 draft. For the upcoming bye week, he’ll be thinking about more than Xs and Os. “About 99 percent of my clothes are in Jersey still, so I’ve definitely got to make something happen with that because I’m not trying to be wearing the same stuff,” he said. “Definitely getting my clothes back to Indy, but I’m excited for this plane ride that we’re about to be on. “That was the first time that I’ve been in a locker room that electric this year after a game because that was my first win I’ve been a part of this year.

government shutdown on Sunday after a group of moderate Democrats agreed to proceed without a guaranteed extension of health care subsidies, angering many in their caucus who say Americans want them to continue the fight. In a test vote that is the first in a series of required procedural maneuvers, the Senate voted 60-40 to move toward passing compromise legislation to fund the government and hold a later vote on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire Jan. 1. Final passage could be several days away if Democrats object and delay the process. The Senate took the first step to end the government shutdown on Sunday after a group of moderate Democrats agreed to proceed without a guaranteed extension of health care subsidies, angering many in their caucus who say Americans want them to continue the fight. The agreement does not guarantee the health care subsidies will be extended, as Democrats have demanded for almost six weeks. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York voted against moving ahead with the package, along with all but eight of his Democratic colleagues. A group of three former governors — New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine — broke the six-week stalemate on Sunday when they agreed to vote to advance three bipartisan annual spending bills and extend the rest of government funding until late January in exchange for a mid-December vote on extending the health care tax credits.

Returning to the White House on Sunday evening after attending a football game, President Donald Trump did not say whether he endorsed the deal. But he said, “It looks like we’re getting close to the shutdown ending.” Five Democrats switch votes In addition to Shaheen, King and Hassan, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, home to tens of thousands of federal workers, also voted in favor of moving forward on the agreement. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman and Nevada Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen also voted yes. The moderates had expected a larger number of Democrats to vote with them as 10-12 Democratic senators had been part of the negotiations. But in the end, only five Democrats switched their votes — the exact number that Republicans needed. King, Cortez Masto and Fetterman had already been voting to open the government since Oct. 1.

Schumer votes no After Democrats met for over two hours to discuss the proposal, Schumer said he could not “in good faith” support it. Schumer, who received blowback from his party in March when he voted to keep the government open, said that Democrats have now “sounded the alarm” on health care. “We will not give up the fight,” he said. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with the Democrats, said giving up the fight was a “horrific mistake.” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., agreed, saying that in last week’s elections people voted overwhelmingly Democratic “to urge Democrats to hold firm.” A bipartisan agreement Democrats had voted 14 times not to reopen the government as they demanded the extension of tax credits that make coverage more affordable under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans said they would not negotiate on health care, but GOP leaders have been quietly working with the group of moderates as the contours of an agreement began to emerge. The agreement includes bipartisan bills worked out by the Senate Appropriations Committee to fund parts of government — food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things. All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills. The deal would reinstate federal workers who had received reduction in force, or layoff, notices and reimburse states that spent their own funds to keep federal programs running during the shutdown. It would also protect against future reductions in force through January and guarantee federal workers would be paid once the shutdown is over.

Greg Casar, the chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said a deal that doesn’t reduce health care costs is a “betrayal” of millions of Americans who are counting on Democrats to fight. “Accepting nothing but a pinky promise from Republicans isn’t a compromise — it’s capitulation,” Casar said in a post on X. “Millions of families would pay the price.” Rep.

Health care debate ahead It’s unclear whether the two parties would be able to find any common ground on the health care subsidies before a promised December vote in the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he will not commit to bring it up in his chamber. Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19-era tax credits as premiums could skyrocket for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies and argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals. Other Republicans, including Trump, have used the debate to renew their yearslong criticism of the law and called for it to be scrapped or overhauled. Shutdown effects worsen Meanwhile, the consequences of the shutdown have been compounding. U.S. airlines canceled more than 2,000 flights on Sunday for the first time since the shutdown began, and there were more than 7,000 flight delays, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks air travel disruptions. Treasury Secretary Sean Duffy said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that air travel ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday will be “reduced to a trickle” if the government doesn’t reopen.

bettors to throw certain types of pitches, including tossing balls in the dirt instead of strikes, to ensure successful bets. According to the indictment unsealed Sunday in federal court in Brooklyn, the highly paid hurlers took several thousand dollars in payoffs to help two unnamed gamblers from their native Dominican Republic win at least $460,000 on in-game prop bets on the speed and outcome of certain pitches. Clase, the Guardians’ former closer, and Ortiz, a starter, have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July, when MLB started investigating what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched. Some of the games in question were in April, May and June. Ortiz, 26, was arrested Sunday by the FBI at Boston Logan International Airport. He is expected to appear in federal court in Boston on Monday. Clase, 27, was not in custody, officials said. Ortiz and Clase “betrayed America’s pastime,” U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. said. “Integrity, honesty and fair play are part of the DNA of professional sports. When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us.” Related Stories A closer look at the pitches by Clase, Ortiz cited in sporting gambling indictment 3 MIN READ Black Sox, Ohtani’s interpreter and more: A look at notable sports betting scandals 10 MIN READ Rob Manfred increasingly confident major leaguers will play in 2028 LA Olympics 4 MIN READ Ortiz’s lawyer, Chris Georgalis, said in a statement that his client was innocent and “has never, and would never, improperly influence a game — not for anyone and not for anything.” Georgalis said Ortiz’s defense team had previously documented for prosecutors that the payments and money transfers between him and individuals in the Dominican Republic were for lawful activities. “There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning. Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court,” Georgalis said. A lawyer for Clase, Michael J. Ferrara, said his client “has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win. Emmanuel is innocent of all charges and looks forward to clearing his name in court.” The Major League Baseball Players Association had no comment. Unusual betting activity prompted investigation MLB said it contacted federal law enforcement when it began investigating unusual betting activity and has fully cooperated with authorities. “We are aware of the indictment and today’s arrest, and our investigation is ongoing,” a league statement said. In a statement, the Guardians said: “We are aware of the recent law enforcement action. We will continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.” Clase and Ortiz are both charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery. The top charges carry a potential punishment of up to 20 years in prison. In one example cited in the indictment, Clase allegedly invited a bettor to a game against the Boston Red Sox in April and spoke with him by phone just before taking the mound. Four minutes later, the indictment said, the bettor and his associates won $11,000 on a wager that Clase would toss a certain pitch slower than 97.95 mph (157.63 kph). In May, the indictment said, Clase agreed to throw a ball at a certain point in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, but the batter swung, resulting in a strike, costing the bettors $4,000 in wagers. After the game, which the Guardians won, Clase sent text messages to one of the bettors with images of a man hanging himself with toilet paper and a sad puppy dog face, the indictment said. Clase, a three-time All-Star and two-time American League Reliever of the Year, had a $4.5 million salary in 2025, the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract . The three-time AL save leader began providing the bettors with information about his pitches in 2023 but didn’t ask for payoffs until this year, prosecutors said. The indictment cited specific pitches Clase allegedly rigged — all of them first pitches when he entered to start an inning: a 98.5 mph (158.5 kph) cutter low and inside to the New York Mets’ Starling Marte on May 19, 2023; an 89.4 mph (143.8 kph) slider to Minnesota’s Ryan Jeffers that bounced well short of home plate on June 3, 2023; an 89.4 mph (143.8 kph) slider to Kansas City’s Bobby Witt Jr. that bounced on April 12; a 99.1 mph (159.5 kph) cutter in the dirt to Philadelphia’s Max Kepler on May 11; a bounced 89.1 mph (143.4) slider to Milwaukee’s Jake Bauers on May 13; and a bounced 87.5 mph (140.8 kph) slider to Cincinnati’s Santiago Espinal on May 17. Prosecutors said Ortiz, who had a $782,600 salary this year, got in on the scheme in June and is accused of rigging pitches in games against the Seattle Mariners and the St. Louis Cardinals. Ortiz was cited for bouncing a first-pitch 86.7 mph (139.5 kph) slider to Seattle’s Randy Arozarena starting the second inning on June 15 and bouncing a first-pitch 86.7 mph (139.5 kph) slider to St. Louis’ Pedro Pagés that went to the backstop opening the third inning on June 27. Dozens of pro athletes have been charged in gambling sweeps The charges are the latest bombshell developments in a federal crackdown on betting in professional sports. Last month, more than 30 people, including prominent basketball figures such as Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier , were arrested in a gambling sweep that rocked the NBA. Sports betting scandals have long been a concern, but a May 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling led to a wave of gambling incidents involving athletes and officials. The ruling struck down a federal ban on sports betting in most states and opened the doors for online sportsbooks to take a prominent space in the sports ecosystem. Major League Baseball suspended five players in June 2024, including a lifetime ban for San Diego infielder Tucupita Marcano for allegedly placing 387 baseball bets with a legal sportsbook totaling more than $150,000. ___ Associated Press reporters Eric Tucker in Washington and Ron Blum in New York contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/explosion-near-red-fort-in-indias-new-delhi","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:46:11+00:00","title":"Police say at least eight killed in blast near Red Fort in India’s Delhi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At least eight people were killed and 20 injured in a car explosion near the Red Fort metro station in Delhi on November 10, 2025.

al-Sharaa on historic visit to US, here’s what you need to know\n\nSyrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa arrived in the United States on Saturday, ahead of a historic meeting with his US counterpart, Donald Trump.\n\nThis marks the first time a Syrian president has visited the White House in at least 80 years.\n\nThe meeting is of particular importance considering the US’s power in removing sanctions, something Syria badly needs to kick-start its economy.\n\nWhat will be on the agenda when the two leaders meet? Read on to find out.\n\nFor Syria, it is likely about making moves to finally repeal the Caesar Act, a series of sanctions the US applied to Syria in 2019, during the rule of former President Bashar al-Assad, who was overthrown by a lightning offensive led by al-Sharaa in December last year.\n\nWhile the Trump administration gave an  executive order to lift sanctions  on Syria, the US Congress has to vote to repeal the Caesar Act.\n\nUS sanctions on Syria date as far back as the late 1970s, though more were applied in 2004 and again in 2011.\n\nRepublican Congressman Brian Mast, who has previously  compared Palestinian civilians to Nazis , was reportedly an obstacle to the Caesar Act’s repeal.\n\nHowever, Mast reportedly met with the 43-year-old al-Sharaa in the early hours of Monday morning and had a “positive and constructive” meeting, Syrian journalist Fared al-Mahlool reported on his Instagram account.\n\nRemoving all the sanctions on Syria means the country can return to the global financial system, making investments and business smoother.\n\nIt will also help it rebuild its devastated healthcare system and infrastructure damaged during the 13-year civil war that broke out after Syria’s 2011 revolution and the al-Assad government’s heavy-handed response to it.\n\nAl-Sharaa is reportedly also seeking funds for Syrian reconstruction after the war.\n\nMany neighbourhoods were turned to dust and continue to sit in piles of rubble. The World Bank estimates the battered country needs at least $216bn to rebuild.\n\nFor the US, the trip has a different significance.\n\nWashington has high hopes it will convince Damascus to join its coalition against the armed group ISIL (ISIS).\n\nThe coalition is made up of 89 countries from across the world, and includes over a dozen Arab states.\n\nSyria’s joining the coalition will further signal its regional integration under the new administration led by al-Sharaa.\n\nTrump would also like to expand the Abraham Accords, a group of US-brokered normalisation deals between Israel and Arab states, by  adding Syria .\n\nArab media is reporting that Syria is likely to sign on to the fight against ISIL.\n\nAs al-Sharaa landed in Washington, Syria’s Ministry of Interior announced the launch of a “large-scale security operation”, carrying out 61 raids that targeted ISIL cells across the country.\n\nThe ministry said operations were carried out in Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, Homs and Damascus.\n\nEarlier this month, US envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said al-Sharaa would “hopefully” sign an agreement that would have Syria join the anti-ISIL coalition.\n\nNormalisation, however, may have to wait.\n\nIt’s the first time a Syrian president will visit the White House since the country’s independence from French colonial rule in 1946.\n\nAl-Sharaa and Trump met before in Saudi Arabia, with the latter describing the former as an “attractive, tough guy”.\n\nBut this is the first time al-Sharaa or any other Syrian president will visit the White House, signalling a warming of relations between the two countries after more than five decades of the al-Assad family’s reign.\n\nThe trip comes after al-Sharaa visited United Nations headquarters in New York City in September, his first time visiting the US.\n\nIt has been an improbable development, considering that al-Sharaa fought US forces in Iraq and was then captured and spent 2006-2011 in US prison camps.\n\nThe meeting also comes as the US is reportedly establishing a military presence at the Mezzeh airbase in Damascus.\n\nSome reports say the US will use this presence to work at brokering a peace pact between Israel and Syria, though Syrian officials have denied this.\n\nFor his part, Barrack has spoken regularly about getting Syria and Israel to sign on to a nonaggression agreement."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/former-french-president-sarkozy-to-be-released-from-prison","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:39:48+00:00","title":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy released from prison pending appeal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from prison after serving three weeks of a five-year sentence for criminal conspiracy related to efforts to secure campaign funding from Muammar Gaddafi in 2007.

Such rhetoric has helped the far-right party  gain prominence  in Germany.\n\nFollowing the attack, security services faced uncomfortable questions about whether it could have been prevented, given Abdulmohsen’s history of extreme rhetoric and violent threats."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/iran-dismisses-us-accusation-of-plot-to-kill-israeli-ambassador-in-mexico","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:08:49+00:00","title":"Iran dismisses US accusation of plot to kill Israeli ambassador in Mexico","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran has rejected US and Israeli claims that its Quds Force planned to assassinate Israeli ambassador Einat Kranz Neiger in Mexico, calling the allegations 'ridiculous' and 'absurd'.

Mexico\n\nTehran, Iran –  Iran has branded accusations from the United States and Israel that it was hatching a plot to assassinate the latter’s ambassador to Mexico as “ridiculous”.\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei told reporters on Monday that Tehran believes Israel is trying to damage its “friendly relations” with other countries through an “absurd allegation”.\n\nUnnamed US and Israeli senior officials told news outlets late last week that the Quds Force, the external operations arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), plotted to assassinate Israeli envoy Einat Kranz Neiger beginning in late 2024 and remaining active into mid-2025.\n\nThe plot was contained and does not pose a current threat, the officials said, without offering any evidence.\n\nIsrael’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs then released a statement thanking the Mexican security and law enforcement services for “thwarting a terrorist network directed by Iran that sought to attack Israel’s ambassador to Mexico”.\n\n“The Israeli security and intelligence community will continue to work tirelessly, in full cooperation with security and intelligence agencies around the world, to thwart terrorist threats from Iran and its proxies against Israeli and Jewish targets worldwide,” a ministry spokesman said.\n\nHowever, Mexico’s foreign relations and security ministries have since denied knowledge of such an incident.\n\nIn a joint statement, they said they have “no report with respect to a supposed attempt against the ambassador of Israel in Mexico”.\n\nThe statement emphasised that Mexico has not initiated disruption to diplomatic ties with any country.\n\nIran’s embassy in Mexico on Monday called the accusation “a media intervention and a great lie” and said it considers “betraying Mexico’s interests to be betraying our own”.\n\nBaghaei said: “Our embassy stated that we found this allegation so absurd and ridiculous that we did not even think it required an official response from the spokesperson.”\n\nBaghaei was quick to point out that Israel has previously made similar accusations against Iran, citing attacks on Jewish synagogues in Australia in late 2024.\n\nThat appeared to be a reference to a testimony given by the New South Wales Police Force to the upper house of the Australian parliament in early October, which presented the result of an investigation into suspected Iranian links to 14 incidents of attacks on synagogues, graffiti, firebombings, and attacks on cars and homes.\n\n“The NSW Police Force has nil holdings in relation to foreign agents perpetrating these incidents,” a police representative told lawmakers at the time.\n\n“Despite official statements by Australian police rejecting any connection to Iran, Israel has continued to insist on Tehran’s involvement,” Baghaei said.\n\nHowever, in late August, Australia accused Iran of directing two “anti-Semitic” arson attacks in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne and gave Tehran’s ambassador seven days to leave the country, the first such expulsion since World War II.\n\nCanberra also designated the  IRGC a “terrorist organisation”  and withdrew its diplomats from Tehran.\n\nAt the time, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation had gathered credible evidence that Iran “orchestrated” last year’s attacks on a kosher restaurant and a synagogue, but did not release the evidence.\n\nAustralia’s move to cut ties with Tehran and proscribe the IRGC came shortly after the US and its European allies  condemned Iran  for what they called a surge in attempts by Iranian intelligence to “kill, kidnap, and harass people in Europe and North America in clear violation of our sovereignty”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/riot-in-ecuador-prison-kills-31-amid-gunfire-and-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:02:00+00:00","title":"Riot

2025-10-23T15:45:13+00:00\n\nTitle: Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/millions-endure-power-cuts-in-ukraine-as-russia-strikes-more-energy-sites","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:21:29+00:00","title":"Millions endure power cuts in Ukraine as Russia strikes more energy sites","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukraine is enduring widespread power outages across multiple regions—including Poltava, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, and Kyiv—due to continuous attacks by Russian drones and missiles.

suffering from a deficit of high-voltage capacity after damage to their power transmission lines while the areas of Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, Kyiv and other central and northern regions have been affected as well.\n\nAccording to Ukraine’s military, Russian forces used two air-launched ballistic missiles, five surface-to-air guided missiles and 67 drones, including those of Iranian design, during their attacks overnight into Monday.\n\nThe Ukrainian army did not report shooting down any of the missiles, but it said 52 of the drones were intercepted and the remaining 15 conducted strikes on nine locations.\n\nRussia has maintained its attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure as United States-led diplomatic efforts to end the war make little progress. Ukraine has also been hitting Russian oil and fuel infrastructure in a stated effort to disrupt resources going to the front lines.\n\nAn explosion rocked Russia’s port town of Tuapse on the Black Sea overnight after Ukrainian forces launched sea drones towards the major oil terminal and refinery in the town. No casualties were reported.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defence announced on Monday that four naval drones were destroyed near the port in the northeastern Black Sea.\n\nIt added that its air defences shot down six US-made HIMARS rockets and 124 fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nWhile calling for tougher sanctions and asset freezes to punish Russia, Ukraine is also looking to buy more arms.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday that Ukraine would like to order 25 Patriot air defence systems from US weapons makers as it tries to fend off Russian attacks at the brink of winter.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged that the missile systems are expensive and such a large order could take years to manufacture. But he suggested that European countries could give their Patriots to Ukraine and await replacements, stressing that “we would not like to wait.”\n\nUkraine is also advancing with an internal drive with a stated aim of weeding out corruption in the energy sector.\n\nThe National Anti-Corruption Bureau announced on Monday that it was conducting searches in cooperation with a specialised anticorruption judicial office in premises connected to Tymur Mindich, a former business partner of the president.\n\nMindich, who reportedly fled before the searches, is coowner of Zelenskyy’s Kvartal 95 production company. The Anti-Corruption Bureau said the searches are in relation to a “high-level criminal organisation in the energy and defence sectors” that engaged in money laundering and illegal enrichment."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/iraqs-pm-al-sudani-may-win-the-elections-but-lose-his-post","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00+00:00","title":"Iraq’s PM al-Sudani may win the elections, but lose his post","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani is running for a second term in the November 11, 2025 parliamentary elections through the Construction and Development Coalition, a broad alliance formed in May 2025.

second term, a goal that requires his electoral bloc, the Construction and Development Coalition, to win a commanding number of seats in the November 11 parliamentary elections and back his selection for the role.\n\nAl-Sudani’s campaign is built on his government’s successes in improving services, maintaining balanced relations between Tehran and Washington, and steering Iraq clear of regional conflict since October 7, 2023.\n\nHowever, while analysts predict al-Sudani’s coalition may win the highest number of seats, it may well disintegrate after the election results are announced.\n\nAl-Sudani’s coalition, announced in May 2025, includes seven political forces.\n\nThe most prominent are Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) Chairman Faleh al-Fayyad; Minister of Labour Ahmed al-Asadi; and Karbala Governor Nassif al-Khattabi.\n\nIt also includes influential tribal leaders (sheikhs) and some 53 incumbent MPs, most of whom won as independents in 2021 or defected from parties within the Shia Coordination Framework (SCF), the main Shia parliamentary bloc that nominated al-Sudani four years ago.\n\nThe coalition also contains the Al-Furratain Current, the party al-Sudani founded after resigning from the Dawa Party following the 2019 Tishreen protests. However, his is the smallest faction in this broad alliance.\n\nLocal observers in central and southern Iraq note that al-Sudani’s success in getting other candidates to run with him masks the weakness of Al-Furratain and may actually be the driver of his coalition’s post-election collapse.\n\nThe coalition’s tickets are dominated by the tribal sheikhs and other candidates, while Al-Furratain’s cadres, those closest and most loyal to al-Sudani, are the least likely to win seats.\n\nThese partners are happy to leverage the prime minister’s current power to further their own popularity, but past elections indicate that their loyalty will be transactional and is not expected to outlast his full prime ministerial authority.\n\nTake al-Fayyad, who al-Sudani protected when Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq (AAH), an SCF party led by Qais al-Khazali, pushed a law that would have forced him into retirement to make way for AAH to rise to more power in the PMF.\n\nWhen al-Sudani becomes a caretaker prime minister after the election and SCF rivals resume their push to remove al-Fayyad, he will seek new alliances to protect himself.\n\nThe tribal sheikhs and MPs use being on al-Sudani’s list to leverage state resources to deliver services in their electoral districts and fast-track government approvals for their constituents.\n\nMP Dhiaa Hindi, a Sudani candidate in Karbala, boasts on Facebook of processing 16,000 official transactions during his three nd a half years in parliament.\n\nThese same MPs may well jump ship when rival blocs, intent on blocking al-Sudani’s second term, offer them financial incentives and influence in the next government.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi tried building a loyal bloc to secure a second term by supporting independent candidates in the 2021 elections, hoping that loyal MPs would strengthen his negotiating position.\n\n“Twenty-three of those we supported won,” recalled a senior official who served in al-Kadhimi’s office, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n“But … when we needed their votes as a bloc to support Kadhimi’s nomination during the government formation talks, they all abandoned [him]. They demanded huge sums of money, luxury cars, and government staff for their personal service. We couldn’t provide these things, even if we wanted to; we were a caretaker government with no legal authority.”\n\nAs a soon-to-be caretaker PM, al-Sudani likely has al-Kadhimi’s experience top of mind.\n\nThe coalition’s “Construction and Development” rhetoric, symbolised by its construction crane logo, centres on al-Sudani’s performance in delivering services.\n\nHowever, most projects are concentrated in Baghdad, while provincial allocations have decreased significantly.\n\nThis is a high-risk political calculation on al-Sudani’s part, a strategy Iraqi political analysts interpret as trying to build a visible legacy in the capital, which holds 69 of parliament’s 329 seats and where he is running as a candidate.\n\nAccording to parliamentary finance committee documents, funds allocated to local governments shrank by 60 percent, from 8.783 trillion dinars ($6.7bn) in previous years to 2.767 trillion ($2.1bn) in 2024 – the federal government holding most of that money to spend in Baghdad.\n\n“What should have been spent on infrastructure, schools, and hospitals in the provinces was spent on roads and bridges in Baghdad,” said MP Adnan al-Zurfi, parliamentary finance committee member for the past 8 years.\n\nNajaf Governor Yousef Kannawi noted that only 60 billion of the 500 billion dinars allocated to his province had arrived.\n\nA Ministry of Finance document from the first half of 2025 shows projects in Baghdad received 822 billion dinars ($629m), while the rest of the central and southern provinces, the main electoral base for Shia parties, received only 600 billion dinars ($459m) combined.\n\nThe notable exception is Karbala, whose Governor al-Khattabi is in al-Sudani’s coalition and received 318 billion dinars ($243m), separate from other governorates.\n\nThese sidelined southern provinces that are paying for al-Sudani’s electoral strategy are traditional strongholds for the SCF.\n\nIn a televised interview on Saturday, AAH’s al-Khazali said a second term for al-Sudani would be “the decision of the Coordination Framework [SCF]”, emphasising that the post is subject to the “Shia consensus”.\n\nHe was referring to the Muhasasa system, in place since the first elected government in 2006, that grants Shia parties the right to name the prime minister, while Kurds name the president and Sunni the speaker of parliament.\n\nNouri al-Maliki, former prime minister and leader of the State of Law coalition, echoed this in a separate interview, saying becoming prime minister “is not related to the number of seats won”.\n\nThese statements are a response to al-Sudani’s attempts to build an independent power base, which SCF leaders like al-Maliki and al-Khazali see as their appointee trying to challenge their long-term control of Shia politics.\n\nThis view was aired by al-Khazali as far back as 2022, when he publicly stated that the prime minister is merely a “director-general”- an administrative, apolitical role. The PM, he insisted, “should not monopolise state decisions … He must return to the Framework for all decisions, whether political, security, or economic.”\n\nThey are publicly reminding him, and his new allies, that he is dispensable and that the path to a second term runs through, not around, them.\n\nThis puts al-Sudani in a bind, with his second term depending on navigating two challenges: First, holding his fragile electoral bloc together and, second, undertaking post-election negotiations with Shia rivals who are already signalling he is dispensable."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-summit-in-brazil-what-to-know-about-the-un-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:36:51+00:00","title":"COP30 summit in Brazil: What we know about the UN climate conference","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The COP30 UN climate conference, hosted in Belem, Brazil, marks a turning point in global climate negotiations, shifting from setting new targets to implementing existing commitments.

But we must do it together.”\n\nCOP is the abbreviation for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, which refers to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a treaty adopted in 1992 that formally acknowledged climate change as a global threat.\n\nThe treaty also enshrined the principle of “common but differentiated responsibility”, meaning that rich countries responsible for the bulk of carbon dioxide emissions should bear the greatest responsibility for solving the problem.\n\nThe UNFCCC formally went into force in 1994 and has become the basis for international deals, such as the 2015  Paris Climate Agreement , designed to limit global temperature increases to about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 to avoid the most catastrophic effects of global warming.\n\nThe first COP summit was held in the German capital, Berlin, in 1995. The rotating presidency, now held by Brazil, sets the agenda and hosts the two-week summit, drawing global attention to climate change while trying to corral member states to agree to new climate measures.\n\nBrazil wants to gather pledges of $25bn and attract a further $100bn from the global financial markets for a Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), which would provide financing for biodiversity conservation, including reducing deforestation.\n\nBrazil has also asked countries to work on realising past promises, such as COP28’s pledge to phase out fossil fuel use. Indeed, the Brazilian government’s overarching goal for this COP is “implementation” rather than setting new goals.\n\n“Our role at COP30 is to create a roadmap for the next decade to accelerate implementation,” Ana Tonix, the chief executive of COP30, was quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper.\n\nAt a summit last week before COP30, Brazilian President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva said: “I am convinced that despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need roadmaps to reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilise the resources necessary for these objectives.”\n\nIn a letter to negotiators released late on Sunday, Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already – from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, super typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines to a tornado ripping through southern Brazil.”\n\nNot only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives”, Stiell wrote.\n\nCOP30 is also the first to acknowledge the failure to so far prevent global warming.\n\nMore than 50,000 people have registered to attend this year’s COP in Belem, including journalists, climate scientists, Indigenous leaders and representatives from 195 countries.\n\nSome of the more prominent official group voices will include the Alliance of Small Island States, the G77 bloc of developing countries and the BASIC Group, consisting of Brazil, South Africa, India and China.\n\nIn September, United States President Donald Trump told the UN General Assembly that climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, based on “predictions … made by stupid people”.\n\nTrump’s aggressive approach to deny the climate crisis has further complicated the agenda at the conference, which will have no representation from Washington. Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement twice – once during his first term, which was overturned by former President Joe Biden, and a second time on January 20, 2025, the day his second term began. He cited the economic burden of climate initiatives on the US. Trump has called climate change a “hoax”.\n\nThe US historically has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. On an annual basis, however, the biggest carbon polluter now is China.\n\nCOP30 organisers have been criticised for the exorbitant prices of hotel rooms in Belem, which has just 18,000 hotel beds. Brazil’s government has stepped in, offering free cabins on cruise ships to poorer nations in a last-minute bid to ensure they can attend.\n\nAs of November 1, only 149 countries had confirmed lodging. The Brazilian government said 37 were still negotiating. Meanwhile, business leaders have decamped to host their own events in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBrazil has also been slammed for clearing forest to build a new road to reach the conference venue.\n\nRenewables, led by solar and wind, accounted for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added worldwide last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Solar energy has now become the cheapest form of electricity in history.\n\nMeanwhile, one in five of new cars sold around the world last year was electric, and there are now more jobs in clean energy than in fossil fuels, according to the UN.\n\nElsewhere, the International Energy Agency has estimated that global clean-energy investment will reach $2.2 trillion this year, which would be about twice as much as on fossil fuel spending.\n\nAt the same time, global temperatures are not just rising, they are climbing faster than ever with new records logged for 2023 and 2024. That finding was part of a study done every few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe new research shows the average global temperature rising at a rate of 0.27C (0.49F) each decade, almost 50 percent faster than in the 1990s and 2000s when the warming rate was around 0.2C (0.36F) per decade.\n\nThe world is now on track to cross the 1.5C threshold by 2030, after which scientists warn that humanity will trigger irreversible climate impacts. Already, the planet has warmed by 1.3C (2.34F) since the pre-industrial era, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nAt the same time, governments around the world spend about $1 trillion each year subsidising fossil fuels.\n\nAt a preparatory summit with dozens of heads of state and government, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The hard truth is that we have failed to ensure we remain below 1.5 degrees.”\n\n“Science now tells us that a temporary overshoot beyond the 1.5 limit – starting at the latest in the early 2030s – is inevitable. We need a paradigm shift to limit this overshoot’s magnitude and duration and quickly drive it down,” he said on Thursday.\n\n“Even a temporary overshoot will have dramatic consequences. It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unliveable conditions and amplify threats to peace and security.”\n\nThe India-Pakistan  heatwave  began unusually early, in April this year. By June, temperatures had reached a peak of about 48C (118.4F) in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Hundreds of lives were lost, and crops were decimated.\n\nEurope also faced extreme heat this year. Over the summer, the region endured a heatwave that pushed cities like Lisbon past 46C  (114.8F). In London, a prolonged period of elevated temperatures in late June caused an estimated excess 260 deaths.\n\nAt the same time,  Mediterranean wildfires  ravaged large tracts of Southern Europe with more than 100,000 people evacuated and dozens of deaths.\n\nTurkiye suffered one of its worst droughts in decades, hitting agricultural areas. Rainfall dropped by up to 71 percent in some areas compared with the previous year, stressing ecosystems and energy and food production."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/us-claims-it-strikes-two-boats-carrying-narcotics-in-pacific-killing-six","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:28:51+00:00","title":"US claims it hit two boats ‘carrying narcotics’ in Pacific, killing six","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States conducted two military strikes in international waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing six people it claims were involved in narcotics smuggling.

are drug boats in international waters headed to the country.\n\nPentagon chief Pete Hegseth said on Monday that the US military targeted two vessels in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Sunday, killing six people.\n\n“These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” he wrote in a social media post.\n\n“Both strikes were conducted in international waters, and three male narco-terrorists were aboard each vessel. All six were killed. No US forces were harmed.”\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has faced mounting criticism over such attacks, including accusations of violating domestic and international law.\n\nBut Washington appears to be stepping up the campaign. Sunday’s deadly double attack was the fourth this month.  Previous strikes  in the Pacific and Caribbean Sea killed at least eight people, according to US authorities.\n\nThe Trump administration started targeting boats in the Caribbean in September and later expanded its military push to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe US has carried out 18 strikes on vessels so far, killing dozens of people.\n\nLast month, United Nations rights chief  Volker Turk said  the US attacks have no justification under international law.\n\n“These attacks – and their mounting human cost – are unacceptable,” Turk said. “The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them.”\n\nThe US has described the attacks as “counterterrorism” operations after having designated drug cartels as “terrorists”.\n\n“Under President Trump, we are protecting the homeland and killing these cartel terrorists who wish to harm our country and its people,” Hegseth said on Monday.\n\nOther than grainy footage showing the strikes, the Trump administration has not provided concrete proof that the vessels targeted were carrying drugs.\n\nTrump himself has previously joked that fishermen are now afraid to operate in the Caribbean off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nCritics have questioned why US authorities would not monitor the boats and intercept them when they enter the country’s territorial waters instead of extrajudicially executing the suspects.\n\nThe strikes have sparked regional tensions, particularly with Venezuela, with Trump accusing its president, Nicolas Maduro, of links to “narcoterrorists”.\n\nThe ramped-up US military campaign near Venezuela has raised speculation that Washington may be preparing for conflict in the oil-rich South American country.\n\nThis month, Trump suggested that  war with Venezuela  is unlikely but said Maduro’s days are numbered."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/10/live-syrias-ahmed-al-sharaa-to-meet-donald-trump-at-the-white-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:59:23+00:00","title":"Syria’s al-Sharaa to meet Trump in historic visit to White House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ahmed al-Sharaa, the Syrian president, is set to make a historic visit to the White House, becoming the first Syrian president to do so in nearly 80 years.

globe, the United Nations has warned before the opening of its annual climate change conference.\n\nThe UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a report, published on Monday to coincide with the launch of the 30th annual UN Climate Change conference (COP) in Brazil, that weather-related disasters caused about 250 million people to flee their homes over the past decade.\n\nThe migration agency issued its second major report on the effect of climate change on refugees – No Escape II: The Way Forward – in the run-up to COP 30, as it appears that the enthusiasm of countries to agree action to curb climate change continues to ebb.\n\n“Over the past decade, weather-related disasters have caused some 250 million internal displacements – equivalent to over 67,000 displacements per day,” the report said .\n\nThe UNHCR added that climate change is also increasing the difficulties faced by those displaced by conflict and other driving forces.\n\n“Climate change is compounding and multiplying the challenges faced by those who have already been displaced, as well as their hosts, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings,” it continued.\n\nFloods in South Sudan and Brazil, record heat in Kenya and Pakistan, and water shortages in Chad and Ethiopia are among the disasters noted in the report.\n\nThe number of countries facing extreme exposure to climate-related hazards is projected to rise from three to 65 by 2040.\n\nThose 65 countries host more than 45 percent of all people currently displaced by conflict, it added.\n\n“Extreme weather is … destroying homes and livelihoods, and forcing families – many who have already fled violence – to flee once more,” UN refugees chief Filippo Grandi said in a statement.\n\n“These are people who have

the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/10/live-syrias-ahmed-al-sharaa-to-meet-donald-trump-at-the-white-house?update=4097399","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:59:23+00:00","title":"Syria’s al-Sharaa to meet Trump in historic visit to White House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ahmed al-Sharaa, Syria's president, is set to make a historic visit to the White House, becoming the first Syrian head of state to do so in nearly 80 years.

bosses resigned over a Trump speech edit?\n\nThe head of the UK’s British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and a top news executive  resigned  from the organisation on Sunday after a memo criticising the editing of a 2021 speech by US President Donald Trump shortly before protesters  stormed the US Capitol  in Washington on January 6, 2021, was leaked.\n\nThe BBC said Director-General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness had chosen to step down after the memo became public.\n\nThe memo was from ex-adviser Michael Prescott, a former journalist who was an independent consultant to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board for three years before leaving in June. He claimed that editors of a 2024 BBC Panorama documentary had spliced two parts of Trump’s speech together so it appeared that he had actively encouraged the Capitol Hill riots of January 6, 2021, which followed his 2020 election defeat.\n\nTrump responded to the pair’s resignation on Sunday night, calling Davie and Turness “very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a presidential election”, in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nDavie said he took “ultimate responsibility” for mistakes made, and had decided to resign after “reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times”.\n\nThe resignations of Davie and Turness followed controversy over a BBC Panorama documentary called “Trump: A Second Chance?”, which was broadcast one week before the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nA clip from the programme appears to show two different parts of Trump’s January 6, 2021 speech joined together into one sequence. In the episode, Trump is shown as saying: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nBut according to a transcript from Trump’s comments that day, he said: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.”\n\nNearly an hour later, Trump then used the phrase “we fight like hell”, but not in reference to the protesters at the Capitol. “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said.\n\nTim Davie became director-general of the BBC in September 2020. He was responsible for overseeing the organisation’s editorial, operational and creative work. He previously led BBC Studios for seven years and worked at companies including Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo.\n\nIn an email to staff on Sunday, Davie said quitting the job after five years “is entirely my decision”. He said he was “working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months”.\n\nMeanwhile, Deborah Turness had been the CEO of BBC News since 2022, leading a team of around 6,000 employees broadcasting to almost half a billion people around the world. She was previously CEO of ITN and president of NBC News.\n\nOver the weekend, Turness said that the controversy over the Trump documentary “has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me”.\n\n“In public life, leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down,” she said in a note to staff. “While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n\nDavid Yelland, former editor of the Sun newspaper, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Monday that Davie and Turness were the victims of a “coup”. However, both they and the BBC deny this.\n\nThe incident prompted criticism of the BBC by Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary, who described the corporation over the weekend as “100 percent fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.\n\nFor his part, Trump  posted  on his Truth Social platform: “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught “doctoring” my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th”.\n\nHe added that “very dishonest people” had “tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election… On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for democracy!”\n\nPrescott’s leaked memo did not only refer to the Panorama editing of Trump’s speech. It also focused criticism on a number of other areas of the BBC’s work, such as its coverage of transgender issues and racism – which he said were “one-sided” and “ill-researched” – but most notably its coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nPrescott accused the BBC of anti-Israel bias within the BBC Arabic service, claiming that contributors over-emphasised stories that were critical of Israel. He also accused the wider corporation of “misrepresenting” the number of women and children killed in Gaza and the issue of Palestinian starvation in the besieged enclave.\n\nThe former BBC adviser said he had sent the memo in “despair at inaction by the BBC Executive” over these and other issues.\n\nCharles Moore, former editor of the Daily Telegraph, a right-wing broadsheet newspaper in the UK, accused the BBC of “the most extraordinary degree of systemic bias, particularly in BBC Arabic” in its coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nOn general news, he told the Today programme, “it’s always [reporting] from a sort of metropolitan left position. Absolutely consistently, that’s how the bias is.”\n\nThe BBC denies that it is institutionally biased, however.\n\nIn February, the United Kingdom’s media regulator Ofcom said a BBC documentary about Palestinian children living through  Israel’s war on Gaza  broke rules on impartiality, as it was narrated by the 13-year-old son of a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas-run government.\n\nFive days after it was broadcast, the BBC removed the documentary Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone from its online streaming platform. In July, the BBC’s own investigation found that the programme had breached its editorial guidelines on accuracy.\n\nBut the BBC has also been accused of being biased in favour of Israel.\n\nIn November, the organisation was accused by more than 100 of its own staff of giving Israel favourable coverage in its reporting of the war on Gaza, and criticised its lack of “accurate evidence-based journalism”.\n\nAn internal letter, signed by more than 100 anonymous staff at the BBC, was sent to Tim Davie and Deborah Turness, stating: “Basic journalistic tenets have been lacking when it comes to holding Israel to account for its actions.”\n\nKarishma Patel, one journalist who quit the BBC over its Gaza coverage, told Al Jazeera: “It is absurd that Panorama’s editorial blunder over Trump’s speech was the final straw for the Director-General and CEO – rather than the worst moments in the BBC’s Gaza coverage across two years: its refusal to air the Gaza medics documentary by Basement Films, significant broadcast of Israel’s defence and not South Africa’s genocide case at the ICJ, public letters signed by BBC journalists concerned about the organisation’s Gaza coverage, some of which I personally organised.\n\n“There have been many crucial moments where we have seen no real accountability and no real change, eroding public and staff trust. “It is very clear that criticisms are only taken seriously if they come via the right wing press, and this influence has shaped the BBC.”\n\nThe BBC, which is funded by a mandatory licence fee payable by all households in the UK that own a television, has long been accused by rival media organisations and politicians of failing to maintain a commitment to impartiality in its coverage of global news and events and of having a “liberal” bias.\n\nIn March 2023, the BBC struggled to contain a scandal over the opinions of  Gary Lineker  – a former professional footballer and its highest-paid sports presenter – on immigration. He was ultimately removed as a presenter of BBC’s Match of the Day show after he criticised the UK government’s asylum-seeker policy, briefly leading to a walkout by some of his colleagues in a show of solidarity.\n\nIn May 2025, controversy over Lineker was reignited after  he shared an Instagram post  about Zionism that included a drawing of a rat, which critics claimed was an anti-Semitic insult.\n\nIn response, Lineker said: “I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am.” The BBC said he would leave the organisation altogether.\n\nElsewhere, the BBC has faced  lasting reputational damage  following revelations that its former TV presenter Jimmy Savile perpetuated decades of sexual abuse, which came to light after his death in 2011.\n\nPosthumous investigations revealed that Savile had exploited his celebrity status and access to BBC facilities to abuse hundreds of victims, many of them children, while complaints to the corporation about his behaviour were ignored and even covered up.\n\nMore recently, the broadcaster was again rocked by allegations involving one of its main news anchors,  Huw Edwards . In 2023, Edwards was accused of paying for up to 41 sexually explicit images he had received on WhatsApp, some of victims aged between seven and nine years.\n\nThe case reignited scrutiny over how the BBC handles staff misconduct, reviving painful questions about trust and oversight within the institution, which eventually admitted that it should have responded to complaints much faster.\n\nSunday’s resignations come at a sensitive time for the BBC, as the government is set to review the corporation’s Royal Charter before the current term expires in 2027.\n\nThe Royal Charter sets out the terms and purpose of the BBC’s operations, and normally lasts for about a decade each time it is renewed.\n\nUK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, who has previously called allegations of bias “incredibly serious”, said a review of the Charter by the government would help the BBC “adapt to this new era”.\n\nJonah Hull, reporting for Al Jazeera in London, said “this is a hugely significant moment for the BBC … arguably the most famous news media brand, built on a reputation of journalistic integrity and impartiality”.\n\nIn addition to the recent scandal over the misleading editing of a Trump speech, Hull said the BBC had also suffered criticism for its coverage of “trans-rights issues, Israel bias … all of which has led to a furore of criticism aimed at the BBC”.\n\nBBC Chair Samir Shah, who apologised for an “error of judgement” over the editing of Trump’s speech in the Panorama programme on Monday, but denied that the BBC is guilty of systemic bias, is due to lay out a vision for the BBC’s future on Monday to Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee.\n\nAt the daily briefing for journalists at 10 Downing Street on Monday, the prime minister’s spokesman also said he does not believe the BBC is “institutionally biased”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/at-least-5-killed-as-typhoon-kalmaegi-slams-into-vietnam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"05:52:55+00:00","title":"At least 5 killed as Typhoon Kalmaegi slams into Vietnam","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi, the 13th storm to form in the South China Sea this year, killed at least five people in Vietnam after making landfall in central and highland provinces, including Dak Lak, Quang Ngai, and Gia Lai.

happened, who voted to end it, what’s next?\n\nThe United States Senate has taken its  first step  towards ending the longest government shutdown in the country’s history as lawmakers agreed to move forward with a stopgap funding package.\n\nThe Republican-led proposal, which would keep the government running until January 30, comes after weekend negotiations between the Republicans and Democrats to end the shutdown, which on Monday entered its  41st day .\n\nThe shutdown, which has surpassed the 35-day record in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term, has disrupted flights across the country, deprived millions of Americans of food aid and left more than 1.3 million federal government employees furloughed or working without pay.\n\nThe Senate passed a procedural vote on Sunday, which means the vote was not over the bill, but it will allow the bill to move forward so senators can debate and eventually vote on it. This 60-40 test vote marks the first step in a series of procedural manoeuvres.\n\n“Now, this is what is called a cloture vote, a procedure by which the Senate agrees to continue the debate about the legislation and begins introducing and passing the bills aimed at ending the shutdown,” Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna said, reporting from Washington, DC.\n\nIf the Senate eventually passes the bill, the package still must be approved by the House of Representatives before being sent to Trump for his signature to become law.\n\nIn the Senate, Republicans hold 53 seats and Democrats have 47, but Republicans do not have the 60 votes needed to advance bills. Eight senators who caucus with the Democrats voted to move the Republican measure forward.\n\nIn the House, Republicans hold 220 seats while Democrats have 212.\n\nThe measure would provide yearlong funding for certain parts of the government, including for food assistance programmes and the legislative branch.\n\nIt does not extend health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which Democrats have been demanding to pass any funding measure. The ACA was passed in 2010 under President Barack Obama and expanded health insurance coverage.\n\nHowever, centrist Democrats and Republicans reached a deal to vote in December on extending the healthcare tax credits, which are due to expire this year. The subsidies under the ACA help low-income Americans pay for private insurance.\n\nDemocrats have been promised that the Trump administration will continue to employ government employees furloughed due to the shutdown and extend the expiring healthcare tax credits, according to the US-based news site Politico.\n\nBut no official information about the bill has been available so far.\n\nIn a statement before the vote, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, the Republican leader of the chamber, lauded the “bipartisan way” to address the crisis.\n\nBut Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, expressed concerns. “For months and months, Democrats have been fighting to get the Senate to address the healthcare crisis. This bill does nothing to ensure that that crisis is addressed,” he said.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump proposed to send ACA subsidies directly into people’s bank accounts, building pressure on the Democrats.\n\n“I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,” he posted on his Truth Social platform.\n\nIn July, Trump and Congress  cut Medicaid  funding by $930bn over the next decade as part of his “Big Beautiful Bill”. Medicaid is the biggest government-run health programme and provides care to low-income people.\n\nThe measure passed in a 60-40 vote. Eight members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate voted for the bill. All Republicans voted for the measure except Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky.\n\nDemocratic senators who voted for the motion to advance the bill included Dick Durbin of Illinois; Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire; John Fetterman of Pennsylvania; Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada; and Tim Kaine of Virginia.\n\nIndependent Senator Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, also voted in favour of the measure.\n\nYes.\n\nSchumer said before the vote that he could not support the measure “in good faith”. The Senate minority leader, who faced criticism from fellow Democrats in March for voting with Republicans to keep the government open, said the party has now “sounded the alarm” on healthcare.\n\n“We will not give up the fight,” Schumer said.\n\nBernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, said that giving up the fight would be a “horrific mistake”.\n\nDemocratic Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said local and state elections last week saw support for Democratic candidates because voters were expecting Democrats to hold firm in the negotiations.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani won the  New York mayoral election . Democrats also won gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia on the same day.\n\nSince the beginning of the shutdown, Democratic senators voted 14 times not to reopen the government as they demanded the extension of the ACA tax credits.\n\nThe shutdown has resulted in about 750,000 federal employees being furloughed, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). A furloughed employee is suspended or discharged for a period of time without pay.\n\nThis would result in a daily loss of about $400m in wages, the CBO said. Based on this number, the shutdown has resulted in an estimated loss of $16bn in pay over 40 days.\n\nScott Lucas, a professor of US and international politics at the Ireland-based University College Dublin’s Clinton Institute, put the loss to the US economy at $7bn to $14bn. “That loss in gross domestic product, GDP, is estimated to be around 1.5 percent this quarter,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nIf the bill advanced on Sunday would eventually pass and become law, it would bring back furloughed federal workers, repay states that funded federal programmes during the shutdown, prevent further layoffs until January and ensure workers are paid once the shutdown ends.\n\nLucas added that millions of Americans are now paying more than double in premiums for their health insurance as the tax credits are slated to lapse. And there is no surety that the December vote would extend those credits, he said.\n\nHe also pointed out that nearly 42 million Americans have lost their food assistance provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). “No government support for those payments, and the Trump administration has ordered states, which offered food assistance payments, to return that money,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hanna explained that once a cloture vote passes, all later votes on a bill need only a simple majority in the Senate.\n\n“The important thing about the cloture vote is that once it is passed at that 60 percent majority, every subsequent vote is by a simple majority. So it would appear to be plain sailing in the Senate for the Republicans to pass this bill and end this closure,” Hanna said.\n\nIf the Senate eventually passes the bill, the same version of it would have to pass the House and be signed by Trump. This process could take a few days."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/syrias-al-sharaa-pledges-commitment-to-climate-goals-at-cop30","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:02:54+00:00","title":"Syria’s al-Sharaa pledges commitment to climate goals at COP30","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the successful overthrow of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December 2024, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has emerged as a key figure in Syria’s political and diplomatic revival.

Brazil, pledging his commitment to global efforts to limit climate change, in the latest sign that the war-torn country is returning to the international fold.\n\nAl-Sharaa told the Brazil summit on Thursday that his country was fully on board with the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  and invited investments in renewable energy as part of his country’s “ambitious” plans for reconstruction and recovery.\n\nThe president acknowledged the complex challenges faced by Syria after the 14-year civil war that finally toppled longtime president  Bashar al-Assad  last December, in a definitive lightning offensive led by al-Sharaa, while underlining the urgency of tackling climate change, which hit Syria hard this year with “a drought unlike any it has seen in over six decades”.\n\nHe called on nations to strengthen “bonds of cooperation from the Amazon to the Barada and Euphrates rivers, within a framework of strong inter-state collaboration and in support of the growing role of developing nations”.\n\nHis visit to the Amazon came before talks with United States President Donald Trump in Washington. The White House declined to send high-level officials to the summit after Trump told the UN General Assembly (UNGA) this year that climate change is the world’s “greatest con job”.\n\nOn Thursday, the UN Security Council voted to remove  sanctions  imposed on al-Sharaa and his Interior Minister Anas Khattab, marking yet another step out of the international isolation that marked the al-Assad years.\n\nThe resolution, championed by the US, was seen as a largely symbolic move as sanctions were waived every time al-Sharaa needed to travel outside Syria anyway. He was the first Syrian head of state to attend the annual UNGA gathering in September in almost six decades,  where he called for a lifting of all sanctions  against his country.\n\nAn assets freeze and arms embargo will also be lifted.\n\nAl-Sharaa led opposition fighters who overthrew President Bashar al-Assad’s government in December.\n\nHis group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS),  began an offensive  on November 27, 2024, reaching Damascus in only 12 days, resulting in the end of the al-Assad family’s 53-year reign.\n\nOn Saturday, US special envoy Tom Barrack said Syria is expected to join the US-led anti-ISIL (ISIS) coalition, describing it as “a big step” and “remarkable”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/10/live-syrias-ahmed-al-sharaa-to-meet-donald-trump-at-the-white-house?update=4097449","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:59:23+00:00","title":"Syria’s al-Sharaa to meet Trump in historic visit to White House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ahmed al-Sharaa, the President of Syria, is set to make a historic visit to the White House, becoming the first Syrian president to do so in nearly 80 years.

massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the controversy surrounding a proposed resumption of U.S. nuclear weapon testing under President Donald Trump, who claimed to have ordered the Department of Defense to restart nuclear testing.

will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"7112-03-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article covers a range of science and technology developments, including breakthroughs in genetics and mRNA-based cancer vaccines, environmental efforts like cloud seeding in Delhi, geopolitical tensions affecting tech supply chains (e.g., China’s ban on Nexperia products), and the emergence of the UK as an AI hub.

Budgeting gets a bad reputation. \"The first image that comes to most people's mind is dieting or imprisonment,\" says Jesse Mecham, founder of the budgeting software  You Need A Budget . But that, Mecham says, is an inaccurate picture. \"Budgeting is not about being handcuffed. It's really about being liberated.\" It might just be empowering for you. Keeping tabs on where your money is going is a good first step to cutting back on spending and saving more, if you're able to do so.  These six budgeting tips will help you track your spending and make more informed decisions about your money — and your life.  1. Don't budget just because you think you should. If you're budgeting because you think that's what responsible grown-ups do, that's not super-concrete or motivational. Instead, set a specific goal that has meaning to you, like paying off credit card debt or student loans or saving for a vacation, says Kristin Wong, author of  Get Money: Live the Life You Want, Not Just the Life You Can Afford .  \"Now you have a reason to say  no  to that $50 dinner, because you have something to say  yes  to now,\" Wong says.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Boost Your Credit Card IQ  \n       2. Harness your freakout. Big life changes — a move or a job loss — can bring big stress. Leverage that anxiety by channeling it into motivation to adjust your budget. \"Those moments, where you have the willpower or you have the energy, you have this motivation,\" Mecham says. \"That motivation is fleeting.\" So take advantage of budgeting momentum while it lasts. If you mess up or overspend later on, don't quit. Mecham stresses the importance of being flexible: \"You just make adjustments, like a coach [at] a basketball game making halftime adjustments. You just adjust to how the team plays.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  Never Pay An Unnecessary Fee Again \n       3. Follow the 50-30-20 method. When you get started, try  the guidelines  that Sen. Elizabeth Warren helped develop as a Harvard University professor. The largest portion, 50%, of take-home income should go toward basic living expenses — housing, groceries, etc. Then 30% for discretionary expenses, like entertainment and clothes; and 20% for savings and paying down debt. 4. Use the power of scarcity. With credit cards and overdraft protections, \"we've gotten really used to the idea that we never really run out of money,\" Mecham says. But having a sense of scarcity can be helpful when you're trying to save. Remember back when you were a kid and all you had was that $5 from babysitting or mowing lawns? You were probably pretty careful about how you spent that money because once you did, it was gone. Try designating a certain amount of money for each budgeting category every month, and when you run out, it's out. 5. A roommate is worth a thousand coffees. It's unlikely you'll reach your budget goal just by cutting back on coffees. Housing, food and transportation are usually the biggest expenses. \"If you get a roommate or move to a cheaper place, those major decisions are going to save you so much more money,\" says Wong. \"They're harder decisions to make, obviously. But they give you more bang for your buck.\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  6 Simple Rules For Saving Money \n       6. Try different budgeting techniques to see what works for you. Whether it's a simple spreadsheet or a  budgeting app with lots of categories , use the system that works for you. Mecham says the main thing is not to wait until a \"normal month\" to get started — that will never come. So just start doing it, like right now. It's worth making a budget now, and if it changes in the coming months or year, that's OK.   You Need A Budget has been a sponsor of NPR in the past.

Oh, hang on, guys. I just got to enter this beer and my share of the nachos into my budget app. I mean, who wants to deal with that? But if it's such a drag though, why are some of you talking about budgeting like this? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I have had such a positive experience budgeting recently. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: And I am budgeting wizzard. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I'm actually super jazzed about it. It's, like, all I want to talk about. ARNOLD: A budgeting wizard, I love that guy. Super jazzed, all they want to talk about - what is going on with these people? What is their secret? This is your NPR LIFE KIT. This episode, budgeting - we're going to figure out how to join this party, how to convert a dreary, anxiety-producing, emotionally-fraught task into something conquerable, empowering and maybe even fun. We're going to learn how right after this. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: I'm Chris Arnold, and I cover personal finance for NPR. And in this episode, we're going to give you six tips for setting up and sticking to your budget. And our first big takeaway - call it tip number one - you need a goal. But it can't just be any goal - right? - because, I mean, you want to stick with this. You want to be a budgeting wizard. You need motivation. This is going to be fun. It can't be just any goal. KRISTIN WONG: It has to be something that's specific and meaningful to you. ARNOLD: That's Kristin Wong. She's written a book called \"Get Money.\" And she writes about personal finance for Lifehacker and other publications. And she says, you don't want to try to start a budget just because you think it's something that you should do. WONG: If you just have, like, a vague goal - like, oh, well, I mean, I need to be an adult. I need to be a responsible grown-up. You know, I think most of us when we start budgeting or start wanting to get our finances in order, that's the goal - the best goal that we come up, you know. Like, it's time to be an adult. And it's just not a goal that really serves us because it doesn't really mean anything. And, I mean, also who wants to be a responsible adult? (Laughter) That just doesn't sound fun. ARNOLD: Deep down, that's not really what we want. WONG: No. ARNOLD: Kristin says, pick a goal that actually is something that you really, really want. WONG: Like, maybe you want to get out of $10,000, $20,000 worth of student loan debt. Maybe you want to save up $3,000 for a trip to South America. Then on a Friday night, where you have nothing else to do, and your friends say, hey, let's go to this hip new restaurant. You know it's going to be 50 bucks, but you don't really have a good reason to say no except that, you know, this budget tells you not to. But when you have a goal like, OK, I want to save $3,000 for a trip to South America, well, now you have a reason to say no to that $50 dinner because you have something to say yes to now. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: OK. So a trip to South America is fun and exciting. But, of course, a lot of times what gets us serious about wanting to make a budget is that we're not having fun. There is, like, a moment of crisis or a huge life shift. This is our next takeaway - tip number two - if you are freaking out about money, harness the freakout. JESSICA FISHER: My water broke, and we had quite the experience. ARNOLD: That's Jessica Fisher (ph). She was on her way to the hospital, in labor obviously. And you know the scene - contractions, everybody's getting anxious. It probably didn't help that her husband pulled the car over to buy a burrito on the way to the hospital before they finally got there. FISHER: I started having contractions, you know, pretty frequently with not a lot of time in between them. And Ryan's sitting there eating his Chipotle and kind of making me mad. So I flipped to my phone. ARNOLD: And Jessica's feeling like, OK, we're having this baby. This is going to cost money - child care, someday college. I mean, burrito guy here is not looking terribly full of answers at the moment. FISHER: I was trying to not feel the contractions as bad, so I'm scrolling through Facebook in between contractions. And I see a post about a budgeting program, and it said it was on sale. It hit me right at that moment that this is what we need to do. This is what's going to make everything work. And I pass the phone to my husband. I said figure out how to buy this budgeting program. That kind of, you know, calmed me down a little bit because I really, you know, had started panicking about what we were going to do with three kids when we brought my youngest daughter home. JESSE MECHAM: I'll have to meet this woman at some point. (Laughter) That blows my mind. ARNOLD: That's Jesse Mecham. And that budgeting program that Jessica bought, he invented it. It's called You Need A Budget, or YNAB for short. And we should say the company's been a sponsor of NPR before. But we're talking to Jesse because YNAB has this vast community of loyal users - like, hundreds of thousands of people. And Jesse's interviewed a bunch of them, and it turns out, a lot of them are kind of like Jessica, having her baby and freaking out about money. MECHAM: Or they had decided they were going to move. Or the breadwinner lost a job. I think those moments where you have the willpower or you have the energy or whatever it is, you have this motivation, that motivation is fleeting. ARNOLD: It might be getting out of college and having to start paying student loans and feeling like, uh-oh, I've got to figure this out. But whatever it is, Jesse says harness that freakout. You have an impulse to knuckle down and get started and do it. And as you do it - and he says this is important - forget everything that you think you know about what making a budget is actually going to be like. MECHAM: I mean, the first image that comes to most people's mind is either dieting or imprisonment. And what we try and get people to think is budgeting's not about being handcuffed. It's really about being liberated to start to decide what you want to do instead of just reacting to everything that comes your way. And so it's not about saying, hey, don't spend here, don't spend there, cut back on this. Never eat out. None of that. It's just about saying, what do you really want? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: So those are our first two tips - what's your specific goal, the thing you really want? And use your angst for motivation. And we're talking to Jesse from YNAB, but there's also all kinds of other tools and apps out there. Mint is really popular. We've got a link to a free, simple spreadsheet you can use at /lifekit. And, look. If you're still like, budgeting, that's going to be a drag, I don't know, Jesse says, look, getting started can be pretty painless. And at first, all you want to do is just track where the money is going and kind of see what's going on. And he says sometimes it's best if you don't try to change too much, too fast. MECHAM: Especially don't cut back right away. You know, you're just getting started. You have someone that's been spending, I don't know, $1,200 a month on groceries, and then they come in and they say, we'll spend $500 'cause we're really serious. That's a recipe for disaster. You know, don't go zealot on me too quickly. ARNOLD: OK. So now, though, it is time to take out and sharpen your pencil. WONG: Then, you know, comes the dirty work of actually putting together the budget and deciding how your income gets divvied up among different categories. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: And Kristin says there's a good rule of thumb here that a lot of experts talk about. This is tip No. 3. We've got some numbers coming up here, but it's going to be OK. It's not that complicated. It's called 50-30-20. And Elizabeth Warren actually used to talk about this back when she was a Harvard professor and she was looking into the pressures that middle-class families face. And, all right, it's called 50-30-20. Here's how it works. WONG: It goes like this. Fifty percent of your after-tax, take-home income should go toward basic living necessities, like your rent, like your groceries, like your utility bill. ARNOLD: So that's easy. Half your income for the big fixed costs in life. WONG: And then 30 percent should go toward discretionary expenses - things that you don't necessarily need but you want, like your Netflix subscription, restaurant spending. You know, clothing, makeup. Stuff like that. ARNOLD: And then that last part, the 20 percent that's left over... WONG: Should go toward savings and debt goals. ARNOLD: And these are guidelines, a good place to start. The saving, of course, is going to be the hardest part for a lot of people. That is very tough, especially when you're not making that much money. But we have a whole episode just on how to save more money. There's a lot of good, high-value information in there. So check that out. But with this 50-30-20 thing, what you're doing here is you're starting to organize and place some limits on your spending. MECHAM: The budget is, it's a tool to manufacture scarcity regularly. ARNOLD: And like Jesse was saying, this is the part that people think is going to feel like handcuffs. But he says that pinch, that scarcity, that's actually really powerful. I mean, you could kind of think about like this. Like, remember when you were a kid and all you had was that $5 or $10 allowance, or money from babysitting or mowing lawns or whatever? You were probably pretty careful about how you spent that money because once you did, it was gone. MECHAM: This moment that we never experienced now, where you end up with zero dollars or really, really close to it. We've eliminated this scarcity because banks have introduced very profitable mechanisms to have you just walk past zero and overdraft a little bit and pay them a fee. Or you can just, if you run out of money in your checking account, you just swipe your credit card and you've walked past zero again. We've gotten really used to the idea that we never really run out of money. ARNOLD: So Jesse says this is the whole point of the budget, to get back to a world where we do run out of money, to feel that scarcity. And this is tip No. 4. You want to make the power of scarcity work for you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: So if your budget says $800 for groceries this month or $50 for coffee - whatever it is - that is way better than just looking at what's in your checking account. MECHAM: Absolutely, if, yeah, you never look at your checking account balance to see if you can spend anything. Because that's a big pile of money or small pile, whatever it may be. But it's a pile that doesn't tell you any information at all. All it tells you is what your checking account balance is. But it doesn't tell you if half of that money is reserved to pay a large bill that's coming up, and a little bit that's left over is to pay a preschool tuition and then you've got some left to pay the lights. And you're sitting there wondering if you should buy boots, you know? It shouldn't even be in the equation. So the moment I know someone's really got it is when they'll tell me, Jesse, I went to look to see if we should go out to eat, and we only had, you know, $20 in our restaurants category so we decided to get some pizzas instead. I felt broke. That phrase is great. They'll say, I feel broke because I can't go out to eat where I want to go out to eat at this moment, but my checking account has never been bigger. And that is where I say, OK, this person got it. They're manufacturing scarcity around the priority of how much should we spend on restaurants. But on the flip side, they've got money set aside to go on some great vacation where they'll get to enjoy themselves, guilt-free. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: Jesse says a key part of that story about the pizza is that you have to actively look at your budget as you go throughout the month so it can help you make decisions. Also you definitely want to have different categories in your budget but, Jesse says, don't go overboard. Like, does toothpaste go under health care? Or maybe under groceries? I know. Maybe I need, like, a hygiene category. MECHAM: And I'd say, whoa, whoa. (Laughter) You know? Whoa. Do you ever make a decision based on the information you are collecting? And if the answer is no, don't collect that information anymore. ARNOLD: But you are going to get some useful information as you go through and make your budget. And all of a sudden, as you're tracking your spending and you're seeing where all the money's going, Kristin says you want to go through, kind of like, a brushfire or doing some weeding and just get rid of stuff. I mean subscriptions, a magazine you don't read, some online service you signed up for that you just don't use. WONG: You know, my big one is candles from Target. I don't know why I love spending, I just - (laughter) like, the amount of money I spend on candles, yeah, is so stupid. ARNOLD: Jesse says everybody he talks to cuts back on one thing, for sure - going out to eat. MECHAM: Not one - not one - has ever said, well, we kept eating out at the same level, and we found our savings somewhere else. Every one of them cuts their eating out dramatically. ARNOLD: And now we're getting into our next big idea here. You want to go after the big stuff, too, and not just the little pick-me-up purchases and candles at Target. WONG: Where are you going to get the most bang for your buck when it comes to cutting back? If you look at the areas where you spend the most money - and think about, like, your rent, your housing, your food, transportation - those are, I think, the three biggest areas most of us spend money on. If you tackle - if you make one decision to cut back on any one of those areas, it's going to save you so much more money and time and energy than trying to cut back on coffee every day or avocado toast every week. Sometimes if you get a roommate or move to a cheaper place, those major decisions are going to save you so much more money. They're harder decisions to make, obviously. But they give you more bang for your buck. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: This is our next big takeaway here, tip No. 5. A roommate is worth a thousand cups of coffee. Or actually, maybe more, right? If you live in a city, a roommate could be $15,000 a year in money to help you pay your rent or your mortgage. And Kristin has walked the walk here. WONG: You know, I was one of those millennials that boomeranged (laughter) and moved back in with my mom when I was paying my student loan. I paid it off so much faster, and I saved so much money. And I'm very lucky. My mom doesn't charge me rent. We come from this culture where my mom would still have me living at home, if she could. But, you know, it's just, sometimes you have to give up what you think life should look like to think about what it could look like. ARNOLD: And sure, I mean, moving in with her mom was kind of a bummer in her mid-20s, but... WONG: Sometimes I do miss those, you know, Friday nights where we'd just sit at home, the two of us, and watch \"What Not To Wear\" and eat takeout. And, you know, I think about those memories now fondly. It wasn't that bad. It worked in my favor, and I was able to get out of debt and then focus on my career. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: When it comes to exactly how you organize and structure your budget, you can do this lots of different ways, right? I mean, super-detailed with a spreadsheet or a budgeting app with lots of categories, or you can keep it a lot more simple. We heard from a listener, Wendy Spitzer (ph), in North Carolina. And she's got a budgeting system that she calls week money, as in how much money she's going to spend this week. WENDY SPITZER: And in week money, every Friday, I take out an allotted amount of money from an ATM, and that money has to cover all daily living expenses for the upcoming week. So that would include needs like groceries, or gas for your car, transportation, as well as anything for fun money you might use in the course of the week. ARNOLD: Bigger expenses, like rent, car payments, utilities, that's not part of this. But everything else, she lumps into basically one big, simple category of money that she can spend this week. And if she makes an online purchase, she'll take the cash out of her wallet. And then when it's gone, no more eating out, no more impulse buys in the checkout line. And with this budget system, over time, Wendy has saved a lot of money. I mean, she has a very modest salary, and she was able to buy her own house. SPITZER: It was, I think, quite shocking to a lot of people I knew because I was living on such little money. But, like, you make a small change. It becomes a habit. You institute or implement that habit for many years. And I have been able to put a down payment for a house, and I have been able to save for retirement. So it's worked really well for me. ARNOLD: I'm a fan of Wendy's strategy here because it's simple, and I'm not like a super detail-oriented guy when it comes to tracking every single purchase and doing a budget. I mean, look. Planning for retirement - yes, the big stuff - but, you know, the little stuff, it's hard for me. I think it's hard for a lot of people. So this is our last big takeaway - tip number six. You want to try different things and find a budgeting system that works for you. So if you want to keep it simple, keep it simple. And people come up with their own systems all the time. I mean, Jesse's budgeting software YNAB, that evolved from just a spreadsheet that he created on his own to help him and his wife save money when they were still in school. And they just kind of stuck it up there on the Internet and tried to sell it. MECHAM: It launched as a very embarrassing spreadsheet that I love to look at still and... ARNOLD: Can you describe the spreadsheet? MECHAM: I don't want to because it's embarrassing. You know, Excel has so many colors you can choose, and I chose all of them in my first spreadsheet. You know, so it was just - it was a hideous cacophony of color and - but it worked. And it taught me that the tool is - it really plays second fiddle. And the first most important thing is your approach. And the effective thing about the tool that I built was that it forced us to approach our money, thinking about it in a different way. ARNOLD: Meaning thinking about budgets and money as a way to have the best life that you possibly can - the things that you really want with the money that you have. Whether that's more great vacations or paying off your student loans or saving up to buy a house, this is what makes budgeting feel fun. You get good at this, and it affects your life in a lot of good ways. And so to get there, Jesse says the main thing is look, just get started doing it, like right now, this month. MECHAM: I mean, life is - if it's not changing or abnormal, you know, we're probably dead or darn close to it. And people will often - they'll say, oh, I'm going to wait - let's wait for a normal month, honey, before we do blah or before we undertake this thing. And there just is no normal month ever. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: OK, so this is doable. We can do this budget thing. To help you remember the most important stuff, here's Kristin and Jesse with the key takeaways. Number one, you need the right kind of goal to help motivate you. WONG: Make sure that it's specific and meaningful to you. ARNOLD: Tip number two. WONG: If you have a big life event that is making you anxious or stressed about money, harness that stress and that anxiety and turn lemons into motivation. ARNOLD: Tip number three, a good place to get started with your budget... WONG: Is the 50-30-20 method - 50 percent of your take-home income goes toward basic living necessities, 30 percent goes toward discretionary expenses, your wants, and 20 percent goes toward saving and debt goals. ARNOLD: And tip number four - this is my favorite kind of big concept - use the power of scarcity. MECHAM: Don't view scarcity as a negative. Use the power of scarcity to help flesh out your true priorities. And don't think of budgeting as handcuffs. Think of it as freedom. ARNOLD: Number five. WONG: A roommate is worth 1,000 cups of coffee. ARNOLD: And our last one, number six. MECHAM: At the end of the day, you want to try different things and find out what works for you.

Fung-wong after earlier storm kills over 200\n\nTyphoon Kalmaegi has left a trail of devastation across Southeast Asia, killing hundreds in the Philippines and at least five in Vietnam, flattening homes, uprooting trees and knocking out power to millions, but there could be more suffering to come.\n\nRescue operations were suspended and mass evacuations began on Saturday as another storm, Typhoon Fung-wong, approached the Philippines, just days after  Kalmaegi  killed at least 204 people.\n\nAuthorities warned that Fung-wong, expected to strengthen into a super typhoon before landfall, could blanket nearly the entire country. “Its radius is so wide it could cover almost the whole Philippines,” a government meteorologist said.\n\nOfficials have urged residents in coastal and low-lying areas to seek safety, fearing more flooding and landslides after last week’s destruction.\n\nEmergency shelters were prepared nationwide as the country braces for what could be one of the season’s most powerful storms.\n\nIn the Philippines, grief and exhaustion swept through the province of Cebu in Kalmaegi’s destructive and deadly wake. Families gathered around rows of white coffins, mourning loved ones lost to floods and landslides.\n\nJimmy Abatayo, who lost his wife and nine relatives, was overcome with guilt as he touched his wife’s coffin. “I told my family to swim, be brave and keep swimming,” he said, breaking into tears. “They did not hear what I said because I would never see them again.”\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr has declared a state of national emergency as the country braces for Typhoon Fung-wong, which is expected to strike early next week. Marcos said the sheer volume of rainfall had overwhelmed flood defences, forcing residents to flee to rooftops for safety.\n\nAccording to the Office of Civil Defense, Kalmaegi  displaced  more than half a million people. Nearly 450,000 sought shelter in evacuation centres or with relatives, as rescue crews continued to search for more than 100 missing people.\n\nIn Vietnam, state media reported five deaths, three in Dak Lak province and two in Gia Lai, and three people missing in Quang Ngai city. The storm destroyed or damaged nearly 2,600 homes and cut power to more than 1.6 million households. In Quy Nhon, residents emerged to find metal roofs and furniture scattered across streets, while shopkeepers laid out soaked goods to dry.\n\nAuthorities said more than 537,000 Vietnamese had been evacuated before the storm hit, with Kalmaegi dumping up to 600mm (24in) of rain before weakening into a tropical storm and moving into Cambodia.\n\nThe Philippines and Vietnam, two of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, face typhoons almost yearly. But scientists warn that  climate change  is causing stronger and more frequent storms.\n\nKristen Corbosiero, an atmospheric sciences professor at the University at Albany, said Kalmaegi was already the fourth-strongest typhoon of the season. “The warm waters that fuel these storms are there almost year-round,” she said, warning that rising sea temperatures are intensifying their destructive power."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has expanded its social media ban for children under 16 to include Reddit and Kick, alongside Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube, with the ban set to take effect on December 10, 2025.

rushing to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA.

pollution: Hundreds protest in Delhi against toxic air\n\nHundreds of people staged a rare protest in Delhi on Sunday against worsening air pollution, as air quality continues to deteriorate in India's capital and nearby regions.\n\nOver the past three weeks, Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI), which measures the level of PM 2.5 or fine particulate matter in the air that can clog lungs, has hovered between 300 and 400, which is 20 to 30 times higher than the World Health Organization's safe limit.\n\nThe protesters held banners and shouted slogans, demanding that the government take action to curb pollution.\n\nAround 80 of them were briefly detained near India Gate after police said they did not have permission to gather at the landmark.\n\n\"Our lungs are getting damaged. The government should declare it a health emergency until they find a solution to it,\" a protester told news agency PTI.\n\nAir quality in Delhi and its suburbs is relatively poor throughout the year due to vehicular emissions, dust and industrial pollutants. But the problem gets worse in the winters because of farmers burning crop stubble in neighbouring states, along with low wind speed trapping pollutants close to the ground.\n\nThough air pollution is a recurring problem in northern India, this was the first big protest on the issue in a while.\n\nOn Monday morning, Delhi's AQI was 330 according to the federal government-run Safar app.\n\nLevels between 101 and 200 are considered moderate, while those between 201 and 300 are \"poor\". Between 301 and 400 is categorised as \"very poor\" and a figure higher than 400 is considered \"severe\".\n\nBut the readings were higher on other sources, such as private air quality monitors\n\nAccording to the Air Visual app operated by Swiss air quality technology company IQAir, Delhi's pollution levels were between 414 and 507, which the app classified as hazardous.\n\nOn Sunday, close to 400 men and women of all ages, including children accompanying their parents, participated in the protest at India Gate.\n\nSeveral demonstrators wore gas masks as a symbolic gesture of protest.\n\nA banner read 'Right to live, not just survive', while another said 'Life in Delhi: Take birth, breathe, die'.\n\nPolice said they detained around 80 people who were released later.\n\n\"India Gate is not a protest site. It is a high-security area,\" senior Delhi Police officer Devesh Mahla told reporters, adding that all the detained individuals were adults.\n\nSeveral opposition leaders, university students, journalists and environmental activists were among the protesters.\n\n\"We have reached severe and hazardous levels of pollution, but the GRAP measures have not been implemented,\" Delhi-based environmental activist Bhavreen Kandhari told PTI.\n\nGRAP refers to the government's Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to tackle air pollution in Delhi and its suburbs.\n\nCurrently, the second level of the action plan is in place. It imposes restrictions on the use of diesel generators and burning of coal and firewood.\n\nThe third level of the action plan, GRAP III, which would also ban all non-essential construction activities and the plying of diesel vehicles in Delhi, is yet to be imposed despite air quality levels getting worse.\n\n\"This is about our children… My children will live 10 years less than their cousins (in other cities) who breathe cleaner air. We still have hope, and that's why we are here,\" Ms Kandhari added.\n\nAnother protester told reporters that recent measures taken by the government, such as sprinkling water on the roads and a recent  unsuccessful cloud-seeding attempt , are not solving the problem. \"The government should take the issue seriously,\" he said.\n\nDelhi's environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, said on Sunday night that the government was taking all possible steps to address the issue.\n\n\"We have installed anti-smog guns in all high-rise buildings, dust mitigation is being done across the city through water sprinklers, all construction sites are being monitored, and we have increased electric vehicles in Delhi's fleet of public buses,\" he said in a video statement.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   Twitter  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mx28vlp4wo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:25:48.734+00:00","title":"Why have BBC bosses Tim Davie and Deborah Turness resigned after Trump documentary?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"BBC Director General Tim Davie and CEO of BBC News Deborah Turness have resigned following a major controversy over a Panorama documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?' that was alleged to have edited a speech by Donald Trump in a way that made it appear he encouraged violence at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.

head of news Deborah Turness have resigned, saying in emails to BBC staff that mistakes had been made.\n\nThe BBC has been under fire after criticism that a Panorama documentary misled viewers, when it edited a speech by Donald Trump, making it look like he was explicitly urging people to attack the US Capitol.\n\nIt was highlighted in a leaked BBC memo,  published by the Telegraph newspaper last week .\n\nBBC chair Samir Shah has now addressed the story, saying that after \"further reflection... the BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement.\"\n\nBut BBC News has learned that Trump has sent a letter to the corporation threatening legal action.\n\nThe BBC confirmed it has received the letter and will respond in due course.\n\nThe memo in the Telegraph also criticised other areas of BBC News, including reporting of trans issues, and BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nBut on Monday Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said the prime minister does not believe the BBC is \"institutionally biased\".\n\nNumber 10 also denied the BBC was \"corrupt\" - a word Trump used to describe some journalists at the corporation.\n\nTim Davie was  appointed director general  of the BBC in September 2020.\n\nEarning a salary between £540,000 and £544,999 , he oversees the corporation's services and is responsible for its editorial, operational and creative leadership.\n\nDeborah Turness,  whose salary was between £430,000 and £434,999 , had been the CEO of BBC News  since 2022 , overseeing news and current affairs programmes.\n\nHer role has responsibility for a team of about 6,000 people, broadcasting to audiences of almost half a billion across the world, in more than 40 languages.\n\nIt is both seismic and unprecedented for both of them to quit the corporation at the same time,  says BBC Culture and Media editor Katie Razzall.\n\nDavie and Turness's resignations come after controversy over a Panorama documentary called Trump: A Second Chance? It was broadcast on 28 October 2024, just days before  the US presidential election .\n\nLast week, the Telegraph  published an exclusive report , saying it had seen a leaked internal BBC memo.\n\nThe memo came from Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the broadcaster's editorial standards committee. He left the role in June, saying said he sent it in \"despair at inaction by the BBC Executive\".\n\nThe memo suggested that the one-hour Panorama documentary had edited parts of Trump's speech together, so he appeared to explicitly encourage the Capitol Hill riot of January 2021.\n\nIn his speech in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, Trump said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"\n\nHowever, in the Panorama edit he was shown saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nThe two sections of the speech that were edited together were more than 50 minutes apart.\n\nThe \"fight like hell\" comment was taken from a section where Trump discussed how \"corrupt\" US elections were. In total, he used the words \"fight\" or \"fighting\" 20 times in the speech.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, the document said Panorama's \"distortion of the day's events\" would leave viewers asking: \"Why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?\"\n\nWhen the issue was raised with managers, the memo continued, they \"refused to accept there had been a breach of standards\".\n\nThe BBC has received more than 500 complaints since the Telegraph's story was published, said the corporation's chair  in a letter to Dame Caroline Dineage , chair of the Culture, Media and Sports Committee, on 10 November.\n\n\"It has also prompted further reflection from the BBC,\" he said.\n\n\"The conclusion of that deliberation is that we accept that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action. The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement.\"\n\nThe Telegraph also made claims about BBC reporting in other areas of news.\n\nIt said Mr Prescott raised concerns about a lack of action to address \"systemic problems\" of bias in BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIn a letter to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee Shah said that action has been taken to address \"underlying problems\" in the Arabic service, including:\n\nReports also said Mr Prescott raised concerns about the BBC's coverage around trans issues, saying it was effectively \"censored\" by its specialist LGBT reporters, who promoted a pro-trans agenda.\n\nThis was again raised as an issue on Thursday when  the BBC upheld 20 impartiality complaints  over the way presenter Martine Croxall earlier this year altered a BBC News Channel script, which referred to \"pregnant people\".\n\nThe presenter changed her script to instead say \"women\", and the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit said it considered her facial expression as she said this gave the \"strong impression of expressing a personal view on a controversial matter\".\n\nDavie did not mention the Panorama documentary in his statement, although he said: \"While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision.\n\n\"Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made, and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility.\"\n\nPrior to becoming director general, he had been chief executive of BBC Studios for seven years.\n\nIn her statement, Turness said: \"The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.\n\n\"As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me - and I took the decision to offer my resignation to the director general last night.\"\n\nShe added: \"While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.\"\n\nTim Davie has weathered many scandals and crises during his five years leading the BBC.\n\nThese include:\n\nDavie was nicknamed \"Teflon Tim\" by some in the media because nothing seemed to stick.\n\nBut his resignation comes at a sensitive time for the BBC, with the government set to review the corporation's Royal Charter - which essentially gives it the right to exist - before the current term expires in 2027.\n\nThis appears to have contributed to his decision to quit.\n\nIn his statement, Davie said: \"You will ask why now, why this moment?\"\n\nHe said he was \"BBC through and through\", and cares deeply about the corporation and wants it to succeed.\n\n\"That is why I want to create the best conditions and space for a new DG to come in and positively shape the next Royal Charter. I hope that as we move forward, a sensible, calm and rational public conversation can take place about the next chapter of the BBC.\"\n\nHe added: \"This timing allows a new DG to help shape the next Charter. I believe we are in a strong position to deliver growth.\"\n\nPresident Trump  said top people in the BBC were quitting or being fired \"because they were caught 'doctoring' my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th\".\n\n\"These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election,\" he wrote. \"What a terrible thing for Democracy!\"\n\nDame Caroline Dinenage , the Conservative chair of the Culture, Media and Sport committee, said the resignations of Davie and Turness were \"avoidable\".\n\nHowever, she said Davie had been \"slow to react\" to the issues raised in Michael Prescott's memo, following a series of editorial crises over the summer.\n\n\"The BBC just seem to have dropped the ball at every opportunity,\" she said. \"And that's not a board-level problem, that's an institutional problem.\"\n\nDame Caroline rejected an  argument made by ex-Sun editor David Yelland  that there had been a \"coup\" by the BBC board. She said Davie did not stand down because the board asked him to, but because of an \"editorial failure\".\n\nMark Damazer , former controller of BBC Radio 4, said he welcomes debate about the BBC's impartiality,  but that it is \"absolutely wrong\" to say that the corporation is \"systemically biased\" .\n\n\"The notion that there is this widespread satisfied, smug, liberal, incompetent culture\" is \"wildly, wildly overblown\", he said.\n\nHe disagreed with ex-Telegraph editor  Sir Charles Moore ,  who told BBC Radio 4's Today programme  the BBC was \"always [reporting] from a sort of metropolitan left position. Absolutely consistently, that's how the bias is\".\n\nThe BBC Board \"must now begin the long process of rebuilding the corporation's reputation, both at home and abroad\", said Dame Caroline.\n\nThe director general is appointed by the BBC Board, which is responsible for ensuring it delivers the corporation's mission and public purposes.\n\nThe BBC Board is led by chair Samir Shah and he is one of 10 non-executive members, plus four executive members, including the director general.\n\nDavie's successor will be the 18th director general in the BBC's 103-year history.\n\nNames who have been rumoured as potential contenders in the running include Charlotte Moore, the BBC's recently-departed chief content officer who was in charge of all programming except news, overseeing hits including The Traitors, The Wheel and Happy Valley.\n\nOther names include Jay Hunt, one of the most experienced executives in British TV, and James Harding, the BBC's head of news from 2013 to 2018."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/8/cop30-climate-summit-hears-from-countries-suffering-global-warming-harms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"09:15:56+00:00","title":"COP30 climate summit hears from countries suffering global warming harms","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, leaders from nations most affected by climate disasters—such as Haiti, Kenya, Barbados, Jamaica, and others—are demanding urgent action, climate justice, and significantly increased financial support.

summit hears from countries suffering global warming harms\n\nLeaders from countries suffering some of the most catastrophic effects of the global climate crisis, from hurricanes, floods and more, have urged the United Nations climate conference in Brazil, COP30, to take action.\n\nWorld leaders are gathered on the edge of the fast-dwindling Amazon rainforest in advance of Monday’s official kickoff, with many focusing on  better balancing the gap  between developing nations and richer countries that produce most of the world’s harmful gas emissions.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has emphasised the need for a concrete roadmap to “undo deforestation, overcome fossil fuels and mobilise the resources needed”.\n\nAnother initiative aims to create a shared global carbon market, where those who produce less emissions than their required targets could potentially receive credit and sell it to those who overshoot commitments.\n\nRicher countries pledged $300bn to help poorer nations deal with the wide-ranging impacts of the warming climate at last year’s summit, but no money has been distributed.\n\nMoreover, developing countries and international advocacy groups maintain that the figure is  woefully insufficient to meet the needs , eyeing a goal of $1.3 trillion in various forms of government and private assistance.\n\nDuring the leaders’ meeting on Friday, Haitian diplomat Smith Augustin said  Hurricane Melissa  devastated his country, while small island states are the least responsible for climate change.\n\nKithure Kindiki, Kenya’s vice president, said “a previously once-in-a-century cycle of extreme droughts alternating with devastating floods continues to wipe out lives” in the East African country, which  experienced a deadly landslide last week .\n\nThe prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, said leaders at the summit must “hold our heads down in shame” as a loss and damage fund established in the 2022 conference in Egypt still has a capital base of less than $800m, “while Jamaica reels from damage in excess of $7 billion US, not to mention Cuba, Haiti or the Bahamas”.\n\nMahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chairman of the African Union Commission, said leaders from countries suffering the most harmful impacts of the climate crisis are not asking for charity, but for “climate justice”.\n\nSeveral leaders also criticised the United States, which under President Donald Trump has branded climate change a “hoax” and has refused to send an envoy to the talks while digging deeper into fossil fuels.\n\nThe UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said in its  latest report  earlier this week that it is “very likely” the world will exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) global warming mark – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – within the next decade.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the officials gathered in Brazil that they can choose to lead or be led to ruin.\n\n“Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation, with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress, and too many leaders remain captive to these entrenched interests,” he said.\n\nGuterres also said overshooting 1.5C is inevitable in the short term, “but what matters is how high and for how long”.\n\nThe UN says global emissions must nearly halve by 2030, reach net zero by 2050, and move to net negative thereafter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why

2025-10-23T08:09:33+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6nppg2kklo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:10:20.108+00:00","title":"Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla: Trial of ex-South African President Jacob Zuma's daughter starts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma, has begun her trial in Durban for inciting terrorism and public violence through social media comments made during deadly July 2021 protests in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.

daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma has pleaded not guilty to terrorism-related charges at the start of her trial in the port city of Durban.\n\nDuduzile Zuma-Sambudla is being prosecuted over comments she made on social media four years ago during deadly protests in South Africa following the arrest of her father.\n\nA week of anarchy in several parts of the country in July 2021, including looting and arson, left at least 300 people dead and caused damage worth an estimated $2.8bn (£2.2bn).\n\nZuma-Sambudla, 43, has been accused of fuelling this unrest and faces charges of incitement to commit terrorism and public violence.\n\nThe protests were concentrated in the provinces of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal and followed the former president's arrest for disobeying a court order to testify at an inquiry into allegations of corruption while he was in power.\n\nMs Zuma-Sambudla has always denied the charges against her, with her lawyer previously labelling the state's case as weak.\n\nShe has also repeatedly said the charges against her were an attempt to settle political scores with her father after he started his own political party and campaigned against the

She praised it as one that restores a cross-party spending process, including funds for food assistance and healthcare for military veterans.\n\n\"Weeks of negotiations with Republicans have made clear that they will not address healthcare as part of shutdown talks - and that waiting longer will only prolong the pain Americans are feeling because of the shutdown,\" she said.\n\nNew Hampshire's other senator, Hassan told reporters her constituents had been hit hard by the shutdown and were now bracing for an impending spike in healthcare costs.\n\n\"My vote today was to do two things: both equally morally important and imperative,\" she said.\n\nHassan spoke of the importance of a functioning government, \"so that our kids eat, so that our elderly citizens eat, so that our air traffic controllers can get some sleep and earn money, get paid while they are working, so that our veterans are protected\".\n\nMasto of Nevada had already voted more than a dozen times to reopen the government.\n\n\"We have federal workers that were suffering,\" she said after Sunday's vote.\n\n\"We have airport controllers. And we were seeing lines to our food banks in northern Nevada. These were lines that I hadn't seen since the pandemic.\"\n\nLike Masto, Fetterman has been voting to open the government since last month.\n\nThe centrist Democrat representing Pennsylvania said: \"After 40 days as a consistent voice against shutting our government down, I voted YES for the 15th time to REOPEN.\n\n\"I'm sorry to our military, SNAP recipients, gov workers, and Capitol Police who haven't been paid in weeks. It should've never come to this. This was a failure.\"\n\nRosen wasn't previously among Democrats who had been voting with Republicans to reopen the government.\n\nShe clashed with Nevada's Republican Governor Joe Lombardo after he wrote her a letter urging her to help end the shutdown.\n\nRosen said in a statement: \"The concession we've been able to extract to get closer to extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits is a vote on a bill drafted and negotiated by Senate Democrats.\"\n\nShe was referring to the fact that the deal approved on Sunday includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending healthcare subsidies that are due to expire this year - a key issue for Democrats.\n\nThe Republican leader of the Senate, John Thune, said last month he had offered Democrats a vote on the subsidies.\n\nIllinois's Durbin, who serves as the Democratic whip in the Senate, was the only member of the party's leadership who voted with Republicans for the deal. In doing so, he broke with the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"This bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown's hurt,\" Durbin explained in a statement. \"Now that Democrats secured these wins, it's time for Leader Thune to keep his promise to schedule a vote on the ACA [Affordable Care Act] tax credits in December.\"\n\nDurbin is retiring next year after three decades in office.\n\nKing, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, helped negotiate the deal to arrange a vote on tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, once the government reopens.\n\nHe has a track record of working across the aisle and had helped put together this compromise during meetings in recent weeks.\n\nKing said in a statement: \"The sum is we are closer to the possibility of work on the ACA tax credits for the people of this country than we were yesterday and than we were a week ago, two weeks ago, or a month ago. So this agreement tonight is a win for the American people.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9dpyevx3jo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"06:36:38.850+00:00","title":"Democratic divisions and other takeaways from US shutdown deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a 40-day government shutdown—the longest in U.S. history—the bipartisan Senate vote to approve funding marks a temporary resolution.

divisions and other takeaways from US shutdown deal\n\nWith a bipartisan Senate vote to approve funding the federal government now in the books, the longest shutdown in US history appears to be inching towards a resolution.\n\nIf the deal clears several more hurdles, we will ultimately see furloughed federal employees returning to work. They, and those who were deemed too \"essential\" to send home, will start receiving pay cheques – including back pay – once again.\n\nAir travel in the US  will return to a somewhat tolerable normal . Food aid for low-income Americans will resume. National parks will reopen.\n\nThe ordeals, great and small, that the shutdown had triggered for many Americans will end.\n\nThe political consequences of this record standoff, however, will linger even as the government returns to work.\n\nHere are three major takeaways now that an exit ramp has come into view.\n\nIn the end, the Democrats blinked. Or, at least, just enough centrists, soon-to-be retirees and at-risk politicians in the Senate to give Republicans the support needed to reopen the government.\n\nFor those who voted along with Republicans, the pain from  the shutdown  had become too severe. For others in the party, however, it was the cost of backing down that was unbearable.\n\n\"I cannot support a deal that still leaves millions of Americans wondering how they are going to pay for their healthcare or whether they will be able to afford to get sick,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement.\n\nThe way this shutdown is ending is sure to reopen old wounds between the party's activist and left-wing base and its institutionalist, centrist establishment. The divides within the party, which last week was celebrating electoral victories in Virginia and New Jersey, are sure to sharpen.\n\nDemocrats have been outraged over Republican-backed cuts to government programmes and reductions in the federal workforce. They've accused Donald Trump of pushing – and breaking – the boundaries of presidential power. They've warned that the nation is veering toward authoritarianism.\n\nThe shutdown, for many on the left, was a chance for Democrats to draw a line in the sand. And now that it appears the government will reopen with no fundamental changes or new limits on Trump, many on the left will feel this was a wasted opportunity. And they will be angry.\n\nOver the course of the 40-day shutdown, Trump took two international trips –  to the Middle East and East Asia . He golfed. He made multiple visits to his personal properties, including one to hold a lavish \"Great Gatsby\" style fundraising party at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nWhat he didn't do was push his party to compromise with Democrats. And in the end, that hard line paid off.\n\nThe White House agreed to roll back the \"grim reaper\" workforce cuts it had ordered during the shutdown.\n\nSenate Republicans promised a vote on government health-insurance subsidies. But a vote isn't a guarantee, and there's little that Trump and his team gave up on Day 40 that they wouldn't have agreed to on day one. The Senate Democrats who finally broke with their party to reopen the government said they had little hope of headway with Republicans.\n\n\"It wasn't working,\" said Angus King – an independent who sides with the Democrats – of the party's shutdown strategy. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, said that Sunday night's agreement was \"the only deal on the table\".\n\n\"Waiting any longer will only prolong the pain Americans are feeling because of the shutdown,\" she added. There's no telling what was going in inside the heads of Trump and the Republican leadership team. At times, Trump even seemed to vacillate – broaching the prospect of replacing health-insurance subsidies with direct payments to Americans or doing away with the parliamentary filibuster that gave Democrats their power in the Senate.\n\nBut Republicans ultimately stuck together and did a good job convincing just enough Democrats that they weren't going to budge.\n\nThis  record shutdown  may be close to ending, but the political dynamics that led to the standoff are still very much present.\n\nThe compromise legislation only funds most government operations until the end of January – just long enough to get the nation through the holiday season and a few weeks beyond. After that, Congress may be right back where they were when government funding ran out at the end of September.\n\nDemocrats may have backed down this time, but they didn't face any real political consequences for blocking the Republican funding bill for more than a month. In fact, Trump's poll numbers dropped during the shutdown and Democrats had an impressive showing in last week's off-year state elections.\n\nWith some on the left howling that their party didn't get enough out of this shutdown – and only a handful of party rank in file in Congress supporting this compromise – there may be plenty of motivation for further shutdown brinksmanship as next year's midterm elections loom. And with low-income food aid now secure until October, one particularly sensitive pain point for Democrats has been taken off the table.\n\nIt had been almost five years since the last government shutdown, during Trump's first presidential term. Chances are the next one will come much sooner than that.\n\nYou can also get in touch by following this link"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn51pn74l23o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:06:59.480+00:00","title":"Fight fake news and climate deniers, Brazil's Lula tells UN talks","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the opening of COP30 in Belém, Brazil, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva urged global leaders to combat climate denialism and fake news, drawing comparisons to former U.S. President Donald Trump's denial of climate science.

cry to COP30, President Lula again made thinly-veiled references to President Donald Trump who branded climate change \"a con job\" in September.\n\nThe two weeks of talks kicked off on Monday in the lush Brazilian city of Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThey take place against a fraught political backdrop and the US has sent no senior officials.\n\nOn Monday thousands of delegates poured into the COP venue in a heavily air-conditioned former aerodrome, some coming from accommodation in shipping containers and cruise ships moored on the riverside.\n\nMembers of the Guajajara indigenous group, in traditional dress, performed a welcome song and dance for assembled diplomats.\n\nAddressing the conference, President Lula said \"COP30 will be the COP of truth\" in an era of \"fake news and misrepresentation\" and \"rejection of scientific evidence\".\n\nWithout naming President Trump, President Lula continued, \"they control the algorithms, sew hatred and spread fear\".\n\n\"It's time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers,\" he said.\n\nSince President Trump took office in January, he has promised to invest heavily in fossil fuels, saying that this will secure greater economic prosperity for the US.\n\nHis administration has cancelled more than $13bn of funding for renewable energy and is taking steps to open up more areas of the US to oil and gas exploration.\n\nThat puts the country at odds with the majority of nations still committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green energy.\n\nThis backdrop has put the COP talks in a difficult position as nations aim to make progress on tackling climate change without the participation of the world's biggest economy.\n\nSome delegates fear that the US could still decide to send officials to undermine the talks. Other environmental talks collapsed this year following US pressure, labelled \"bully-boy tactics\" by some participants.\n\nAddressing officials in Belém, UN climate chief Simon Stiell initially struck an optimistic tone. He said significant progress had been made in the last decade to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases.\n\nBut then he took aim at \"squabbling\" between countries.\n\n\"Not one single nation among you can afford this, as climate disasters rip double-digits off GDP,\" he said.\n\nBrazil wants to use its presidency of the talks to secure progress on key promises made in previous years.\n\nThat includes moving away from the use of planet-warming fossil fuels, finance for developing countries on the frontline of climate change, and protecting nature.\n\nPresident Lula's centrepiece is a fund called the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) that Brazil hopes will raise $125bn to protect tropical forests globally.\n\nBut fund-raising got off to a slow start, particularly after the UK decided at the last minute not to contribute public money.\n\nNations are yet to agree on the conference agenda.\n\nCountries with competing interests are lobbying for new items to be added, including a plea from a coalition called Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) that includes Caribbean and Pacific countries at most risk from rising seas and rising global temperatures\n\nThe group called for the COP to discuss the long-held goal of keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C.\n\nBut in recent weeks even the UN has said it accepts that overshooting this temperature is \"inevitable\".\n\nLast week UN General Secretary General António Guterres told leaders in Belém that the failure to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C was a \"moral failure and deadly negligence\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m321r73g4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:21:30.773+00:00","title":"Trump pardons Giuliani and others accused of plot to overturn 2020 election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a move aimed at promoting 'national reconciliation,' U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned a wide range of allies and individuals accused of attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, including Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, and Kenneth Chesebro, as well as several 'false electors.'

challenge of cleaning up 'filthy' Johannesburg ahead of world leaders' arrival\n\nIn just under a fortnight, leaders from some of the world's major economies will gather in South Africa's economic heartland, Johannesburg, for the G20 summit.\n\nBut just a few kilometres from the spruced-up, highly secure venue is a city centre which the authorities are struggling to improve and keep safe.\n\nThey face major challenges in cleaning up more than 100 derelict buildings, many plagued by rubbish and open sewage, some of which have been taken over by criminal gangs.\n\n\"There's guns, there's drugs, there's prostitutes, there's everything here,\" said Nelson Khetani, resident of a building known as MBV1, located in Joubert Park.\n\nNeglect and a lack of maintenance have left vandalised communal kitchens stripped of their fittings, while overflowing human waste covers parts of what used to be the laundry area.\n\nMr Khetani told BBC Africa Eye that rooms in MBV1 had been hijacked – a phenomenon where spaces or entire residential units are taken over and controlled by criminals to collect rent for themselves and, in some circumstance, provide a base for illegal activities.\n\nThe BBC has located and confirmed that there are 102 derelict or abandoned buildings in the inner city, an area of about 18 sq km (seven sq miles), but other media reports have cited much higher figures. Some of these have been hijacked and are unfit for human habitation.\n\nThe state of the city was on the mind of President Cyril Ramaphosa when talking about the G20 summit to the city council in March.\n\n\"I found the city filthy,\" he said.\n\n\"It is a painful sight to go through the centre of the city… you have a number of abandoned buildings, buildings that have been hijacked, that are not paying your rates and taxes.\"\n\nJohannesburg Mayor Dada Morero said at the time that the city was \"ready to host the G20\".\n\nLast month, as part of a \"clean-up\" campaign across Johannesburg, the city council said the inner city had been \"targeted...  for the systemic removal of pervasive lawlessness, illegal activities, hijacked properties, and critical by-law infringements\".\n\nBut the challenges ahead of the world event are huge.\n\nA fire at one of these derelict buildings that killed 76 people two years ago was supposed to spur people into action, but it seems not much has changed.\n\nThe BBC visited another inner-city building, Vannin Court, where rooms were covered in dirt and strewn with litter. A strong smell of human faeces permeated the building.\n\nResident Sinethemba Maqoma told the BBC that council-owned Vannin Court had been hijacked, and that the city council had cut off the water.\n\n\"The municipality was angry about the crime from this building... that's why they took [away] the water,\" said another resident, Sinqhiwe Goodman Sithole.\n\nJohannesburg's city council did not respond to the BBC's request for comment about Vannin Court's water supply.\n\nThere is also no electricity supply, Mr Maqoma said, adding that they use gas and solar lights.\n\nThe lack of utilities means residents cook food using portable gas tanks to power stoves. But without water or fire extinguishers nearby, the fire risks are huge.\n\nCars abandoned in the building's basement were partly submerged in human waste that was overflowing into an adjacent alleyway. Litter was floating on top of this slow-moving sludge of sewage.\n\nMr Maqoma showed the BBC a dark, unsanitary bathroom with a toilet that he said he flushes by pouring a bucket of water down it.\n\n\"When you flush [the toilet], it goes through to the basement,\" he said.\n\nThe city's housing problems are not a recent phenomenon.\n\nSince apartheid and white-minority rule ended in 1994, many black and mixed-race residents moved from townships outside the city to the centre to be closer to their workplaces.\n\nThis large influx of people put intense pressure on the supply of adequate housing. Coupled with under-investment and the departure of many wealthy landlords, this led to many buildings falling into neglect, and some became havens for illegal activity like hijacking.\n\nJoseph, which is not his real name, is a former hijacker who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity. He said he was hired by local criminals to \"clean\" a building and then \"put posters and write 'flat to rent'\". But collecting the rent was not the main business.\n\n\"The main business about the building is cooking the drugs,\" he said. \"They cook nyaope neat. Many buildings, plenty of them here in Jo'burg - they've been hijacked like that.\"\n\nNyaope is a highly addictive street drug in South Africa, often containing substances like low-grade heroin, cannabis, antiretroviral drugs, and in some cases even rat poison. It can cause abdominal pain, respiratory issues and depression.\n\nJoseph said he was haunted by those who may have suffered as a result of what happened where he operated.\n\n\"Some of the time, when I'm sleeping, I can see people, I see people. People died in these buildings. People went missing. I'm sorry for the wrong path in my life,\" he told the BBC.\n\nJoseph said he had left the gang because he discovered other gang members were plotting to kill him, adding that he was relieved to leave his criminal life.\n\nBut he gave some insight as to one possible reason that the hijacked building was not cleared by the authorities: corruption.\n\nJoseph claimed that evictions were prevented by \"having a good relationship with [the] city council and police\", which was a \"matter of [a] cash\" bribe.\n\nWhen asked about the allegations of collusion with building hijackers, the City of Johannesburg's deputy director of communications, Nthatisi Modingoane, said the council had no \"physical\" or \"credible reports\" that suggested there was \"any wrongdoing\".\n\nWhen it came to cracking down on criminal activities in hijacked buildings, the spokesperson said there had been \"operations where we found people with drugs... [and] illegal weapons and those cases are currently sitting with the South African police services for further investigation\".\n\nMr Modingoane added that the council \"will intensify\" its operations tackling criminal activity in hijacked buildings and \"make sure that we clean the city\".\n\nThe Johannesburg police did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on bribery and intimidation.\n\nThe eviction of the residents of these derelict and hijacked buildings sounds like the simple answer to the problem.\n\nThat could lead to much-needed redevelopment. But it would be an expensive exercise and legally not straightforward.\n\nIn the first place, South Africa's constitution protects the right of people to have a home.\n\nThis means once a person is settled in a building and they can prove they have nowhere else to go, they cannot be forced out unless the state provides alternative accommodation.\n\nThis imposes a cost on the local authority, and moving people out of a building is expensive in itself.\n\nJohannesburg Central's sheriff, whose jurisdiction covers part of the inner city, said evictions could not be carried out on a larger scale or frequently because of financial constraints.\n\nSheriff Marks Mangaba's role is to carry out instructions from courts, which includes dealing with evictions from buildings once a property owner obtains an eviction order.\n\nLandlords - either private or state - must pay for moving people out once they have obtained that order. But Mr Mangaba said larger scale evictions were a \"very costly exercise, it's millions of rands\".\n\nBut even if the City of Johannesburg could afford to evict people in large numbers, it would create a mass homelessness crisis and the council would then have to provide accommodation.\n\nFurthermore, South Africa's Prevention of Illegal Eviction Act means that every eviction has to come with a court order meaning that attempts to move people can get snarled up in the legal system.\n\nBack in March, the president highlighted the importance for Johannesburg's hijacked buildings to be \"turned into living accommodations where our people can live lives of dignity\".\n\nBut for many residents here, that vision remains hollow.\n\nAt the MBV1 building, Mr Khetani said he had been living there since 2008 even though it was supposed to be temporary accommodation.\n\nThe city council had told him that there was no permanent accommodation \"to go and put us into\", he said.\n\n\"The city has no money and nobody cares.\"\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l104k4vxo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:55:49.073+00:00","title":"Trial for suspect of deadly Magdeburg market attack begins","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man named Taleb A., a doctor from Saudi Arabia, has gone on trial in Germany for a deadly attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg on 20 December 2024, during which six people were killed and over 300 injured.

2025-11-09T23:41:56.514+00:00\n\nTitle: ‘Chaos has gone’ - quiet streets on Texas border after Trump crackdown\n\nIn Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, the immigration debate has spilled into the streets, sparking almost daily demonstrations while immigration agents ramp up arrests.\n\nBut in El Paso - a city in Texas on the US-Mexico border - the streets are unusually quiet.\n\nA year after the BBC last visited the border to understand the impact of the migrant crisis on the border, sites that were once teeming with migrants lie largely silent.\n\nJust a few years ago, as many as 2,500 migrants once camped outside the city's historic Sacred Heart Catholic church. Many lined the streets sleeping on donated blankets, idling while they waited for food and water to be distributed by local charities.\n\nNow, only a handful of parishioners can be seen coming in and out of the church.\n\nThe same is true of a nearby park and of shelters throughout the city, where migrants once huddled to exchange their experiences of trudging through jungles and deserts or being detained, robbed or nearly kidnapped on their long journeys through Latin America to the border.\n\nThe influx prompted El Paso's government to declare a state of emergency in late 2022 as local shelters ballooned beyond capacity.\n\nThen, when US President Donald Trump came into office in January - elected in part because of his promise to fix the border - the regular flow of migrants into El Paso slowed to a trickle.\n\nIt is a trend that has repeated itself along the length of the 1,900-mile (3,145km) border, from the Pacific Coast in California toTexas' Gulf coast.\n\nFigures for detentions of border crossers are at a 50-year low.\n\nIn September alone - the last month for which complete data is available - 11,647 people were detained along the entirety of the US-Mexico border, compared with 101,000 in September 2024 and 269,700 the same month in 2023.\n\nOne volunteer network, Annunciation House, once ran as many as 22 shelters throughout the region, catering in large part to thousands of migrants paroled into the US to await court dates, often years in the future.\n\nThere are now only two. The relative trickle of migrants - 15 to 20 in each location on a given night - is composed, in part, of those headed back home after years in the US.\n\n\"We have people who entered and were given employment authorisation, or temporary protected status that Trump has taken away, and they can't renew their employment. Then they can't pay rent,\" Annunciation House director Ruben Garcia told the BBC.\n\nOthers, he added, are simply in need of a place to stay while \"they can do the logistics\" of leaving the country.\n\nFor some along the border, the new reality comes as a relief.\n\nDemesio Guerrero, a naturalised US citizen originally from Mexico who lives in eastern Texas, described the border as \"chaos everywhere\" under the Biden administration.\n\n\"There were encampments everywhere along the border, with women, children and old people,\" he said. \"It was totally out of control.\"\n\nThat chaos had now gone, he said, because Trump had a vision for how to fix the problem and did it. \"He did what he had to do, where he had to do it.\"\n\nFor six straight months, administration officials say, not a single undocumented migrant who was arrested was released into the US. Many have been deported, while others remain in immigration detention.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem often declare that, for the first time in US history, the government has full \"operational control\" of the border.\n\nFor the White House, the figures represent a victory - fufilling a campaign promise that the president himself has touted as the one that led him back to the White House for a second term at a time when many Americans were concerned that Joe Biden had lost control.\n\n\"So far, this strategy has proven to be wildly successful,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the BBC. \"We're undoing the pro-illegal immigration policies from the Biden administration that allowed countless illegals into the country. We've secured the border.\"\n\nThe reasons for the low figures - which began falling in Biden's last year in office and rapidly accelerated under Trump - are complex.\n\nOfficials and experts point to a range of factors, including a Mexican crackdown on migrant flows north, the end of most humanitarian parole programmes, much tighter asylum restrictions and increased surveillance with the help of the US military.\n\nTrump's deportation drive in the US interior has also served as a deterrent to would-be migrants.\n\n\"Not many people are crossing the border, and not that many are even trying,\" one undocumented immigrant, who asked to remain anonymous, said.\n\n\"With Biden, people knew that sooner or later they would be able to come across and stay. It's not like that now.\"\n\nSome Trump supporters living in El Paso said that at times they feared for their safety, and accused the Biden administration of creating an atmosphere that endangered both local residents and migrants.\n\n\"We didn't feel comfortable going out by ourselves anymore,\" said Lorie Randazzo, a lifelong El Paso resident and the president of Greater El Paso Republican Women. \"Almost as soon as Biden hit office, it got bad.\"\n\nIt's not that we don't want the immigrants coming in, she added, but only the best ones, the ones who want to work.\n\nElizabeth Amy Posada, an El Paso native and a former aide to the local Republican congressman, said there used to be \"death everywhere\", referring to migrants dying in the desert or in the Rio Grande, and those who fell victim to cartels.\n\n\"Everyone should be happy about this [border security], no matter what their political persuasion.\"\n\nBut for others, Trump's border security drive brings mixed feelings.\n\nMany local conservatives are sympathetic to the plight of migrants. Other locals, vehemently opposed to Trump, say they understand the need for stronger border protections and recognise the important role that federal officers play in their communities.\n\n\"We absolutely live in the grey area here,\" said Marisa Limon Garza, the executive director of the Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, an El Paso non-profit that provides free and low-cost legal services to immigrants and refugees.\n\nAccording to Ms Garza, the prospect of long-time residents being removed from the country is particularly galling to border residents, many of whom have family on both sides of the border or come from immigrant families that came to the US generations ago.\n\nWhile Trump and other officials have repeatedly said that immigration officials are going after \"the worst of the worst\", data shows that is not the case.\n\nThe Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse - which tracks immigration data - found that just over 70% of the nearly 60,000 people held at the end of September had no criminal record. Many have been in the country for years.\n\n\"Now what we know to be true is that some people are waking up and realising they got scammed,\" said Ms Garza, referring to locals who voted for Trump.\n\n\"Realising that they screwed their families, their loved ones, and their neighbors… and now have to wrestle with that.\"\n\nRoss Barrera, a 29-year-veteran of the US Army and a Republican who lives in Rio Grande City, told the BBC that most people in his small border community are broadly in favour of strong border security, given that legal travel and commerce across close-knit US and Mexican towns continues unabated.\n\nBut Mr Barrera added that images of harsh immigration enforcement raids across the US \"upset a lot of people\" and have caused friction.\n\n\"That upsets me too,\" he said. \"People are human. It bothers people that the lady who's been here 20 years is getting deported, or the dad who's been here 40 years is getting deported.\"\n\nOthers are more blunt.\n\n\"There's a lot of people that are having second thoughts about the way they voted,\" said Jesse Fuentes, an activist in Eagle Pass, another town that found itself in the middle of America's border battle in mid-2023.\n\n\"But people are afraid to say or do anything.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:52:35.841+00:00","title":"When will the US government shutdown end - and why did it happen?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States government entered a 36-day shutdown in October 2025, the longest on record, due to a deadlock between Republican and Democratic lawmakers over a federal budget.

Until it is officially over, many - but not all - US government services are   temporarily suspended, and around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay.\n\nAlthough budget confrontations are common in US politics, this one has been especially tense because President Donald Trump began drastically reducing the size of the national government as soon as he returned to office in January, and has threatened to use the current impasse to make further cuts.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats  could not agree to pass a bill funding government services past 1 October , when the previous federal budget expired.\n\nIn the US system, Congress must approve a spending plan to send to the president to be signed into law.\n\nRepublicans currently control both chambers of Congress. But in the Senate - or upper chamber - they are short of the 60 votes needed to pass the spending bill, which gives opposition Democrats some negotiating power.\n\nDemocrats wanted the bill to include an extension of expiring tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans and a reversal of Trump's cuts to Medicaid, a government healthcare programme used by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income people. They also opposed spending cuts to government health agencies.\n\nA stopgap bill designed to avoid the shutdown was passed in the House, or lower chamber, but did not clear the Senate. And so on 1 October, the US government shut down for the first time in nearly seven years.\n\nOn 5 November, the stoppage entered its 36th day, eclipsing the 35-day shutdown which happened during Trump's first presidential term in 2018/2019.\n\nEnding the shutdown requires the two parties in the Senate to find a compromise that Trump will sign, which they spent weeks failing to do.\n\nA deal aimed at ending the shutdown  finally passed the Senate on 9 November , paving the way for the record-breaking impasse to come to an end.\n\nIt followed a weekend of negotiations in Washington, after which a minority of Democrats joined with Republicans and voted in favour of an agreement.\n\nRepublicans - who hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate - needed the measure to clear a 60-vote minimum threshold.\n\nThe vote is only a procedural first step, meaning that there is no date set for the reopening of the government.\n\nThe deal will need to clear several more hurdles - including a vote from the House of Representatives - before federal employees and services return. But it was viewed as the first serious sign of progress after 40 days of deadlock.\n\nThe deal includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending healthcare subsidies that are due to expire this year - a key issue Democrats had been holding out for concessions on.\n\nBut the compromise legislation only funds most government operations until the end of January 2026 – at which point, Congress might find itself back where it was when government funding ran out at the end of September.\n\nNot all aspects of government   stop during a shutdown. Services   deemed essential continue as normal, but most staff are not paid until the government reopens.\n\nBorder protection and law enforcement staff, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and in-hospital medical care workers are expected to operate as usual.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare cheques are still being distributed, although benefit verification and card issuance work may be interrupted.\n\nMail is still being delivered and post offices are open because the US Postal Service does not depend on Congress for funding.\n\nMembers of Congress are still being paid, a convention that has been criticised by some politicians.\n\nOn the other hand, many flights have been cancelled or delayed because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are also expected to work without pay.\n\nThe Transportation Department  has announced the cancellation of thousands of flights at 40 airports across the country , citing controller fatigue. The air traffic reduction is expected reach 10% of all domestic flights and has already led to chaos and panic at airports for many travellers ahead of the busy Thanksgiving travel season.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of government employees deemed non-essential have been furloughed - temporarily put on unpaid leave.\n\nUS troops were on track to not be paid in mid-October  until the Trump administration identified funds to pay them . However, House Speaker Mike Johnson warned this was a \"temporary fix\" and future payments may not be made.\n\nMoney for Snap (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), commonly known as \"food stamps\", has also run out and been subject to a legal battle. Some 41 million Americans are enrolled in this scheme.\n\nThe deal passed in the US Senate on 9 November, which still has some hurdles to clear, would guarantee funding for the programme until September 2026.\n\nServices like federally funded pre-schools and institutions like the Smithsonian museums have been reduced or closed.\n\nSome major national parks and monuments across the country have closed,   including Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay Area and the interior of the Washington Monument.\n\nIn the past, lengthy government shutdowns were seen as politically dangerous to lawmakers and the current occupant of the White House, as they disrupted voters' everyday lives.\n\nHowever, this time, the White House has appeared more than happy to shutter large parts of the US government for an extended period. Trump has threatened to break with the past practice of returning government operations to normal, bringing spending back to previous levels, and paying workers retroactively for the shutdown.\n\nSince January, his administration has already slashed government spending and sacked many federal workers, testing the boundaries of presidential power. He has sought to permanently fire \"non-essential\" workers during the shutdown.\n\n\"We'll be laying off a lot of people,\" Trump said on 30 September, the day before the shutdown began.\n\nEarlier in October,  the administration's attempt to lay off about 4,000 workers  was temporarily blocked by a federal judge, but the White House is appealing against the ruling.\n\nThe administration has also warned that furloughed \"non-essential\" workers may not receive their unpaid salary after the shutdown finishes.\n\nBut the deal passed in the US Senate on 9 November - which must still clear the House of Representatives and receive Trump's signature - would guarantee that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown.\n\nThe impact of government shutdowns on the economy is typically limited and temporary - similar to the disruption caused by a hurricane or major storm.\n\nBut it still causes problems. Approvals for loans and permits are delayed, as are reviews of potential stock listings.\n\nBy one estimate, $800m (£614m) in new federal contracts are not being awarded each day. Unlike government employees, contractors do not receive back pay once the shutdown ends, and many of the companies are small businesses without other big clients.\n\nOverall, analysts estimate this shutdown will knock roughly 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points off economic growth for each week that it continues - about $15bn a week.\n\nBut those losses threaten to become more substantial - and harder to make up - the longer the shutdown lasts.  Analysts are worried the shutdown could hurt shopping and spending during the key holiday months of November and December.\n\nThere are also new possible economic factors in this shutdown, as Trump moves to fire workers or deny them backpay and cancels federally funded projects - all of which could extend or deepen any hit to the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, the suspension of key releases of economic data, like the monthly jobs report, has added to uncertainty. Without basic information about how the country is faring, policymakers could be at risk of committing grave errors.\n\nShutdowns over budgets  are a unique aspect of US politics .\n\nThey have become quite common over the past 50 years - with three taking place during Trump's first presidential term.\n\nThe last shutdown, which began in late December 2018, was brought about by disagreements over funding a wall on the Mexico border.\n\nIt finally ended in part because large numbers of air traffic controllers, who had been working for a month without pay, began calling in sick, as has started to happen during the current shutdown.\n\nAt the time, flight disruption quickly spread, and the shutdown came to an end shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  estimated that the 2018-2019 shutdown reduced economic output  by about $11bn, including $3bn that it never regained.\n\nBut shutdowns pre-date Trump.\n\nThe Republican Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his presidency in the 1980s - though all were relatively brief.\n\nFormer Democrat President Bill Clinton had a 21-day shutdown in 1995, while his fellow Democrat Barack Obama had a 16-day shutdown in 2013.\n\nDo you have questions about the US government shutdown?

that you're reading this article on, as long as it looks good and keeps working.\n\nBut the elements that power and run it are the subject of an escalating struggle between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - with African countries in the eye of the storm.\n\nThe African continent is rich in critical minerals and metals - like lithium, rare earths, cobalt and tungsten  - which are vital to making and running our personal tech. Such materials are also essential for everything from electric vehicles, to AI data centres, and weapon systems.\n\nChina has long been the  biggest player  in the global market for critical minerals and metals. It has significant reserves at home, and access to supplies from overseas thanks to major investment in foreign mining operations - particularly in Africa.\n\nBeijing has also built up a dominant position when it comes to processing global supplies, and it has rattled the US with the threat of curbing exports. That's lent added urgency to US moves to increase its access to critical minerals and metals, with African reserves seen as key to that mission.\n\nThis is so much the case that the US has actually quietly overtaken China as the biggest foreign direct investor in Africa,  according to the latest annual figures.  The US invested $7.8bn (£6bn) across Africa in 2023, compared with $4bn by China, according to the China Africa Research Initiative of Johns Hopkins University, which accessed official data.\n\nIt marks the first time since 2012 that the US had regained the lead.\n\nThis American investment is being led by a government agency called the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This was set up in 2019 during President Trump's first term of office, and it is not shy about saying that its mission is to take on Beijing. The DFC says on its website that it was established as a means of  \"countering China's presence in strategic regions\".\n\nWhat does this investment mean for African firms and countries who are beneficiaries?\n\nLast year Rwandan mining company Trinity Metals  secured a $3.9m grant  from the DFC to help develop the three mines that it owns in the country, producing tin, tantalum and tungsten.\n\n\"The US government has been very supportive of what we've been doing, to look at bringing that supply chain directly to the United States,\" says company chairman Shawn McCormick.\n\nTrinity now sends tungsten from Rwanda to a processing plant in Pennsylvania. It has also struck a deal to send Rwandan tin to a smelter in Pennsylvania.\n\nMr McCormick denies that the funding from Washington influenced the company's decision to send supplies to the US.\n\n\"This was not the US government who said to the CEO and I 'could you please get that tungsten to America?' It's our decision as players in the commercial market.\"\n\nTrinity is 5% owned by the Rwandan government, and Irish critical minerals investment firm TechMet is also a shareholder.\n\nMr McCormick adds that while some mining operations in Africa can use untrained workers operating in dangerous conditions, Trinity follows the highest standards.\n\n\"We have shown that there is a way to produce these materials in a conflict free, child labour free way that is professionalised, and that's paying taxes and respecting the community and the environment, creating jobs and opportunity\".\n\nSepo Haihambo is an economist, and former executive at banking group FNB Namibia. She says African nations must be assertive in standing up for their national interests when negotiating with US entities, and shouldn't expect any favours.\n\n\"To expect [the Americans] to show up and negotiate and propose clauses that are in Africa's best interests on Africa's behalf would be unrealistic,\" she says. \"So Africa really needs to prepare itself for these engagements and be really clear on what [outcomes] it wants.\"\n\nMs Haihambo adds that African governments should expand away from simple cash for minerals deals. \"There's an opportunity to look at different frameworks instead,\" she says.\n\n\"You could look at production sharing agreements, joint venture models, local equity participation. Ultimately that then creates an opportunity for African countries to create, maybe, sovereign wealth funds that can then invest into developmental areas like education, healthcare etc.\"\n\nShe also wants to see more processing of minerals and metals done in Africa, rather than simply exporting the ores overseas, as this would be more financially lucrative.\n\nOne US company that is building a critical minerals and metals refinery in Africa is ReElement Africa, a subsidiary of US group American Resources. ReElement Africa is  constructing the refinery  in South Africa's Gauteng province.\n\n\"It was extremely rewarding to realise that we could partner with countries in Africa to put refining facilities alongside the resource in the mining projects, so you could actually capture more value, upskill labour, build an economy around that zone, and lay the foundation for further industrial development,\" says Ben Kincaid, CEO of ReElement Africa.\n\nHowever, Prof Lee Branstetter, an international economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the US has missed a trick.\n\nHe argues that Trump's trade tariffs on African nations have reduced enthusiasm for the US across the continent at a time when some in sub-Saharan African nations have complained that Chinese investment is not benefiting local populations enough.\n\n\"Had the current administration not indiscriminately slapped tariffs on large numbers of African countries for no apparent reason, the United States would probably have been in a better position to benefit from African disaffection with Chinese  projects,\" says Prof Branstetter.\n\nGoing forward, the US and China may also see increased competition in Africa from others, adds Ms Haihambo. She points to increased interest in the continent by countries such as Brazil, India and Japan."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2w0pvg4wko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"06:01:04.675+00:00","title":"Tank interview: A hacking kingpin reveals all to the BBC","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the exclusive interview with Tank, the pseudonym of Vyacheslav Penchukov, a former cyber-crime kingpin who led high-impact gangs like Jabber Zeus and IcedID.

2025-11-10T06:01:04.675+00:00\n\nTitle: Tank interview: A hacking kingpin reveals all to the BBC\n\nAfter years of reading about \"Tank\" and months of planning a visit to him in a Colorado prison, I hear the door click open before I see him walk into the room.\n\nI stand up ready to give this former cyber-crime kingpin a professional hello. But, like a cheeky cartoon character, he pokes his head around a pillar with a giant grin on his face and winks.\n\nTank, whose real name is Vyacheslav Penchukov, climbed to the top of the cyber-underworld not so much with technical wizardry, but with criminal charm.\n\n\"I am a friendly guy, I make friends easily,\" the 39-year-old Ukrainian says, with a broad smile.\n\nHaving friends in high places is said to be one of the reasons Penchukov managed to evade police for so long. He spent nearly 10 years on the FBI's Most Wanted list and was a leader of two separate gangs in two distinct periods of cyber-crime history.\n\nIt is rare to speak to such a high-level cyber-criminal who has left so many victims behind him; Penchukov spoke to us for six hours over two days as part of the ongoing podcast series Cyber Hack: Evil Corp.\n\nThe exclusive interview - Penchukov's first ever - reveals the inner workings of these prolific cyber-gangs, the mindset of some of the individuals behind them and never-before-known details about hackers still at large - including the alleged leader of the sanctioned Russian group, Evil Corp.\n\nIt took more than 15 years for authorities to finally arrest Penchukov in a dramatic operation in Switzerland in 2022.\n\n\"There were snipers on the roof and the police put me on the ground and handcuffed me and put a bag on my head on the street in front of my kids. They were scared,\" he recalls with annoyance.\n\nHe is still bitter about how he was arrested, arguing that it was over the top. His thousands of victims around the world would strongly disagree with him: Penchukov and the gangs he either led or was a part of stole tens of millions of pounds from them.\n\nIn the late 2000s, he and the infamous Jabber Zeus crew used revolutionary cyber-crime tech to steal directly from the bank accounts of small businesses, local authorities and even charities. Victims saw their savings wiped out and balance sheets upended. In the UK alone, there were more than 600 victims, who lost more than £4m ($5.2m) in just three months.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, Penchukov set his sights higher, joining the thriving ransomware ecosystem with gangs that targeted international corporations and even a hospital.\n\nEnglewood Correctional Facility, where Penchukov is being held, would not let us take any recording equipment inside the prison, so a producer and I make notes during the interview as we are watched over by a guard nearby.\n\nThe first thing that stands out about Penchukov is that, although he is eager to be released, he seems in high spirits and is clearly making the most of his time in prison. He tells me he plays a lot of sport, is learning French and English - a well-thumbed Russian-English dictionary stays by his side throughout our interview - and is racking up high-school diplomas. He must be smart, I suggest. \"Not smart enough - I'm in prison,\" he jokes.\n\nEnglewood is a low-security prison with good facilities. The low-rise but sprawling building sits in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. The dusty grass verges surrounding the prison are teeming with noisy prairie dogs scurrying into their burrows whenever disturbed by prison vehicles coming and going.\n\nIt is a long way from Donetsk, Ukraine, where he ran his first cyber-crime gang after falling into hacking through games cheat forums, where he would look for cheats for his favourite video games like Fifa 99 and Counterstrike.\n\nHe became the leader of the prolific Jabber Zeus crew - so named because of their use of the revolutionary Zeus malware and their favourite communication platform, Jabber.\n\nPenchukov worked with a small group of hackers that included Maksim Yakubets - a Russian who would go on to be sanctioned by the US government, accused of leading the infamous cyber-group Evil Corp.\n\nPenchukov says that throughout the late 2000s, the Jabber Zeus crew would work out of an office in the centre of Donetsk, putting in six to seven-hour days stealing money from victims overseas. Penchukov would often end his day with a DJ set in the city, playing under the name DJ Slava Rich.\n\nCyber-crime in those days was \"easy money\", he says. The banks had no idea how to stop it and police in the US, Ukraine and the UK could not keep up.\n\nIn his early 20s, he was making so much money he bought himself \"new cars like they were new clothes\". He had six in total - \"all expensive German ones\".\n\nBut police got a breakthrough when they managed to eavesdrop on the criminals' text chats in Jabber and discovered the true identity of Tank using details he had given away about the birth of his daughter.\n\nThe net closed in on the Jabber Zeus crew, and an FBI-led operation called Trident Breach saw arrests in Ukraine and the UK. But Penchukov slipped through the net thanks to a tip-off from someone he will not name. And thanks to one of his fast cars.\n\n\"I had an Audi S8 with a 500-horsepower Lamborghini engine so when I saw the cops flashing lights in my rear view mirror, I jumped the red light and lost them easily. It gave me a chance to test the full power of my car,\" he says.\n\nHe laid low with a friend for a while, but when the FBI left Ukraine, the local authorities seemed to lose interest in him.\n\nSo Penchukov kept under the radar and, he says, went straight. He started a company buying and selling coal, but the FBI was still on the trail.\n\n\"I was on holiday in Crimea when I got a message from a friend who saw that I had been put on the FBI Most Wanted list. I thought I had got away with it all - then I realised I have a new problem,\" he says, an obvious understatement.\n\nHis lawyer at the time was calm, though, and advised him not to worry: as long as he did not travel outside of Ukraine or Russia, US police could not do much.\n\nThe Ukrainian authorities did eventually come knocking - but not to arrest him.\n\nPenchukov had been outed as a wealthy hacker wanted by the West and he alleges that almost every day, officials would come and shake him down for money.\n\nHis coal-selling business was going well until Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. President Putin's so-called \"Little Green Men\" - Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms - ruined his business and missiles struck his apartment in Donetsk, damaging his daughter's bedroom.\n\nPenchukov says that it was business troubles and the constant payouts to Ukrainian officials that led him to once again fire up his laptop and get back into the cyber-crime life.\n\n\"I just decided it was the fastest way to make money to pay them,\" he says.\n\nHis journey charts the evolution of modern cyber-crime - from quick and easy bank account theft to ransomware, today's most pernicious and damaging type of cyber-attack used in high-profile hacks this year, including on UK High Street stalwart Marks & Spencer.\n\nHe says ransomware was harder work but the money was good. \"Cyber-security had improved a lot, but we were able to make about $200,000 a month. Much higher profits.\"\n\nIn a revealing anecdote, he remembers rumours that started about a crew being paid $20m (£15.3m) from a hospital that had been crippled by ransomware.\n\nPenchukov says the news fired up the hundreds of hackers in the criminal forums who all then went after US medical institutions to repeat the pay day. These hacker communities have a \"herd mentality\", he says: \"People don't care about the medical side of things - all they see is 20 millions being paid.\"\n\nPenchukov rebuilt his connections and skills to become one of the top affiliates of ransomware services, including Maze, Egregor and the prolific group Conti.\n\nWhen asked if these criminal groups worked with Russian security services - a regular accusation from the West - Penchukov shrugs and says: \"Of course.\" He says that some ransomware gang members sometimes talked about speaking to \"their handlers\" in the Russian security services, like the FSB.\n\nThe BBC wrote to the Russian Embassy in London, asking if the Russian government or its intelligence agencies engaged with cyber criminals to aid cyber espionage, but received no reply.\n\nPenchukov soon rose to the top again and became a leader of IcedID - a gang that infected more than 150,000 computers with malicious software and led to various types of cyber-attack, including ransomware. Penchukov was in charge of a team of hackers who would sift through the infected computers to work out how best to make money from them.\n\nOne victim they infected with ransomware in 2020 was the University of Vermont Medical Center in the US. According to US prosecutors, this led to the loss of more than $30m (£23m) and left the medical centre unable to provide many critical patient services for more than two weeks.\n\nAlthough no-one died, prosecutors say the attack, which disabled 5,000 hospital computers, created a risk of death or serious injury to patients. Penchukov denies he actually did it, claiming he only admitted to it in order to reduce his sentence.\n\nOverall, Penchukov, who has since changed his surname to Andreev, feels the two nine-year sentences he is serving concurrently are too much for what he did (he is hoping to get out much sooner). He has also been ordered to pay $54m (£41.4m) in restitution to victims.\n\nHis view as a young hacker who started in cyber-crime as a teenager is that Western companies and people could afford to lose money and that everything was covered by insurance anyway.\n\nBut when I speak to one of his early victims from the Jabber Zeus days, it is clear his attacks did have a harmful impact on innocent people.\n\nLieber's Luggage, a family-run business in Albuquerque, New Mexico, had $12,000 (£9,200) stolen in one swipe by the gang. Owner Leslee still recalls the shock years later.\n\n\"It was just disbelief and horror when the bank called because we had no idea what had happened, and the bank clearly didn't have any idea,\" she says.\n\nWhile a modest sum, it was devastating for the business, as the money was used for paying rent, buying merchandise and paying staff.\n\nThey did not have any savings to fall back on and, to make matters worse, Leslee's elderly mother was in charge of the company accounts and she blamed herself until the theft was uncovered.\n\n\"We had all of those feelings, the anger, the frustration, the fear,\" she says.\n\nWhen I ask them what they would like to say to the hackers responsible, they think it is futile to try to change the minds of these callous criminals.\n\n\"There's nothing that we could say that would affect him,\" Leslee says.\n\n\"I wouldn't give him the time of day,\" her husband Frank adds.\n\nPenchukov says he did not think about the victims, and he does not seem to do so much now, either. The only sign of remorse in our conversation was when he talked about a ransomware attack on a disabled children's charity.\n\nHis only real regret seems to be that he became too trusting with his fellow hackers, which ultimately led to him and many other criminals being caught.\n\n\"You can't make friends in cyber-crime, because the next day, your friends will be arrested and they will become an informant,\" he says.\n\n\"Paranoia is a constant friend of hackers,\" he says. But success leads to mistakes.\n\n\"If you do cyber-crime long enough you lose your edge,\" he says, wistfully.\n\nAs if to highlight the disloyal nature of the cyber underworld, Penchukov says he deliberately avoided any further contact with his one-time Jabber Zeus collaborator and friend Maksim Yakubets after the Russian was outed and sanctioned in 2019 by Western authorities.\n\nPenchukov says that he noticed a distinct change in the hacker community as people shunned working with Yakubets and many of his alleged Evil Corp associates.\n\nPreviously Penchukov and \"Aqua\", as Yakubets was known, had hung out in Moscow drinking and eating in luxury restaurants. \"He had bodyguards, which I thought was strange - almost like he wanted to show off his wealth or something,\" he says.\n\nBeing ostracised from the cyber crime world did not deter Evil Corp though and last year, the UK's National Crime Agency accused other members of the Yakubets family of being involved in the decade-long crime spree, sanctioning 16 members of the organisation in total.\n\nBut unlike Penchukov, the chances of police collaring him or others in the gang seem low. With a $5m bounty out for information leading to his arrest, Yakubets and his alleged co-conspirators are unlikely to repeat Penchukov's mistake of leaving their country."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2eppqd2nyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:12:24.950+00:00","title":"Former French president Sarkozy released from prison after three weeks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from La Santé prison in Paris after serving just three weeks of a five-year sentence for allegedly conspiring to use funds from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi to finance his 2007 election campaign.

He was allowed just one hour a day for exercise, by himself in the wing's segregated courtyard.\n\nTwo bodyguards were stationed in nearby cells, which the interior minister Laurent Nuñez was due to Sarkozy's status. There was \"obviously a threat against him\", Nuñez said.\n\nSarkozy was president from 2007-2012.

thought to be a world-first stroke procedure using a robot.\n\nProf Iris Grunwald, of the University of Dundee, performed the remote thrombectomy - the removal of blood clots after a stroke - on a human cadaver that had been donated to medical science.\n\nThe professor was at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, while the body she was operating on while using the machine was across the city at the university.\n\nHours later, Ricardo Hanel - a neurosurgeon in Florida - used the technology to carry out the first transatlantic surgery from his Jacksonville base on a human body in Dundee over 4,000 miles (6,400km) away.\n\nThe team has called it a potential \"game changer\" if it becomes approved for use on patients.\n\nThe medics believe this technology could transform stroke care, as a delay in accessing specialist treatment can have a direct impact on the chances of recovery.\n\nProf Grunwald said: \"It felt as if we were witnessing the first glimpse of the future.\n\n\"Where previously this was thought to be science fiction, we demonstrated that every step of the procedure can already be done.\"\n\nThe University of Dundee is the global training centre of the World Federation for Interventional Stroke Treatment, and is the only place in the UK where doctors can operate on cadavers with liquid which mimics human blood circulated in the vessels.\n\n\"This was the first time that we could perform the whole mechanical thrombectomy procedure in a real human body to show that all steps of the procedure are possible,\" said Prof Grunwald.\n\nJuliet Bouverie, the chief executive of the Stroke Association charity, told BBC News the transatlantic procedure was \"a remarkable innovation\".\n\nShe added: \"For too long, people living in remote and rural areas have been deprived of access to thrombectomy.\n\n\"Robotics like this could rebalance the inequity which exists in stroke treatment across the UK.\"\n\nIn the experiment, fluid which mimics human blood was used in four different cadavers.\n\nThe subjects, who donated their bodies to science, died within the past three years and were then embalmed.\n\nBoth the Dundee and Florida procedures were carried out last month using robotics from the Lithuanian firm Sentante.\n\nWhile there have been remote thrombectomies carried out before on a  silicon model , a  3D printed replica  and  on an animal , this is thought to have been the first procedure on a human body.\n\nThe team now hope to take part in clinical trials next year.\n\nAn ischaemic stroke occurs  when an artery is blocked by a clot .\n\nThis cuts off blood and oxygen supply to the brain, and brain cells lose function and die.\n\nThe best treatment is a thrombectomy, where a specialist uses catheters and wires to remove the clot.\n\nBut what happens when a patient can't get to a specialist who can do the procedure?\n\nProf Grunwald said the experiment demonstrated a robot could be connected to the same catheters and wires a surgeon would normally use, and a medic who is with the patient could simply attach the wires.\n\nThe surgeon, in another location, could then hold and move their own wires, and the robot then carries out exactly the same movements in real time on the patient to carry out the thrombectomy.\n\nThe patient would be in a hospital operating room, while the doctor could carry out the procedure using the Sentante machine from anywhere - even their own home.\n\nProf Grunwald and Ricardo Hanel could see live X-rays of the body in the experiments, and monitor progress in real time, with the Dundee expert saying it took only took 20 minutes of training.\n\nTech giants Nvidia and Ericsson were involved in the project to ensure the connectivity of the robot.\n\nDr Hanel said: \"To operate from the US to Scotland with a 120 millisecond lag - a blink of an eye - is truly remarkable.\"\n\nProf Grunwald, who has won an award from Innovate UK for her work and is also the vice president of the World Federation for Interventional Stroke Treatment, said there were two main problems with a standard thrombectomy - a global shortage of doctors who can do it, and treatment depends on your location.\n\nIn Scotland, there are only three places patients can receive the procedure - Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh. If you don't live there, you must travel.\n\nProf Grunwald said: \"The treatment is very time sensitive.\n\n\"Every six minutes delay, you have a 1% less chance of having a good outcome.\n\n\"This technology would now provide a new way where you're not depending on where you live - saving the valuable minutes where your brain is otherwise dying.\"\n\nPublic Health Scotland said  there were 9,625 ischaemic strokes in Scotland last year.\n\nOnly 212 - or 2.2% of all patients - received a thrombectomy, while 1,045 people received medication to burst the clots.\n\nFor the rest of the UK,  only 3.9% of all stroke patients  received a thrombectomy in the year to March 2024.\n\n\"It feels amazing,\" added Edvardas Satkauskas, the CEO of Sentante, speaking to BBC News from the company's base in Lithuania.\n\n\"Sometimes, the future is way closer than we think.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crex1zp3213o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"06:06:14.738+00:00","title":"Fear among Syria's minorities after the fall of Assad","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After the fall of Bashar al-Assad, Syria's minority communities — particularly Alawites and Christians — are facing a wave of sectarian violence, with masked gunmen targeting former regime allies.

2025-11-10T06:06:14.738+00:00\n\nTitle: Fear among Syria's minorities after the fall of Assad\n\nThe killer came by night – a masked man on a motorbike who struck without warning and then sped away. It's become a familiar pattern in some corners of the new Syria in recent months, as the country's fragile unity is eroded by revenge attacks and sectarian killings.\n\nThe main targets are Alawites, the sect of the ousted Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad. But this time, on 1 October, the victims were Christians – Wissam and Shafiq Mansour, cousins who were both 39, and were as close as brothers. As they chatted with a friend over coffee and cigarettes, they were hit by a hail of bullets.\n\nThe killings happened in the village of Anaz in Wadi al-Nasara, or the Valley of the Christians – an area of rolling hills in rural Homs province in western Syria. Locals say the gunman came from the direction of a nearby Sunni Muslim village.\n\nSitting a short distance from Wissam's coffin, his father George, railed against the authorities, saying Christians in the valley had been left defenceless.\n\n\"Guns were taken from us but left in the hands of a rival (Sunni) village,\" he said. \"We want to carry arms against them. They don't know anything about religion or love or peace. Today it's Wissam, tomorrow it could be anyone.\"\n\nMany in the valley are feeling vulnerable these days. Before the regime fell, they backed Assad, and he backed them. Many Christian communities looked to him for protection. Wissam was part of a pro-Assad militia, defending his village. Some locals say that's why he was targeted.\n\nWas it a revenge attack, or a sectarian killing? We can't be sure, but nothing will bring Wissam back to his wife Leen. She bent over his coffin for a last goodbye, then slumped back, ashen-faced.\n\nHer husband and his cousin were taken for burial – their white coffins carried by black-clad mourners through streets brimming with grief. The crowd chanted \"Christian blood is precious\" as they passed the scene of the attack.\n\nThe community here is bound together by faith, and by fear that Syria's new Islamist leadership – which overthrew Assad in December last year - may not protect them.\n\nThe lone survivor of the attack doesn't intend to wait to find out. He was shot in the hand and broke his ankle making his getaway. He doesn't want to be named.\n\nAfter the fall of the regime, the 36-year-old had come back to Syria, from Lebanon, with high hopes.\n\n\"We all came back home,\" he said, \"wanting to start new businesses. But what we were promised about security, and a future for Syria, we do not see it. My dearest friends are dead. I will have to leave the country again. There are many extremist groups. I don't know where Syria is going.\"\n\nLess than an hour's drive away, in the city of Homs, there are almost daily reports of kidnappings and drive by shootings. We found a pattern of deadly attacks on Alawites, killings that happen quietly, and attract little response.\n\nThe city has plenty of battle scars; some of its bustling streets are lined with ruins and rubble. Having survived the war, some Alawites now wonder if they will survive the peace.\n\nDuring the Assad era, belonging to this sect – an offshoot of Shia Islam - could bring benefits.\n\nNow it's a curse, and for Shaaban Al Ezzeldin, 46, it was a death sentence.\n\nThe shopkeeper was shot three times on 28 September as he locked up the family business at night. Once again, the killer was a masked man, on a motorbike.\n\nWe meet his brother Adnan in a building owned by their family since 1970. He is bearded, wearing black, and weighed down by grief. Unlike many, he dares to speak out.\n\n\"People are being killed just because they are Alawites,\" he told me, \"no more, no less. My brother was loved by everyone in the area, by all our neighbours, by all sects. Some of our neighbours used to come to the shop and enjoy evenings with him. He never bothered or harmed anyone.\"\n\nHe says Shaaban used to sit and chat with security forces at a checkpoint right outside the shop. After the checkpoint was removed, he was shot dead.\n\nI asked why he thinks the checkpoint was taken away. He says he does not know and stresses the family are \"not accusing anyone\".\n\nAdnan says two other Alawites were killed on the same day as his brother, adding that the bloodletting has a purpose. \"What's happening right now is the seed for forced emigration,\" he says. \"It's just the beginning. Someone is trying to destabilise the situation, and oppose co-existence, though we have been living together for hundreds of years.\"\n\nHe hopes Syria's mosaic of religions and sects can hold together. But then he adds: \"I lost my brother, and others lost their loved ones too. If we are all going to get killed, it's better we flee.\"\n\nSyria's interim government has promised to protect all its citizens, not just the majority population of Sunni Muslims. The country's Justice Minister, Mazhar al-Wais, says there will be public trials for those accused of involvement in large scale sectarian violence earlier this year.\n\nMore than 1,400 people were killed in March when government forces and allied groups were accused of carrying out summary executions, after an attack by Assad loyalists. Most of the victims were Alawite civilians.\n\nAbout 2,000 people - combatants and civilians — were killed in July in another outbreak of sectarian violence. Here too government forces were accused of executions. Most of the dead were from the Druze minority.\n\nThe scale of the recent killings is hard to assess. The attacks are usually isolated and often shrouded in silence. Many families are afraid to talk.\n\nBy cross checking information from local media reports, contacts on the ground and human rights groups, we estimate that at least 40 Alawites were killed in Homs in separate attacks between 5 June and 31 October. The dead included a student, a farmer, a taxi driver, a teacher killed in a grenade attack on a school bus, and another shot dead in front of her class.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) says there are escalating incidents of murder and kidnapping in Homs province, with Alawite-majority areas the most affected. Most attacks are acts of revenge, it says, against former members of the regime, or those suspected of collaborating.\n\nAlawites account for about 10% of Syria's population, but under Assad – the father and the son – they filled many roles in the military, security and intelligence agencies.\n\nWhether they supported the regime or not - and not all of them did – Alawites are now at risk.\n\nIn a modest home in a mixed neighbourhood of Homs, a pink-walled bedroom has become a shrine. A copy of the Quran rests on a pillow. School books and letters from friends are piled on a desk. This is where a mother – who does not want to be named - comes to be close to her beloved daughter. \"Her soul is still hanging over the place,\" she says. \"Her friends come every few days. No one fully grasps the idea that she is now dead.\"\n\nGhina, 14, was on the balcony of her home on 19 August when a gunman on a motorbike drove past and opened fire. She died in her mother's arms, surrounded by neighbours who had come to celebrate her exam results.\n\nGhina was \"the best of daughters\" her mother says, \"so smart, so good at school, addicted to studying, with so many plans.\" The teenager loved basketball, and wanted to travel and to study law.\n\nHer younger brothers no longer go to school. Their mother is too frightened to let them.\n\n\"Alawite families started leaving the area, they sell their houses and go. We thought it would get better (after the fall of Assad). They said it was liberation; people would live freely. Now we fear everything. We are scared when we hear a motorbike.\"\n\nGhina's face stares out from a large photo, her warm smile framed by long dark hair. \"She was smiling since the day she was born,\" her mother says. \"She loved life so much.\"\n\nHer mother does not speculate on who killed her. \"There are harmful people around,\" she says, \"they sow seeds of sedition. Probably they are not connected with the authorities or the state. I really don't know.\"\n\nBut she is sure of one thing – why her family was targeted. Was it because you are Alawite, I ask?\n\n\"Yes\", she replies, without hesitation.\n\nOn the same day we met Ghina's mother, another Alawite family were burying a loved one who had been abducted and killed. When we visited their home, they received us politely but were too frightened to speak.\n\nNo one has been charged with Ghina's killing. The killings in the Valley of the Christians are also unsolved.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lana Antaki, Wietske Burema, Goktay Koraltan and Aref Alkrez."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykp36ewkzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"03:16:42.357+00:00","title":"Fung-wong: More than a million evacuated as typhoon passes Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, a weakened super typhoon, made landfall in Aurora province on Luzon, Philippines, after a period of high alert and mass evacuation of about 1.4 million people.

head to Taiwan, after leaving two people dead in the Philippines.\n\nSome 1.4 million in the Philippines had been preemptively evacuated before Fung-wong made landfall on Sunday as a super typhoon, carrying winds of 185km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph).\n\nIt hit Aurora province in Luzon - the country's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT) and weakened to a typhoon hours later.\n\nFung-wong comes days after earlier storm Kalmaegi left nearly 200 people dead. Philippine authorities are reporting less severe damage than expected - though a number of communities are still cut off by the floods.\n\nBy daybreak, the winds from Typhoon Fung-wong which had howled all night had died down, and people came out to see the damage.\n\nThere was plenty of damage to buildings, but good preparation appears to have prevented a repeat of the casualties seen after Kalmaegi hit the central Philippines last week.\n\nThe country's meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and \"high risk of life-threatening\" storm surges from the \"very intense\" typhoon.\n\nHundreds of flights were cancelled, buildings were secured and residents in low-lying and coastal areas had been urged to move to higher ground.\n\nAt a shelter in central Aurora, parents brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013.\n\n\"We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,\" Jessa Zurbano had earlier told the BBC.\n\nAnother evacuee Patry Azul said: \"Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe.\"\n\nThe winds Fung-wong brought were not as strong as in some previous storms, and its destructive power quickly weakened after it made landfall.\n\nTwo deaths were reported, according to the civil defence office: one person drowned, while another woman was found dead under debris in Catbalogan City. Two others were injured.\n\nStill, many neighbourhoods have been flooded, and some are now isolated from the rest of the country after roads and bridges were cut by the high water levels.\n\nAurora officials told local media on Monday that four towns have been blocked.\n\nPower is down in much of the main island of Luzon.\n\nThe Filipino government had declared a state of calamity across the country in preparation for Typhoon Fung-wong and in the wake of Kalmaegi.\n\nThis gives government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services.\n\nKalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year, left at least 204 people dead in the Philippines, while more than 100 are missing.\n\nFive people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.\n\nThe Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones.\n\nAbout 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly.\n\nClimate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.\n\nHowever, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change -  have the potential to make those that do form even more intense .

Exiled Church figure Hilarion hits back at claims of spying\n\n\"I have never worked for any intelligence [agency], be it Russian or any other. I have never had any tasks or duties or requests on their part,\" says the former head of foreign relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion.\n\nHilarion has broken his silence after a series of allegations levelled against him by a former aide.\n\n\"Working for the Church is not compatible with working for intelligence. Those are two very different allegiances,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMetropolitan Hilarion was for many years a high-flyer in the Church and seen as likely successor to Patriarch Kirill. He fell from grace very quickly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and was sent into exile in Hungary.\n\nNo reason was ever given but close observers of the Orthodox Church were in little doubt. Patriarch Kirill warmly embraced Vladimir Putin's war, but Hilarion neither blessed nor opposed it.\n\nIn Putin's Russia, where criticism of the war is a criminal offence, such a stance from a top clergyman was enough to lose Hilarion his job.\n\nThe allegations against Hilarion began in June 2024, from 23-year-old Japanese citizen George Suzuki, who began working for him after his arrival in Budapest.\n\nThe former theology student accuses him of sexual misconduct as well as working for Russia's FSB intelligence agency.\n\nHe runs his own YouTube channel, and has posted further allegations using video and audio clips recorded in Budapest.\n\nSome of these, Hilarion says, have been doctored. He told the BBC he would refute each in turn in court.\n\nMetropolitan Hilarion admits mistakes in his treatment of Suzuki, but denies sexual harassment as well as spying.\n\nThese are difficult moments for a man who, during his 13 years as the Church's \"foreign minister\", engineered a rapprochement with the Catholic Church that led to a historic summit between Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill in Cuba in 2016.\n\nIt was the first meeting between the heads of the two Churches since the great schism of 1054.\n\nHilarion's case was given added urgency last week when the Czech government said it was considering imposing sanctions on him in response to the allegations against him.\n\nHis position on Russia's war in Ukraine has not changed.\n\n\"Any war is a tragedy, and the Church is always with the suffering people. That's as much as I can say.\"\n\nHilarion's supporters fear that Kremlin hardliners are now out to destroy him.\n\n\"Given the way Putin's regime operates, it would hardly be surprising if, in addition to his dramatic demotion in ecclesiastical terms, there had also been a determination to make sure that his reputation was damaged in whatever ways could be arranged,\" the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, told the BBC.\n\n\"The full facts remain unclear, but there is a Kremlin  modus operandi  that seems recognisable here.\"\n\nThe BBC has been in contact with George Suzuki. He alleges that Hilarion began sexually harassing him soon after his arrival in Budapest.\n\nHilarion denies harassment of any kind.\n\nAccording to him, in August 2023, his aide returned to Japan to visit his family, and returned to Budapest three weeks later \"a changed man\", tense, and unfriendly.\n\nHilarion also says that he has information that Suzuki visited Moscow the same month.\n\nAround this time a new character, Veronica Suzuki, enters the story - his aide's grandmother, who had taken custody of George Suzuki as a child.\n\nShe joined him in Budapest and stayed for weeks in luxury hotels, paid for by Hilarion.\n\nIn January 2024, George Suzuki suddenly disappeared, then wrote to Hilarion from Japan, pleading illness and family problems.\n\nHilarion offered to send €2,000 (£1,760)  a month, then received an email from Veronica Suzuki, demanding €384,000 - to be paid into her account, in exchange for destroying \"evidence\" her grandson had collected.\n\nHe reported her to the Hungarian police for extortion, then found that three expensive watches had been stolen, and cash worth in total €90,000 (£79,000).\n\nHe told police, and on the basis of fingerprints, DNA and security camera footage, an international warrant was issued for George Suzuki's arrest.\n\nThe stolen goods were later returned, but the former aide turned down Hilarion's offer of mediation to have the arrest warrant against him removed.\n\nIn June 2024, Suzuki began accusing Hilarion of sexual harassment, ostentatious wealth, and most recently, collaboration with the FSB.\n\nIn one video posted on YouTube, Hilarion can be seen getting into a bed where another figure is lying, apparently asleep.\n\nIn another, Hilarion fires a pistol in a shooting range which George Suzuki alleges belongs to the FSB headquarters in Moscow.\n\nIn an audio clip, Hilarion can be heard apparently warning his aide that things will go badly for him if he leaves his service and returns to Japan.\n\nIn his BBC interview, Hilarion says that he has evidence that the video and audio clips have been doctored, but refuses to go further.\n\n\"My lawyers advised me not to comment publicly on any material, be it textual, visual or audio, released by him or taken by journalists from [George Suzuki's] collection, before they are examined by the court.\"\n\n\"My first mistake was that I allowed him to come to Hungary,\" Hilarion told the BBC. He also regrets agreeing to the family's \"financial demands\".\n\nDespite what he describes as his ordeal, Hilarion remains loyal to the Russian Orthodox church, and to Patriarch Kirill.\n\nHe was investigated by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church and last December he was retired from his position as head of the Budapest diocese and transferred to the Church in the Czech city of Karlovy Vary.\n\nBut the Czech government's decision to consider imposing sanctions on him puts his future there in jeopardy and could force him to return to Russia.\n\n\"It is their liberty to decide who they want in the Czech Republic and who they don't want,\" Hilarion said. He would just like to talk to them before they do."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c205jvyg3wjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"00:09:19.390+00:00","title":"Do UN climate talks have a point any more?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article questions the relevance of the United Nations climate talks (COPs) in the face of declining global participation, particularly with key leaders such as Xi Jinping, Modi, and Donald Trump absent from the COP30 summit in Brazil.

that today seems like something of a relic.\n\nIn it, dozens of men and women line up in dark suits, in front of an enormous sign that reads COP21 Paris.\n\nRight in the middle the UK's then-Prime Minister, David Cameron, grins widely, as he stands beside the future King Charles III, just in front of China’s Xi Jinping. Far off to the right is the then US President Barack Obama, deep in conversation with someone who is cut off from the frame - because there were so many leaders lining up that day that it was difficult for the photographer to capture them all at once.\n\nWhat a far cry from the family photograph taken on Thursday with this year's line-up at the COP30 summit in Brazil.\n\nXi and Modi were no-shows, along with the leaders of around 160 other countries. And notably absent was the US President Donald Trump.\n\nIn fact, the Trump administration has exited the process entirely and has said it will not send any high-level officials this year.\n\nWhich raises the question, why have a two-week-long multinational gathering at all if so many leaders aren’t there?\n\nChristiana Figueres, the former head of the UN's climate process under whose leadership the Paris Agreement was struck, said during last year's gathering that the COP process was \"not fit for purpose.\"\n\n\"The golden era for multilateral diplomacy is over,\" agrees Joss Garman, a former climate activist who now heads a new think tank called Loom.\n\n\"Climate politics is now more than ever about who captures and controls the economic benefits of new energy industries,\" he tells me.\n\nSo, with carbon dioxide emissions still rising even after 29 of these meetings - which are, after all, aimed at bringing them down - will more COPs make any difference?\n\nOn his first day back in office, Trump used his trademark marker pen to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, the 2015 UN treaty under which nations agreed to work together to try to keep global warming below 1.5°C.\n\n\"This 'climate change' - it's the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,\" he told the UN General Assembly in September. \"If you don't get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.\"\n\nHe has rolled back restrictions on oil, gas, and coal, signed billions of dollars of tax breaks for fossil fuel firms, and opened up federal lands for extraction.\n\nPlus Trump and his team have called on governments around the world to abandon their \"pathetic\" renewable energy programmes and buy US oil and gas - in some cases with the risk of punitive tariffs if they don't. Japan and South Korea as well as Europe have agreed to buy tens of billions of US hydrocarbons.\n\nThe objective is clear: Trump says he wants to make the US the \"number one energy superpower in the world\".\n\nMeanwhile, he has set about dismantling his predecessor Joe Biden's clean energy agenda.\n\nSubsidies and tax breaks for wind and solar have been slashed, permits withdrawn, projects cancelled. Research funding has been cut too.\n\n\"Wind power in the United States has been subsidised for 33 years - isn't that enough?\" US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said when I asked him to explain the administration's policy when we met in September. \"You've got to be able to walk on your own after 25 to 30 years of subsidies.\"\n\nJohn Podesta, a senior adviser on climate to both Obama and Biden, sees it differently. \"The United States is taking a wrecking ball to clean energy,\" he argues.\n\n“They're trying to take us back not to the 20th Century, but the 19th.\"\n\nLast month, a landmark deal that would have cut global shipping emissions was abandoned after the US, along with Saudi Arabia, succeeded in ending the talks.\n\nMany supporters of the COP talks are concerned. What happens if the US path leads to other countries dialling down their commitments?\n\nAnna Aberg, a Research Fellow in Chatham House's Environment and Society Centre, describes COP as \"taking place in a really difficult political context\" given Trump's position.\n\n\"I think it's more important than ever that this COP sends some kind of signal to the world that there are still governments and businesses and institutions that are acting on climate change.”\n\nTrump's strategy puts the US on a collision course with China, which has also been working for decades to dominate the world's energy supplies - but through clean technology.\n\nIn 2023, clean technologies drove roughly 40% of China's economic growth, according to the climate website Carbon Brief.  After a slight slowdown last year, renewables accounted for a quarter of all new growth and now make up more than 10% of the entire economy.\n\nAnd, like Trump's America, China is engaging internationally well beyond participation in COP - it is taking its entire energy model global.\n\nThe split has transformed the climate debate. It is now one that pits the world's two superpowers against each other for control of the most essential industry on Earth.\n\nAnd it leaves the UK and Europe - as well as major emerging powers like India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil - caught in the middle.\n\nSpeaking at this year‘s conference, a source in government at a major developed country said: “Of all the things they're most terrified of, the biggest is being seen to criticise Trump.”\n\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned last month that Europe must not repeat what she termed the mistakes of the past and lose another strategic industry to China.\n\nShe called the loss of Europe's solar manufacturing base to cheaper Chinese rivals \"a cautionary tale we must not forget\".\n\nThe European Commission has forecasted that the market for renewables and other clean energy sources will grow from €600bn (£528bn) to €2 trillion (£1.74tn) within a decade and wants Europe to capture at least 15% of that.\n\nBut that ambition may come too late.\n\n\"China is already the world's clean-tech superpower,\" says Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Policy Institute. Its dominance in solar, wind, EVs, and advanced battery technologies, he says, is now \"virtually unassailable”.\n\nHe likens it to trying to beat the Chinese national team at table tennis: \"If you want to surpass China, you had to get your act together 25 years ago. If you want to do it now, you have no hope.\"\n\nChina produces over 80% of the world's solar panels, a similar share of advanced batteries, 70% of EVs, and more than 60% of wind turbines - all at phenomenally low prices.\n\nThe EU's recent move to raise tariffs on Chinese EVs reflects the scale of the dilemma. Open the market and Europe's car industry could collapse; close it and green targets may not be met.\n\nRestricting Chinese access to these markets may slow emissions reductions, says Joss Garman, but he argues, \"If we ignore questions about economic security, jobs, national security, that risks undermining public and political support for the entire climate effort.\"\n\nNow, with these shifts in direction of global politics and priorities, Anna Aberg says she expects COP to become an annual forum for \"holding to account\" countries and other organisations, something she believes remains an \"important role”.\n\nThe gathering in Brazil follows the acknowledgement by UN Secretary-General António Guterres that the 1.5°C target set in Paris will be breached - this, he has said, represents \"deadly negligence\" on the part of the world community.\n\nLast year was the hottest ever recorded, and 60 leading climate scientists said in June that the Earth could breach 1.5°C in as little as three years at current levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Yet more people are questioning the need for an annual gathering.\n\n\"I think we need one big COP every five years. And between that, I'm not sure what COP is for,\" says Michael Liebreich, founder of energy consultancy Bloomberg New Energy Finance and host of a green energy podcast, Cleaning Up.\n\n\"You can't just expect politicians to go and make more and more commitments. You need time for industries to develop and for things to happen.

In that decision, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to urge reconsideration of the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which recognized gay marriage nationwide.\n\nPolls show that same-sex marriage now has broad public support. More than three dozen House Republicans helped pass legislation in 2022 that required states and the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages.\n\nMary Bonauto, the lawyer who argued the Obergefell case before the Supreme Court, praised the court’s action. “Today, millions of Americans can breathe a sigh of relief for their families, current or hoped for, because all families deserve equal rights under the law,” she said in a statement.\n\nMs. Davis became a symbol of religious opposition to same-sex marriage after the Supreme Court’s decision in 2015. She spent five nights in jail after she was found in contempt of court for defying a federal order to issue licenses to same-sex couples.\n\nDavid Ermold and David Moore, a Kentucky couple, sued Ms. Davis after they had been refused a license and prevailed at trial in 2023. Ms. Davis was ordered to pay the couple $360,000 in damages and lawyers’ fees.\n\nShe appealed the judgment, claiming First Amendment protection from liability and asserted that the court had wrongly recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage and should reverse its decision in Obergefell.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled against Ms. Davis in March, citing a recent Supreme Court decision that found public officials acting in their official capacity are not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nPublic officials cannot “wield the authority of the state to violate the constitutional rights of citizens if the official believes she is ‘follow[ing] her conscience,’” wrote Judge Helene N. White, a nominee of President George W. Bush.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Chad Readler, a nominee of President Trump, quoted an earlier ruling that said Ms. Davis had taken “the law into her own hands.”\n\nMathew Staver, a lawyer for Ms. Davis, asserted that the Obergefell opinion was “egregiously wrong from the start” and said his organization, Liberty Counsel, would continue to work to reverse it.\n\n“It is not a matter of if, but when the Supreme Court will overturn Obergefell,” he said in a statement.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/podcasts/the-headlines/government-shutdown-vote-tax-cuts.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"06:00:06-05:00","title":"A Breakthrough Government Shutdown Vote, and New Tax Cuts for the Ultrarich","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global events, including a shift in the Senate's position on ending a government shutdown after Democratic defectors relented, tax cuts for the wealthy under the Trump administration, BBC leadership resignations over editing a Trump documentary, and severe water rationing in Tehran due to aquifer depletion.

not great when your defiant kid says you are wrong.\n\nIt’s a little bit worse when you are in the United States Senate and your defiant kid is running for Congress.\n\nStefany Shaheen is running for a House seat in New Hampshire largely on the strength of her family name and the legacy of her mother, Jeanne Shaheen, as the state’s former governor and now its senior senator.\n\nSo when the elder Ms. Shaheen negotiated to move toward ending the government shutdown without a Republican agreement to extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats have demanded, the younger Ms. Shaheen had a problem.\n\n“Clearly we had different approaches here,” Stefany Shaheen said in an interview on Monday morning. “I can’t speak for her. I think she did what she believes is right.”\n\nDemocrats are universally furious at the eight senators who helped broker the shutdown-ending deal without any concessions, as well as at the party’s leadership over a perception that it failed to stop the deal. No prominent Democrats have defended the deal. There are calls for political retribution and resignations.\n\nSupporting her mother’s vote would have left the younger Ms. Shaheen in a much weaker spot for her primary race to fill the seat being vacated by Representative Chris Pappas.

Plan to End Shutdown\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T16:48:42.141Z\n\nEight senators in the Democratic caucus broke with the party late Sunday to vote with Republicans and advance legislation to end the government shutdown.\n\nThe compromise measure that passed by a 60-to-40 vote came with a pledge from Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, to allow a vote in December on the Democrats’ main demand: extending health care subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year.\n\nBut many Democrats have said for weeks that such a promise would be insufficient to win their votes to reopen the government, because it was unlikely to pass in the Republican-led Congress. If the subsidies expire, it would significantly increase insurance premiums for millions of Americans.\n\nThree of the eight senators — Angus King of Maine, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada — have supported a Republican-written stopgap bill to fund the government since the shutdown began. On Sunday, five others joined them, paving the way for the spending measure to advance toward a full vote in the Senate. That drew anger and outrage from many of their Democratic colleagues who said the party should have held firm to protect the health care subsidies.\n\nThe compromise still needs to win approval in the Senate, pass the G.O.P.-controlled House and be signed by President Trump to bring the shutdown to an end.\n\nHere are the eight senators — none of whom face re-election in 2026, and two of whom are retiring at the end of their terms — who broke ranks:\n\nSenator Angus King of Maine: An independent who caucuses with Democrats, Mr. King was one of the lead negotiators of the deal. He said many “people are being hurt” by the shutdown, and that pain had pushed his colleagues to support a deal that would reopen the government without extending Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n\nSenator Tim Kaine of Virginia: Mr. Kaine said on Sunday evening that he was backing the deal after securing a provision in the temporary spending bill to reverse layoffs made during the shutdown and ensure that furloughed workers would receive back pay.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin of Illinois: The No. 2 Senate Democrat, who is retiring at the end of his term, Mr. Durbin underlined that the legislation advanced on Sunday night was different from the one voted down by Democrats 14 times over the course of the shutdown because it included the provision to reverse layoffs. “This bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown’s hurt,” Mr. Durbin said in a statement.\n\nSenator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania: For the 15th time, Mr. Fetterman voted with Republicans to end the shutdown. In a post on social media, he called himself “a consistent voice against shutting our government down,” and apologized to members of the military, food stamp recipients, government workers and Capitol Police officers “who haven’t been paid in weeks.”\n\nSenator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire: Ms. Hassan said in a statement that now was the time for Republicans to engage in “serious, bipartisan negotiations” to extend the expiring health insurance subsidies.\n\nSenator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire: Ms. Shaheen, who is retiring at the end of her term, said at a news conference that the legislation “is our best path” toward reopening the government and extending the health care tax credits.\n\nSenator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada: Ms. Cortez Masto said in a statement that while the government must extend the expiring health insurance subsidies, “that can’t come at the expense of the millions of Americans across our country impacted by a shutdown.”\n\nSenator Jacky Rosen of Nevada: Ms. Rosen defended her vote in a statement, while accusing Republicans of “weaponizing their power in alarming ways” during the shutdown. She cited the withholding of food stamp benefits and reductions in air travel.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/supreme-court-dreadlocks-prisoner.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:03:28-05:00","title":"Prison Guards Shaved His Dreadlocks.

The Supreme Court Will Decide if He Can Sue.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T05:03:28-05:00\n\nDamon Landor, a Rastafarian, was so wary of Louisiana prison officials that he reported to serve a five-month sentence carrying a copy of a legal opinion that found that inmates must be allowed to keep their dreadlocks, under a federal law protecting prisoners’ religious freedom.\n\nFour months into his term for drug possession, Mr. Landor, whose faith requires him to let his hair grow long, was transferred to a new prison. When he pulled out a copy of the court’s 2017 decision, a guard threw it in the trash, according to court documents he filed in a later lawsuit.\n\nThen, two guards handcuffed Mr. Landor to a chair, restrained him and forcibly shaved his dreadlocks.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday will hear arguments in a case testing whether Mr. Landor can sue state prison officials for money for violating his religious rights.\n\nAttorney General Elizabeth B. Murrill of Louisiana, who is defending the prison officials, nevertheless strongly condemned what happened to him in prison. So, too, did lower-court judges who ruled against Mr. Landor. But the appeals court said it was bound by past rulings banning such lawsuits.\n\nThe Trump administration and Mr. Landor’s lawyers have urged the Supreme Court to allow the case to proceed.\n\nThe Supreme Court has in recent years repeatedly bolstered religious rights. In 2022, the court sided with a Texas death row inmate who wanted his pastor to touch him and pray aloud at the time of his execution. The same year, the court said a high school football coach had a constitutional right to pray at the 50-yard line after his team’s games.\n\nWhen Mr. Landor was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center in Cottonport, La., in 2020, he handed a prison guard proof of his religious accommodations — the 2017 court decision, which said that the state’s policy of cutting the hair of incarcerated Rastafarians violated federal protections for religious exercise. At that point, he had not cut his hair for almost two decades and his dreadlocks fell nearly to his knees.\n\nMr. Landor, who is now growing his hair back and plans to be in the courtroom on Monday, has said his dreadlocks are central to his identity and religion.\n\n“When I was strapped down and shaved, it felt like I was raped,” Mr. Landor said in a statement last year. “And the guards, they just didn’t care. They will treat you any kind of way. They knew better than to cut my hair, but they did it anyway.”\n\nHe sued the warden and the guards under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, a federal law that requires states to protect the religious rights of individuals in state institutions.\n\nIn a separate case, the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that a related statute from 1993 — the Religious Freedom Restoration Act — permitted individuals to sue to “obtain money damages against federal officials in their individual capacities.”\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote in that case, Tanzin v. Tanvir, that “in the context of suits against government officials, damages have long been awarded as appropriate relief.”\n\nMr. Landor’s lawyers, led by Zachary D. Tripp, told the Supreme Court that the language in the two statutes was identical and allowed for the same monetary remedies.\n\nBesides, he wrote, the “‘stark and egregious’ facts here viscerally show that damages are essential” to protect religious liberty. Congress did not enact the law, he added, so state officials “could freely ignore it.”\n\nLouisiana’s lawyers told the Supreme Court that Mr. Landor could not “copy-and-paste” the rationale from the court’s 2020 decision involving federal officials to find a right to sue state officials for damages.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the same court that had ruled that the law protected Rastafarian prisoners’ dreadlocks, said it “emphatically” condemned Mr. Landor’s treatment. But the judges said they were bound by past precedent that did not allow such litigation against state officials. The statute Mr. Landor relied on was meaningfully different, the panel wrote, and did not authorize his lawsuit.\n\n“The same words, placed in different contexts, sometimes mean different things,’” a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit said, quoting an earlier Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe full 5th Circuit declined to rehear the case, but nine judges asked the Supreme Court to provide direction to the lower courts.\n\nJudge Edith Brown Clement wrote that Mr. Landor “clearly suffered a grave legal wrong.” Prison officials, she wrote, “knowingly violated Damon Landor’s rights in a stark and egregious manner, literally throwing in the trash our opinion holding that Louisiana’s policy of cutting Rastafarians’ hair violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act before pinning Landor down and shaving his head.”\n\nBut whether he can sue prison officials for money, Judge Clement added, “is a question only the Supreme Court can answer.”\n\nAdam Liptak contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/politics/us-boat-strike-deaths-hegseth.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:27:57-05:00","title":"U.S. Military Kills 6 in Strikes on Suspected Drug Boats, Hegseth Says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military carried out two strikes in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, killing six people on boats suspected of drug smuggling, increasing the total death toll to 76 from 19 attacks since early September.

2025-11-10T05:02:01-05:00\n\nIt was difficult to find the women, let alone broach such a delicate topic.\n\nWe’d been investigating a pattern of abuse of Kenyan women who had moved to Saudi Arabia to work as housekeepers and nannies. We’d become accustomed to accounts of stolen wages, rapes and beatings. Autopsy reports described burns, broken bones and mysterious falls.\n\nBut now, we were asking about something different. And we had to be cautious.\n\nVivian, working out of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, posted to a WhatsApp group for local mothers. The message was so unusual that she worried she might be kicked out of the group: Did anyone know a nanny or housekeeper who had given birth to a child who could not get a birth certificate?\n\nThe women, we knew, would understand what we were really asking: Did anyone know a mother who had given birth outside of marriage?\n\nAbdi, working in Nairobi, had heard stories about a community of Kenyan mothers who were trapped in Saudi Arabia because their children had no birth certificates, and therefore couldn’t leave. They couldn’t even be deported.\n\nHe met with Beatrice Nasimiyu, a mother of 4-year-old twin boys. She told us that she, like many others, had become so desperate to get her children out of Saudi Arabia that she had followed a bizarre rumor: She’d heard that the authorities would deport women with their children from a particular gas station. So she began living outside the station, by the road.\n\nVivian met a Kenyan mother named Catherine, who had come to Saudi Arabia as a live-in housekeeper in 2021. They talked for hours at a Burger King as Catherine’s 3-year-old son ran circles around them.\n\nCatherine said her employer restricted her access to her phone and confined her indoors — until she escaped one night. In Riyadh, she started dating a Kenyan man. When she found out she was pregnant, she cried for her baby’s future. “What will this life be for this child?” she remembered thinking.\n\nThese women’s cheap labor is a linchpin of the Saudi economy, enabling middle-class Saudis and foreign residents to hire live-in workers. Kenya’s politicians profit because they own staffing companies that send women abroad.\n\nOver several months, we pieced together a final cruelty in this system, one that leaves these women and their children abandoned by both the Saudi and Kenyan governments.\n\nDespite a decade of social transformation, unwed pregnancy is still a taboo in Saudi Arabia, and legally ambiguous. Some women are jailed after giving birth. Others say they faced no repercussions — until they tried to obtain identification documents for their children.\n\nOur investigation found that children of unmarried immigrants are frequently deprived of birth certificates, hindering their ability to access medical care and education — or leave the country.\n\nKenyan women and children suffer in particular, we found, because Kenyan Embassy officials berate them, stonewall them or saddle them with years of paperwork.\n\nAll had gotten pregnant or given birth in Saudi Arabia.\n\nVerifying their stories was challenging. Some women had no paperwork. Others shared their medical records and official correspondence.\n\nWe interviewed all but one in person, and whenever possible, we corroborated details using WhatsApp messages; contemporaneous photographs; and interviews with, or statements from, employers, colleagues, friends and relatives.\n\nFor example, in an unofficial day care, we found a girl named Precious whose mother had been deported without her. We traced her mother to a town northwest of Nairobi, viewed her correspondence with the Kenyan government and interviewed an activist who was working on her case.\n\nThe Saudi government told us these children were entitled to birth certificates. Yet it provides no public process for unmarried mothers to obtain them.\n\nOfficial procedures require verifying a “marital relationship.” One doctor at a women’s hospital said that, for an unmarried mother, the process would involve the police.\n\nSo, mothers turn to their home governments for birth certificates and travel permits.\n\nIn Riyadh, we contacted 15 embassies and asked how they address this issue. Even impoverished countries like Burundi provided more reliable help than the Kenyan government.\n\nKenyan officials, the mothers said, insulted and turned them away. The embassy required them to take DNA tests to verify maternity. Often the results never arrived. The Kenyan government refused to discuss this with us.\n\nKenya’s foreign minister, Musalia Mudavadi, told Parliament in April that he knew of 388 Kenyan children born in Saudi Arabia. Activists said the true number is probably higher.\n\nWe learned from diplomats that thousands of children from other countries are living without paperwork in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi and Kenyan authorities know about the children’s plight. Some live in the streets, visible to all. Mothers said they asked to be deported and were denied.\n\nUltimately, they were impossible to miss. We just had to look.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/giuilani-pardon-trump-john-eastman-sidney-powell.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:44:29-05:00","title":"Trump Pardons Giuliani and Others Involved in Effort to Overturn 2020 Election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has granted pardons to several individuals, including his former lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, John Eastman, Mark Meadows, Boris Epshteyn, Sidney Powell, and Jeffrey Clark, who were involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.

Giuliani and a wide array of other people accused of trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to the Justice Department’s pardon attorney.\n\nThe pardon attorney, Ed Martin, a lawyer who has long supported the rioters who were themselves granted clemency by Mr. Trump for attacking the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, posted a copy of the pardon proclamation on social media early Monday morning with a list of those who were covered by it.\n\nAside from Mr. Giuliani, the list included John Eastman, a conservative lawyer who advised Mr. Trump’s 2020 campaign; Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff; Boris Epshteyn, a top presidential adviser; and Sidney Powell, another lawyer who led one of the most far-fetched efforts to use the courts to reverse Mr. Trump’s electoral defeat.\n\nThe pardons, which only apply to federal crimes, are primarily symbolic. None of those named on the list are currently facing federal charges, and the pardons cannot shield them from continuing state-level prosecutions.\n\nEven though the pardons will have little practical effect, they stand as a reminder that Mr. Trump has often used his expansive powers to reward and protect his allies, even as his Justice Department has shattered traditional norms of independence from the White House by following his orders to pursue criminal cases against those he perceives to be his enemies.\n\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, called those who had received the pardons “great Americans,” claiming they had been “put through hell by the Biden administration for challenging an election.”\n\nThe proclamation announcing the pardons said they had been issued as a corrective measure to address “a grave national injustice” that took place when the 2020 election went against Mr. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. became the president.\n\nIt represented, among other things, the latest effort by Mr. Trump to sustain the lie that the vote count had been rigged against him in 2020 and to rewrite the history of Jan. 6, which he has repeatedly referred to as “a day of love” despite the violence that erupted against scores of police officers protecting the Capitol.\n\nBeyond Mr. Trump’s lawyers and advisers, the pardons covered several state-level officials who submitted so-called fake slates of electors to the Electoral College, falsely claiming that Mr. Trump had won the 2020 race in states that were actually won by Mr. Biden. Many of those officials are still facing prosecution on state charges.\n\nThe broad language of the proclamation, granting “full, complete and unconditional” pardons to everyone on the list, was likely to protect those named against any future efforts to bring federal charges related to the 2020 election. It could also cover many others who sought to challenge the results of the election, including members of Congress who took part in the campaign to pressure Vice President Mike Pence not to certify Mr. Biden’s victory.\n\nIt remained unclear why Mr. Trump issued the pardons now, more than five years after the election in question took place. The pardons were signed on Friday, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, but the proclamation appeared to be undated.\n\nStill, the move came amid growing frustration among Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters about lingering questions related to Jan. 6 and to a raft of other pardons sitting unsigned on the president’s desk.\n\nOver the weekend, many Trump supporters — including several of the pardoned Jan. 6 rioters — expressed disappointment that the administration had not yet responded to a report by the right-wing media outlet The Blaze that identified the person who planted pipe bombs near the Capitol on Jan. 6 as a former Capitol Police officer. (That report, based on so-called gait analysis, has not been substantiated by the federal law enforcement officials who have been investigating the pipe bomb case for years.)\n\nOther Jan. 6 defendants and their lawyers have raised separate complaints, saying that the Justice Department has been blocking efforts to grant the pardoned rioters some form of financial compensation.\n\nMr. Giuliani, Ms. Powell, Mr. Epshteyn and Mr. Eastman have not faced federal charges in connection with the 2020 election. But they were identified — albeit not by name — as unindicted co-conspirators in the federal case filed in 2023 by Jack Smith, the special counsel, accusing Mr. Trump of interlocking conspiracies to reverse his defeat to Mr. Biden and to interrupt the transfer of presidential power.\n\nAnother person Mr. Trump pardoned, Jeffrey Clark, a former top official at the Justice Department who helped him push the narrative that the election had been stolen, was also named as an unindicted co-conspirator in Mr. Smith’s case. But he was ultimately dropped from the indictment after the Supreme Court ruled that he could not face criminal penalties as part of its decision granting Mr. Trump broad immunity from prosecution for acts he undertook in his official role as president.\n\nMr. Giuliani, the president’s former lawyer and confidant, was a leading voice in efforts to invalidate the results of the 2020 election. He traveled the country sowing doubt about the results and making widespread statements that the election had been “stolen” from Mr. Trump and that Mr. Biden’s victory was fraudulent.\n\nMr. Giuliani has faced many legal troubles relating to his false and misleading statements surrounding the 2020 election. In 2024, he was disbarred from practicing law in New York by a judge who said he had “baselessly attacked and undermined the integrity of this country’s electoral process.”\n\nIn 2023, Mr. Giuliani was found guilty of defaming two poll workers in Georgia, whom he falsely accused of trying to steal the election from Mr. Trump. The women, who said they endured a torrent of abuse and threats of violence, were later awarded $148 million. The verdict prompted Mr. Giuliani to file for bankruptcy, but his claim was dismissed after a court said he had refused to comply with his reporting requirements.\n\nHe and Ms. Powell settled separate lawsuits with Dominion Voting Systems, an election technology company that Mr. Giuliani falsely claimed had plotted to flip votes in favor of Mr. Biden.\n\nMs. Powell was penalized by a federal judge in 2021 for her role in filing multiple lawsuits asserting that a cabal of “deep-state” operatives aided by Venezuelan intelligence agents and the financier George Soros stole the election from Mr. Trump by hacking into Dominion voting machines. In the judge’s ruling imposing the sanctions, she accused Ms. Powell and other lawyers of “a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process.”\n\nMr. Giuliani, Mr. Epshteyn, Mr. Meadows and Mr. Eastman are still facing state election interference charges in Arizona, where prosecutors said they were part of a scheme that sought to falsely declare Mr. Trump the winner of that state’s 2020 presidential contest. Part of the effort involved putting pressure on local election officials in Arizona to change results to favor Mr. Trump, prosecutors said.\n\nThat case, however, remains in a kind of legal limbo.\n\nAli Watkins and Ashley Ahn contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/climate/cop30-belem-climate-energy-technology-china.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:15:55-05:00","title":"A Flood of Green Tech From China Is Upending Global Climate Politics","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As global climate action falters in the U.S. and Europe, developing nations like Brazil, India, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Nepal, Nigeria, and Morocco are rapidly advancing renewable energy and electric transportation.

The Trump administration has blasted him. How did Fatih Birol get so big?\n\nBy Max Bearak\n\nReporting from Washington and New York\n\nAround lunchtime on the day we met, Fatih Birol, a soft-spoken Turkish energy economist, retreated to his hotel room to scarf down two hard-boiled eggs and a banana in front of his computer.\n\nMr. Birol was, in his typically humble way, preparing for a meeting with potentially far-reaching consequences. The organization that he has led out of obscurity over the past decade, the International Energy Agency, had just come under withering attack by the Trump administration.\n\nHe was about to sit down with the U.S. energy secretary, Chris Wright, who had just publicly blasted the I.E.A. as “nonsensical” for predicting that fossil-fuel demand would soon begin to shrink globally. Republicans were threatening to cut the U.S. government’s substantial funding to the I.E.A. if it didn’t change its tune.\n\nThe fact that the meeting was held at all shows just how much influence the I.E.A. has gained under Mr. Birol’s tenure. A decade ago, he told me, he probably would have met Mr. Wright’s assistant’s assistant. Now, he was playing a verbal game of tug of war with the U.S. government.\n\nMr. Birol likes to joke that he is “the world’s most boring man.” He certainly exudes a kind of bureaucratic plainness. But he has also deftly led the I.E.A. through a decade during which energy has re-emerged as a geopolitical weapon. The debate over how to address climate change is upending economic and diplomatic relations around the world — right as the Trump administration works to reverse a global push for a transition to renewable energy by producing, consuming and exporting as much fossil fuel as it can.\n\nMr. Birol, for his part, has repeatedly offered the fossil fuel industry a kind of “adapt or fail” warning, particularly as solar power grows at a pace that even the I.E.A. underestimated.\n\nJustin Trudeau\n\nFormer prime\n\nminister, Canada\n\nPrime minister,\n\nNarendra Modi\n\nPrime minister,\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n\nEuropean Commission\n\nJoseph R.

Director Is Said to Have Made a Pledge to Head of MI5, Then Broken It\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T11:41:55-05:00\n\nAt a secret gathering in May south of London, the head of Britain’s domestic security service asked Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, for help.\n\nBritish security officials rely on the bureau for high-tech surveillance tools — the kind they might need to monitor a new embassy that China wants to build near the Tower of London. The head of MI5, Ken McCallum, asked Mr. Patel to protect the job of an F.B.I. agent based in London who dealt with that technology, according to several current and former U.S. officials with knowledge of the episode.\n\nMr. Patel agreed to find funding to keep the posting, the officials said. But the job had already been slated to disappear as the White House moved to slash the F.B.I. budget. The agent moved to a different job back in the United States, saving the F.B.I. money but leaving MI5 officials incredulous.\n\nIt was a jarring introduction to Mr. Patel’s leadership style for British officials. They had long forged personal ties with their U.S. counterparts, as well as with three other close allies, in an intelligence partnership known as the Five Eyes.\n\nThe relationships among the organizations matter because many top national security officials view trust and reliability as paramount to sharing critical information with allies — vital for communication between agency directors, and hard to restore once lost.\n\nOn the same day in 1946 that Winston Churchill delivered his Iron Curtain speech in the United States, Britain and the United States secretly signed the pact that formed the basis for their intelligence alliance. It was an outgrowth of their collaboration during World War II. The partnership expanded during the advent of the Cold War to include other countries — Australia, Canada and New Zealand — earning it the name Five Eyes.\n\nAll rely heavily on American intelligence to help keep their countries safe. Though the F.B.I. is a criminal investigation agency, it is also a major part of the Western intelligence-gathering community. Alongside other U.S. agencies like the C.I.A., the F.B.I. has offices in embassies around the globe.\n\nMr. Patel’s inexperience, his dismissals of top F.B.I. officials and his shift of bureau resources from thwarting spies and terrorism have heightened concerns among the other Five Eyes nations that the bureau is adrift, according to the former U.S. officials and other people familiar with allies’ reactions to the bureau changes.\n\nFive Eyes officials have watched with alarm as Mr. Patel has fired agents who investigated President Trump and invoked his powers to investigate the president’s perceived enemies. The officials and others spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nThe shift under Mr. Patel has struck directly at the Five Eyes relationship through the removal of senior agents who spent years fighting Islamic extremists or blunting counterintelligence threats alongside operatives from allied countries.\n\nThe F.B.I. declined to comment on the director’s discussions with Mr. McCallum. A representative of the British home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, whom Mr. McCallum reports to, said her office does not comment on intelligence matters.\n\n“In all of my life — 32 years in the business — I have never seen a law enforcement or intelligence organization like the bureau be directed to go after people purely on political, vindictive reasons,” said Phil Gurski, a former analyst with Canada’s intelligence and cryptologic agencies. “In a Western democracy, that’s unheard of. It’s every day in Russia and China.”\n\nMr. Patel, who lacked the deep experience of his predecessors and is unabashedly partisan, has had a rocky introduction to his Five Eyes allies.\n\nOn a visit to New Zealand in July, he brought plastic 3D-printed replica pistols as gifts to senior national security officials, but they were illegal under local laws and had to be destroyed.\n\n“To ensure compliance with firearms laws, I instructed police to retain and destroy them,” New Zealand’s police commissioner, Richard Chambers, told The Associated Press, which previously reported on the episode.\n\nMr. Patel had gone to Wellington to open a new F.B.I. office, an initiative that former agents had questioned as the bureau faces budget deficits.\n\nMr. Patel also visited Australia, where he had suspended the bureau’s top representative in that country because she had taken a knee during racial justice protests in 2020. He later fired her.\n\nThe F.B.I.’s relationship with MI5 is arguably the most important in Five Eyes, a bond that dates back to at least 1938, when the two agencies investigated a hairdresser from Glasgow for providing military secrets to the Germans. The two agencies work closely on many operations.\n\nMr. Patel’s trip to Britain in May was the kind of gathering that top national security officials regularly attend, a conference with other Trump administration officials and their Five Eyes peers to discuss such issues as counterterrorism and cybersecurity. Organizers also set aside time for the principals to meet to discuss specific investigations and to get acquainted.\n\nHeld at South Lodge, a luxury hotel in the Sussex countryside that boasts Michelin-starred cuisine, the event was code-named “Gold Sycamore” by British officials.\n\nMr. Patel’s visit started awkwardly even before he arrived.\n\nSlated to land at Stansted Airport outside London, he sought to fly to an airport closer to the hotel. British officials denied the request, making clear that dignitaries must use Stansted for security reasons, according to one of the former officials and another person familiar with the interactions.\n\nThey said that during the trip, the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command of the Metropolitan Police told the F.B.I. that Mr. Patel’s security detail could not be armed. Britain has strict gun-control laws, and the police limit armed details based on risk assessments. The police assessment on Mr. Patel found he didn’t meet the threshold for an exemption.\n\nThe details for the heads of the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency were armed, another U.S. official said. That discrepancy prompted an emergency meeting between the F.B.I. and British security officials. The British officials held firm.\n\nAn F.B.I. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, denied that there had been a dispute over arming Mr. Patel’s detail. He acknowledged that the director had in the past pressed people on why F.B.I. details weren’t always granted allowances that other agencies got, but that he was seeking equal treatment for them, not for himself. The official also said the discussions about where to fly into involved a scheduling issue.\n\nThe conference had a detailed agenda. Mr. Patel complained about the number of meetings, one of the former officials said, a well-known gripe of his. The F.B.I. official said Mr. Patel did not object to meetings but rather was trying to figure out which ones were essential so he could fit in other important work.\n\nThe gathering was relatively informal, but even so, Mr. Patel surprised other attendees when he arrived wearing a trucker hat and a green hooded sweatshirt, the former U.S. official said. Mr. Patel frequently attends official events without wearing a suit, breaking with F.B.I. tradition.\n\nMr. McCallum, a Scot known for his discretion and mild manner who was close to Mr. Patel’s predecessor, Christopher A. Wray, was waiting.\n\nWhen Mr. McCallum asked Mr. Patel to keep the agent’s key position in London, Mr. Patel told him that it would not go away, and that money would be found to keep the agent in London, according to two of the former U.S. officials familiar with the episode.\n\nBut the funding for that position had already been cut before Mr. Patel left for Britain. It was not clear whether Mr. Patel was aware of this at the time he made the pledge to MI5, though his aides had been briefed beforehand about the cut, the two former officials said.\n\nMr. Patel ultimately refused to reallocate funding for the role because of the costs associated with it, according to three of the current and former U.S. officials.\n\nBefore leaving Britain, Mr. Patel and his girlfriend joined the other security and intelligence officials for a dinner at Windsor Palace with King Charles III, according to two of the former officials. At the end of the night, the group gathered for a photograph. Mr. Patel stood next to the king.\n\nAlan Feuer, Julian E. Barnes and Lizzie Dearden contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/politics/trump-affordability-inflation-democrats.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:47:20-05:00","title":"Trump Tries to Seize ‘Affordability’ Message","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the wake of Democratic gains in recent elections, President Donald Trump has intensified his focus on the issue of affordability, framing it as a core economic promise.

He vowed that should he retake the White House, he would tackle it on many fronts.\n\n“We will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,” he proclaimed at a campaign rally in Asheville, N.C., last year.\n\n“From today, and from the day I take the oath of office,” he added, “we will rapidly drive prices down and make America affordable again.”\n\nOver the past week, he could barely stand to hear the word.\n\nSince Democratic victories in elections last week on platforms that focused on bringing down the cost of living, Mr. Trump has angrily confronted the reality that he has lost ground on an issue that helped deliver him a second term.\n\nIn social media rants and in misleading claims about the economy, Mr. Trump and his cabinet have tried to wrest back a message of affordability that has buoyed Democrats and is resonating with an American electorate that is souring on his economic agenda.\n\nIn the days after the elections this month, the president struggled to craft a coherent and consistent message on the issue. He called affordability a “new word” and said that Republicans had not talked enough about it. He then blasted it as “con job” by Democrats. Eventually he declared, “I don’t want to hear about the affordability.”\n\nBy the end of the week, Mr. Trump was so perturbed by questions about the topic that he lashed out at a reporter and stopped a news conference with the Hungarian prime minister to have his press secretary come in and defend his record.\n\n“The reason I don’t want to talk about affordability — everybody knows it is far less expensive under Trump than it was under sleepy Joe Biden,” he said.\n\nBut in reality, Mr. Trump has mentioned the word affordability as much in the last week as he has in the past nine months. His renewed attention to the issue comes after weeks in which he faced mounting criticism for appearing out of touch with everyday Americans.\n\nThe week before the election, Mr. Trump was on a trip to Asia, showcasing his ability to broker trade and peace deals abroad, while thousands of federal workers missed paychecks and millions of low-income Americans were scheduled to lose food benefits. When he returned, he attended a lavish “Great Gatsby”-themed party at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nOn social media, Mr. Trump posted incessantly about the new Lincoln bathroom, remodeled in black and white marble with gold faucets and light fixtures, and on renovations at the Kennedy Center, which he said would be outfitted in marble and “magnificent high end carpeting.”\n\nThe posts provided fodder for Mr. Trump’s opponents, especially congressional Democrats, who for the past six weeks withheld their votes to reopen the government, seeking to prevent health care costs from skyrocketing for some Americans on the federal marketplace.\n\nEven as the Senate moved toward ending the shutdown without an agreement to extend expiring health insurance subsidies, many Democrats were vowing to make the cost of health insurance a defining issue in the midterm elections next year. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said on Sunday night that he would oppose the deal to reopen the government because it “still leaves millions of Americans wondering how they are going to pay for their health care or whether they will be able to afford to get sick.”\n\nAs Mr. Trump sought to recalibrate his economic messaging after the election, he claimed there was “no inflation,” that gas prices were almost at $2 and grocery prices were “way down.” To illustrate the point, he repeatedly pointed to a report from Walmart showing that the cost of a Thanksgiving meal would be 25 percent less than under President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n“2025 Thanksgiving dinner under Trump is 25% lower than 2024 Thanksgiving dinner under Biden, according to Walmart,” Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Thursday. “My cost are lower than the Democrats on everything, especially oil and gas! So the Democrats ‘affordability’ issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!”\n\nMr. Trump risks being in a similar position as his predecessor, defending his record by pointing to statistics that don’t capture a troubling reality that many Americans are feeling.\n\nThe latest government data shows that inflation persists, even ticking up slightly in the most recent consumer report. Grocery prices have risen since he took office. Experts are mixed on whether Mr. Trump’s policies have led to a drop in gas prices, which hover around $3 a gallon. And the Thanksgiving meal cost that Mr. Trump has cited come with a caveat: There are fewer items in this year’s Walmart bundle, analyses have shown.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that a majority of Americans say they are spending more on groceries and utilities than they were a year ago, and many blame Mr. Trump. A recent NBC News poll found that only 30 percent of voters believe that Mr. Trump has lived up to their expectations for tackling inflation and the cost of living.\n\nEven some MAGA supporters acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s insistence that the cost of living was coming down didn’t add up.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Georgia Republican who has grown disillusioned with her party and Mr. Trump on some issues, challenged the president’s narrative, saying in an interview on CNN that “affordability is a problem.”\n\n“I go to the grocery store myself,” she said. “Grocery prices remain high. Energy prices are high. My electricity bills are higher here in Washington, D.C., at my apartment, and they’re also higher at my house in Rome, Georgia — higher than they were a year ago.”\n\nThe White House continued to defend Mr. Trump’s record on Sunday, blaming Mr. Biden and the news media for the state of the economy. In a statement, a spokesman pointed to lower inflation, and cheaper eggs and Mr. Trump’s efforts to drive down prescription drug costs as evidence that the president was focused on affordability.\n\n“President Trump has been aggressively tackling Joe Biden’s inflation and affordability crisis since Day 1 of his presidency, when he signed an array of executive orders to lower energy and regulatory costs,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.\n\n“The president and administration will continue to deliver historic trade deals, investments, and economic relief for the American people — the Fake News media should try covering these initiatives and their results honestly for a change.”\n\nAnd on the television circuit, Mr. Trump’s cabinet members painted an optimistic picture of the economy when pressed about the issue of affordability.\n\n“Energy prices, gasoline prices are way down, and we are doing what we can every day,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I think we are on a very good path to bringing prices down.”\n\nKevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said Mr. Trump was making up for Mr. Biden’s failures. “So we see inflation under control, and the economy booming, but we understand 100 percent why people are still hurting, because we haven’t made up all the room that was lost under Joe Biden,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n\nBut some White House officials have acknowledged that Mr. Trump has work to do to convince the American people that he’s trying.\n\n“We need to focus on the home front,” Vice President JD Vance wrote in a social media post after last week’s elections. “The president has done a lot that has already paid off in lower interest rates and lower inflation, but we inherited a disaster from Joe Biden and Rome wasn’t built in a day. We’re going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that’s the metric by which we’ll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.”\n\nJames Blair, the White House deputy chief of staff, said in an interview with Politico last week that Mr. Trump would talk more about the cost of living in the coming months.\n\n“The president is very keyed into what’s going on, and he recognizes, like anybody, that it takes time to do an economic turnaround,” Mr. Blair said, “but all the fundamentals are there, and I think you’ll see him be very, very focused on prices and cost of living.”\n\nLindsay Owens, the executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, an economic policy group, said the affordability issue had clearly become “existential” for Mr. Trump. But she said it would take more than talking about it to convince voters.\n\n“I don’t think Americans’ attitudes toward the economy, and toward Trump’s sophistication on the economy, will change until the facts on the ground change,” Dr. Owens said. “It is his one strength that has now turned into a pretty considerable weakness, and we’re starting to see bumps in data that we haven’t seen in over 15 years.”\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump signaled that he was tuning into the growing frustrations.\n\nOn Friday night, he announced that he was directing the Justice Department to investigate whether meatpacking companies were engaging in “collusion” and driving up the prices of beef. On Saturday, he announced a proposal to reroute health care subsidies paid to insurance companies to Americans’ savings accounts. On Sunday morning he proposed doling out $2,000 dividends from tariff revenue — “(not including high income people),” he wrote.\n\nBut by Sunday afternoon, as he flew back to Washington to attend a football game after a weekend of golfing at his West Palm Beach resort, Mr. Trump’s attention was back on a project that has commanded his undivided attention.\n\n“The Main Entrance to the new Ballroom at the White House!” Mr. Trump posted on his social media account, with a picture of the progress of his newly decorated space.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/world/europe/bbc-resignations.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:33:05-05:00","title":"Two Top BBC Leaders Quit Over Editing of Trump Documentary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two top BBC executives, Director General Tim Davie and BBC News Chief Executive Deborah Turness, resigned abruptly over allegations that a Panorama documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?' misleadingly edited President Donald Trump’s speech to imply he encouraged the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

a report suggesting the public service broadcaster had misleadingly edited a speech by President Trump that preceded the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nThe surprise resignation of the director general, Tim Davie, and Deborah Turness, the chief executive of BBC News, came several days after The Daily Telegraph published details of a leaked internal memo arguing that a BBC Panorama documentary had juxtaposed comments by Mr. Trump in a way that made it appear that he had explicitly encouraged the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Like all public organizations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable,” Mr. Davie said in a statement. “While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision.”\n\nMr. Davie added: “Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility.”\n\nMs. Turness, in her announcement, said, “The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC — an institution that I love.”\n\nShe said that “the buck stops with me” and conceded that “mistakes have been made” but insisted that “recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n\nMr. Trump welcomed the resignations in a post on his Truth Social account.\n\nWith about 21,000 employees, the BBC calls itself the world’s leading public service broadcaster, and is funded primarily from a license fee paid by Britons who watch TV, supplemented by commercial revenue. It produces a huge range of material, from news to entertainment, and has reach outside Britain through its international broadcasting operations.\n\nPressure had been building on Mr. Davie and senior management of the BBC after the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, reacting to the leaked memo, accused the broadcaster of being “purposefully dishonest” over its depiction of the Capitol Hill insurrection.\n\nThe leaked memo was written by Michael Prescott, a former journalist who, until June, was an independent external adviser to the broadcaster’s editorial standards committee. The documentary, called “Trump: A Second Chance?” was broadcast last year and, in one section, spliced together footage from comments Mr. Trump made about 50 minutes apart.\n\nMr. Prescott’s critique also included claims that the broadcaster did not cover stories that raised difficult questions about transgender rights, and that BBC Arabic gave a platform to a journalist who had posted antisemitic comments.\n\nMr. Davie was director general for five years  and survived a number of other crises at the broadcaster, earning the nickname “Teflon Tim.”\n\nThis year, the broadcaster was criticized for having failed to cut away during live coverage of the Glastonbury music festival when the performer Bob Vylan led the crowd in chants  against the Israeli military.\n\nOfcom, Britain’s media regulator, ruled this year that the BBC had committed a “serious breach” of broadcasting rules by failing to disclose that the narrator of a documentary about Gaza was the son of a Hamas official. And there were controversies over the behavior of several TV stars employed by the corporation.\n\nThe BBC’s senior leadership was widely expected to issue an apology in front of a parliamentary committee on Monday over the documentary about President Trump, and Mr. Davie appears to have calculated that his position was becoming untenable.\n\nSome of the BBC’s senior staff have said they believe that the broadcaster is under attack from partisan opponents.\n\n“It’s clear that there is a genuine concern about editorial standards and mistakes,” wrote Nick Robinson, a presenter on Today, the flagship morning radio show, on social media. “There is also a political campaign by people who want to destroy the organization.”\n\nIn a statement issued after Mr. Davie’s resignation, Lisa Nandy, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, thanked him for his service, described the BBC as “one of our most important national institutions.”\n\nBut earlier on Sunday Ms. Nandy, in an interview with the BBC, said that decisions about the broadcaster’s editorial standards and guidelines, and the sort of language used in reporting, was “not always well thought through.” She added: “Often it’s left to individual journalists or newsreaders to make decisions.”\n\nIn a statement, Kemi Badenoch, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, welcomed the resignations but added that Mr. Prescott’s report “exposed institutional bias that cannot be swept away with two resignations — strong action must be taken on all the issues it raised.”\n\nOn social media, Ms. Leavitt reacted to Mr. Davie’s resignation by posting screenshots of two news articles, the first reading “Trump goes to war with ‘fake news’ BBC,” the second from the broadcaster’s own website on Sunday reporting “Tim Davie resigns as BBC director general over Trump edit.”\n\nAbove the first article, Ms. Leavitt wrote: “Shot,” above the second, “Chaser.”\n\nIn response, Ed Davey, leader of Britain’s centrist Liberal Democrat party wrote, also on social media: “To see Trump’s White House claiming credit for his downfall and attacking the BBC should worry us all.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/world/middleeast/syria-president-al-shara-trump-washington.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"06:54:27-05:00","title":"Syria’s President to Meet Trump at White House for First Time","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Ahmed al-Shara of Syria is set to make his first visit to the U.S. White House to meet with President Donald Trump, marking a historic moment in Syria’s international relations.

Mr. al-Shara has since redefined himself as a statesman while seeking to return Syria to the international fold and rebuild the country as it emerges from a long and devastating civil war.\n\nA World Bank report estimated the cost of Syria’s reconstruction at about $216 billion.\n\nSince taking power, Mr. al-Shara has toured the wealthy Gulf states to drum up international investment. In September, he went to New York and became the first Syrian president to address the U.N. General Assembly in nearly 60 years.\n\nThe next month, he visited the Kremlin and met President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who once backed Mr. al-Assad in his government’s fight against Mr. al-Shara’s rebels. They discussed developing Syria’s oil fields and other projects in the energy, transport and tourism sectors.\n\nBefore traveling to Washington, Mr. al-Shara joined world leaders in Brazil at an annual U.N. climate summit and invited investments in renewable energy as part of his government’s plans for reconstruction.\n\nMr. al-Shara has been embraced by Mr. Trump.\n\nIn December, the U.S. government dropped the $10 million bounty, and in July, it revoked the terrorist designation for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that Mr. al-Shara once led.\n\nMr. Trump has also pledged that Washington would lift all sanctions on Syria to support its efforts to rebuild. So far, Mr. Trump has granted Syria widespread exemptions on sanctions and pushed for Congress to repeal a 2019 law, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, which imposed the toughest sanctions on Syria.\n\nThere remains some resistance to doing so in light of concerns about Syria’s sometimes rocky transition since the Assad regime collapsed.\n\nOver the past year, there have been a series of deadly outbursts of sectarian violence, some involving armed groups that support Mr. al-Shara’s government.\n\nMr. al-Shara has also come under criticism for concentrating power in his own hands and those of a close circle of loyalists.\n\nBefore his visit to Washington, the U.N. Security Council voted on Thursday to remove Mr. al-Shara from a terrorism sanctions list, a move pushed by the United States. That step will allow him to travel more freely, without having to seek waivers for some trips.\n\nBy signing onto the coalition fighting the Islamic State, Mr. al-Shara is further bolstering his relationship with the Trump administration, analysts say.\n\nWhile the Islamic State lost its territorial foothold in Syria in 2019, it continues to have a presence in the country, and there are fears that it could re-emerge if Mr. al-Shara fails to stabilize and unite the country and consolidate his own security forces.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/09/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayoral-speech.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00Z","title":"National Response to Rare Disease Outbreak Begins","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A rare disease outbreak was detected in a central region of the country on April 13, 2024.

He hailed a new political power base, comprising Senegalese cab drivers, Ethiopian aunties, Yemeni bodega owners and Uzbek nurses. And he made little outreach to the more than 850,000 people who voted for former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, saying, “Let tonight be the final time I utter his name.”\n\nThough Mr. Mamdani’s campaign is rightly celebrated for its deft use of social media, he also outworked his competitors in old-school stumping, delivering 150 speeches between Primary Day and the general election. Julian Gerson, who wrote the victory speech with heavy input from the candidate, remembered Mr. Mamdani coming off a sunrise campaign march across the Brooklyn Bridge last Monday and sitting down to 90 minutes of revisions — adding references to neighborhoods he had visited and anecdotes of people he met.\n\nOn Election Night, he did not hesitate to code-switch into Arabic, always in moments of affection. And when the speech was over, after a call-and-response with the audience, he walked offstage to “Dhoom Machale,” a Bollywood banger.\n\nEugene V. Debs (1855-1926), a labor leader and five-time Socialist Party presidential candidate, spoke these words in 1918 while awaiting sentencing after being convicted under the Espionage Act of interfering with the World War I draft. He ran for president from prison in 1920, as Convict No. 9653, and received nearly one million votes.\n\nMr. Mamdani has promoted raising the city’s minimum wage to $30 an hour by 2030, which would be a boon to workers like deliveristas, but is opposed by many business owners.\n\nThe speech was notably short on conciliatory language, echoing the rancor of the late stages of the campaign. Neither Mr. Cuomo nor Mayor Eric Adams called Mr. Mamdani to congratulate him, though Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, did.\n\nMr. Mamdani won with just over 50 percent of the vote. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio claimed a mandate after winning 73 percent of the vote in 2013, and then ran into opposition from Mr. Cuomo, then the governor, that thwarted much of his agenda. Eric Adams won 67 percent of the vote in 2021.\n\nSteinway Street in Astoria, Queens, includes a section known as Little Egypt, and is part of a stretch of Queens and Brooklyn neighborhoods that has been dubbed the “Commie Corridor.”\n\nIn Arabic, ana minkum wa alaikum translates roughly as “I’m one of you and I’m for you” (or “We are of you and you are of us”).\n\nNew York City has an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 Yemeni-owned bodegas, or small grocery stores, according to the Yemeni American Merchant Association.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the city’s taxi drivers were born outside the United States.\n\nAmong South Asians, “auntie” is a term of respect for any older woman. Mr. Mamdani was criticized for referring to a relative of his father’s, who he said was afraid to ride the subway after the Sept. 11 attacks, as his “aunt.”\n\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Mamdani made repeated visits to Kensington and Midwood in Brooklyn and Hunts Point in the Bronx, neighborhoods that do not typically get much attention from candidates. He took only 19 percent of the vote in Midwood but handily won the other two.\n\nAccording to the real estate website Zillow, the average rent for a studio apartment in New York City is $3,225.\n\nThe Bx33 bus runs between Harlem in Manhattan and Port Morris in the Bronx. Mr. Mamdani has vowed to make city buses fast and free. But the governor controls the transit authority.\n\nIn 2021, when he was still an assembly member representing Astoria, Mr. Mamdani joined a hunger strike by taxi drivers to lower the price of medallions, which they need to drive. After 15 days, the city agreed to drastic cuts in drivers’ monthly payments.\n\nMr. Gerson, the speechwriter, said Mr. Mamdani had added this sentiment so supporters could pause to reflect on how far they had come since the start of the year, when Mr. Mamdani was polling at 1 percent.\n\nHis parents are the filmmaker Mira Nair and Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University.\n\nOne New York Post article described Rama Duwaji as Mr. Mamdani’s “aloof wife” and claimed she was quietly running the campaign. Thereafter, “aloof wife” became an ironic badge of honor on social media. Hayati is Arabic for “my life.”\n\nBarack Obama’s 2008 presidential victory speech, which focused on hope and unity, was an early model for Mr. Mamdani’s address.\n\nNehru (1889-1964), India’s first prime minister, made this declaration in August 1947, on the eve of the country’s independence.\n\nA number of Mr. Mamdani’s plans are expensive and beyond the sole authority of the mayor, requiring support from the governor and Albany legislators. In his concession speech, Mr. Cuomo said those who voted against Mr. Mamdani “did not vote to support a government agenda that makes promises that we know cannot be met.”\n\nLa Guardia (1882-1947), a New Deal-supporting Republican who served three terms as mayor, sometimes referred to himself as a socialist. He is considered by many — including Mr. Mamdani — to have been the city’s best mayor.\n\nThe New York City Housing Authority, the city’s biggest landlord, manages over 177,000 apartments that are home to more than half a million legal tenants. The buildings need repairs and renovations totaling some $78 billion, according to the latest estimate by the authority.\n\nMr. Mamdani proposed this new city agency to help address crime through treatment for mental health and drug abuse, moving some responsibility away from police officers and to health care professionals.\n\nPresident Trump’s notable firings include Carla Hayden, the librarian of Congress; Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor; and Gwynne Wilcox of the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nDuring the campaign and after, Mr. Mamdani has drawn criticism from some Jewish New Yorkers for his support for Palestinian rights and tepid condemnation of the slogan “globalize the intifada.” He has reached out to Jewish leaders to assuage their doubts.\n\nMore than 20 billionaires contributed to super PACs opposing Mr. Mamdani, including Michael Bloomberg ($13.3 million), the Lauder family ($2.6 million), Joe Gebbia of Airbnb ($2 million), Bill Ackman ($1.75 million) and Barry Diller ($500,000). Mr. Mamdani has proposed a 2 percent tax increase on incomes of more than $1 million.\n\nMr. Trump has incorrectly called Mr. Mamdani a communist and threatened to deport him or deny federal funds to New York City if he was elected. But after Election Day, the president said he might “help him a little bit maybe,” because he wanted New York City to succeed. Mr. Mamdani used Mr. Trump’s antagonism — and his support for Mr. Cuomo — as a talking point.\n\nMany speculated that “turn the volume up” referred to a song by the rapper KRS-One. But Mr. Gerson, the speechwriter, said it did not.\n\nAs of the 2020 Census, 40 percent of New Yorkers were foreign-born. The city has had at least two dozen immigrant mayors, most recently London-born Abraham Beame, who ran the city from 1974 to 1977 and oversaw the city’s fiscal collapse.\n\nMr. Mamdani gives an unacknowledged shout-out here to former Gov. Mario Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo's father, who, addressing the 1984 Democratic National Convention, spoke of poetry and prose in politics, and dissected Ronald Reagan's allusion to a \"shining city on a hill.\"\n\nThe median rent in a stabilized apartment is $1,570. Mr. Mamdani pays $2,300 for a stabilized one-bedroom apartment.\n\nBy some estimates, child care in New York City costs $15,000 to $20,000 per year. Many people are quite happy on Long Island.\n\nNumerous members of the Adams administration, including the mayor himself, faced indictments or investigations. After Mr. Trump’s Justice Department abandoned the charges against Mr. Adams, apparently in exchange for his help with the president’s deportation agenda, the backlash quashed Mr. Adams’s diminishing hopes for re-election.\n\nMr. de Blasio, whom Mr. Mamdani has called the city’s best mayor in his lifetime, made universal pre-K his signature legislation.\n\nThank you, my friends. The sun may have set over our city this evening, but as Eugene Debs once said, “I can see the dawn of a better day for humanity.”\n\nFor as long as we can remember, the working people of New York have been told by the wealthy and the well-connected that power does not belong in their hands.\n\nFingers bruised from lifting boxes on the warehouse floor, palms calloused from delivery bike handlebars, knuckles scarred with kitchen burns: These are not hands that have been allowed to hold power. And yet, over the last 12 months, you have dared to reach for something greater.\n\nTonight, against all odds, we have grasped it. The future is in our hands. My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty.\n\nBut let tonight be the final time I utter his name, as we turn the page on a politics that abandons the many and answers only to the few. New York, tonight you have delivered. A mandate for change. ​​A mandate for a new kind of politics. A mandate for a city we can afford. And a mandate for a government that delivers exactly that.\n\nOn January 1st, I will be sworn in as the mayor of New York City. And that is because of you. So before I say anything else, I must say this: Thank you. Thank you to the next generation of New Yorkers who refuse to accept that the promise of a better future was a relic of the past.\n\nYou showed that when politics speaks to you without condescension, we can usher in a new era of leadership. We will fight for you, because we are you.\n\nThank you to those so often forgotten by the politics of our city, who made this movement their own. I speak of Yemeni bodega owners and Mexican abuelas. Senegalese taxi drivers and Uzbek nurses. Trinidadian line cooks and Ethiopian aunties. Yes, aunties.\n\nTo every New Yorker in Kensington and Midwood and Hunts Point, know this: This city is your city, and this democracy is yours too. This campaign is about people like Wesley, an 1199 organizer I met outside of Elmhurst Hospital on Thursday night. A New Yorker who lives elsewhere, who commutes two hours each way from Pennsylvania because rent is too expensive in this city.\n\nIt’s about people like the woman I met on the Bx33 years ago who said to me, “I used to love New York, but now it’s just where I live.” And it’s about people like Richard, the taxi driver I went on a 15-day hunger strike with outside of City Hall, who still has to drive his cab seven days a week. My brother, we are in City Hall now.\n\nThis victory is for all of them. And it’s for all of you, the more than 100,000 volunteers who built this campaign into an unstoppable force. Because of you, we will make this city one that working people can love and live in again. With every door knocked, every petition signature earned, and every hard-earned conversation, you eroded the cynicism that has come to define our politics.\n\nNow, I know that I have asked for much from you over this last year. Time and again, you have answered my calls — but I have one final request. New York City, breathe this moment in. We have held our breath for longer than we know.\n\nWe have held it in anticipation of defeat, held it because the air has been knocked out of our lungs too many times to count, held it because we cannot afford to exhale. Thanks to all of those who sacrificed so much. We are breathing in the air of a city that has been reborn.\n\nTo my campaign team, who believed when no one else did and who took an electoral project and turned it into so much more: I will never be able to express the depth of my gratitude. You can sleep now.\n\nTo my parents, Mama and Baba: You have made me into the man I am today. I am so proud to be your son. And to my incredible wife, Rama, hayati: There is no one I would rather have by my side in this moment, and in every moment.\n\nTo every New Yorker — whether you voted for me, for one of my opponents, or felt too disappointed by politics to vote at all — thank you for the opportunity to prove myself worthy of your trust. I will wake each morning with a singular purpose: to make this city better for you than it was the day before.\n\nThere are many who thought this day would never come, who feared that we would be condemned only to a future of less, with every election consigning us simply to more of the same.\n\nAnd there are others who see politics today as too cruel for the flame of hope to still burn. New York, we have answered those fears.\n\nTonight we have spoken in a clear voice. Hope is alive. Hope is a decision that tens of thousands of New Yorkers made day after day, volunteer shift after volunteer shift, despite attack ad after attack ad. More than a million of us stood in our churches, in gymnasiums, in community centers, as we filled in the ledger of democracy.\n\nAnd while we cast our ballots alone, we chose hope together. Hope over tyranny. Hope over big money and small ideas. Hope over despair. We won because New Yorkers allowed themselves to hope that the impossible could be made possible. And we won because we insisted that no longer would politics be something that is done to us. Now, it is something that we do.\n\nStanding before you, I think of the words of Jawaharlal Nehru: “A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.”\n\nTonight we have stepped out from the old into the new. So let us speak now, with clarity and conviction that cannot be misunderstood, about what this new age will deliver, and for whom.\n\nThis will be an age where New Yorkers expect from their leaders a bold vision of what we will achieve, rather than a list of excuses for what we are too timid to attempt. Central to that vision will be the most ambitious agenda to tackle the cost-of-living crisis that this city has seen since the days of Fiorello La Guardia: an agenda that will freeze the rents for more than two million rent-stabilized tenants, make buses fast and free, and deliver universal child care across our city.\n\nYears from now, may our only regret be that this day took so long to come. This new age will be one of relentless improvement. We will hire thousands more teachers. We will cut waste from a bloated bureaucracy. We will work tirelessly to make lights shine again in the hallways of NYCHA developments where they have long flickered.\n\nSafety and justice will go hand in hand as we work with police officers to reduce crime and create a Department of Community Safety that tackles the mental health crisis and homelessness crises head on. Excellence will become the expectation across government, not the exception. In this new age we make for ourselves, we will refuse to allow those who traffic in division and hate to pit us against one another.\n\nIn this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light. Here, we believe in standing up for those we love, whether you are an immigrant, a member of the trans community, one of the many Black women that Donald Trump has fired from a federal job, a single mom still waiting for the cost of groceries to go down, or anyone else with their back against the wall. Your struggle is ours, too.\n\nAnd we will build a City Hall that stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does not waver in the fight against the scourge of antisemitism. Where the more than one million Muslims know that they belong — not just in the five boroughs of this city, but in the halls of power.\n\nNo more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election. This new age will be defined by a competence and a compassion that have too long been placed at odds with one another. We will prove that there is no problem too large for government to solve, and no concern too small for it to care about.\n\nFor years, those in City Hall have only helped those who can help them. But on January 1st, we will usher in a city government that helps everyone.\n\nNow, I know that many have heard our message only through the prism of misinformation. Tens of millions of dollars have been spent to redefine reality and to convince our neighbors that this new age is something that should frighten them. As has so often occurred, the billionaire class has sought to convince those making $30 an hour that their enemies are those earning $20 an hour.\n\nThey want the people to fight amongst ourselves so that we remain distracted from the work of remaking a long-broken system. We refuse to let them dictate the rules of the game anymore. They can play by the same rules as the rest of us.\n\nTogether, we will usher in a generation of change. And if we embrace this brave new course, rather than fleeing from it, we can respond to oligarchy and authoritarianism with the strength it fears, not the appeasement it craves.\n\nAfter all, if anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. And if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.\n\nThis is not only how we stop Trump; it’s how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.\n\nWe will hold bad landlords to account because the Donald Trumps of our city have grown far too comfortable taking advantage of their tenants. We will put an end to the culture of corruption that has allowed billionaires like Trump to evade taxation and exploit tax breaks. We will stand alongside unions and expand labor protections because we know, just as Donald Trump does, that when working people have ironclad rights, the bosses who seek to extort them become very small indeed.\n\nNew York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant.\n\nSo hear me, President Trump, when I say this: To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us. When we enter City Hall in 58 days, expectations will be high. We will meet them. A great New Yorker once said that while you campaign in poetry, you govern in prose.\n\nIf that must be true, let the prose we write still rhyme, and let us build a shining city for all. And we must chart a new path, as bold as the one we have already traveled. After all, the conventional wisdom would tell you that I am far from the perfect candidate.\n\nI am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.\n\nAnd yet, if tonight teaches us anything, it is that convention has held us back. We have bowed at the altar of caution, and we have paid a mighty price. Too many working people cannot recognize themselves in our party, and too many among us have turned to the right for answers to why they’ve been left behind.\n\nWe will leave mediocrity in our past. No longer will we have to open a history book for proof that Democrats can dare to be great.\n\nOur greatness will be anything but abstract. It will be felt by every rent-stabilized tenant who wakes up on the first of every month knowing the amount they’re going to pay hasn’t soared since the month before. It will be felt by each grandparent who can afford to stay in the home they have worked for, and whose grandchildren live nearby because the cost of child care didn’t send them to Long Island.\n\nIt will be felt by the single mother who is safe on her commute and whose bus runs fast enough that she doesn’t have to rush school drop-off to make it to work on time. And it will be felt when New Yorkers open their newspapers in the morning and read headlines of success, not scandal.\n\nMost of all, it will be felt by each New Yorker when the city they love finally loves them back.\n\nTogether, New York, we’re going to freeze the… [rent!] Together, New York, we’re going to make buses fast and… [free!] Together, New York, we’re going to deliver universal… [child care!]\n\nLet the words we’ve spoken together, the dreams we’ve dreamt together, become the agenda we deliver together. New York, this power, it’s yours. This city belongs to you.\n\nProduced by Eve Edelheit, Gabriel Gianordoli and Eden Weingart.

Born to Unwed Mothers, These Children Are Trapped in Saudi Arabia\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T09:45:55-05:00\n\nIf you do not look closely, it is easy to miss the children.\n\nThey come and go during the day, a handful of boys and girls seeking refuge from the 110-degree heat. But at night, they are always there, their bodies curled up on the median near a gas station in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe girl in the red dress is Dalia, a bubbly 8-year-old who learned English from YouTube videos. The baby whimpering for milk is Abudy, born 17 days earlier. Nearby is a wide-eyed toddler, still learning to look both ways before crossing the road.\n\nTheir mothers, lying beside them, are Kenyan housekeepers and nannies. Their government encouraged workers like them to find jobs in Saudi Arabia and send their savings back to Kenya. They cleaned the houses and cared for the children of Saudi families.\n\nLike so many other Kenyans employed in Saudi homes, they faced abuse, exploitation and neglect. But other women, when they are desperate, can go home.\n\nThese women cannot. They had children outside of marriage. And now they are trapped.\n\nIn this conservative Islamic kingdom, where an unmarried mother can be jailed for an “illegal pregnancy,” it is as if their children do not exist. Without identification documents, they are banished to the fringes of society. Yet they cannot leave the country, either.\n\nPolice officers, shelter workers and diplomats turned the mothers away. Finally, they came to the gas station. It made no sense, but rumor had it that this was the one place where single mothers could be deported with their children.\n\n“I tried to leave,” says Fanice, 32, Dalia’s mother. “But it’s been impossible.”\n\nDespite a decade of social transformation in Saudi Arabia, unwed pregnancy remains a taboo that exists in a legal gray area. The children of unmarried immigrants face unique perils. They are routinely deprived of birth certificates, medical care and education, in violation of Saudi and international law, a New York Times investigation found.\n\nKenyan women and children suffer in particular, The Times found, because officials at the Kenyan Embassy berate them, stonewall them or saddle them with years of paperwork to return home. Hundreds of children, and potentially many more, have been left in the lurch — recognized by neither Saudi Arabia nor Kenya.\n\nThese children are the victims of an exploitative industry that recruits African women to Saudi Arabia — a pipeline from which Kenyan government officials personally profit through financial interests in staffing agencies. Hundreds of Kenyan women have been killed, and reports of rapes and beatings are common.\n\nFor those women who become pregnant, whether from an assault or a relationship, birthing a baby into legal limbo is a final cruelty.\n\nWith no path forward, some contemplate giving up their children. At least as wards of the state, they would receive identity documents and an education.\n\nA WhatsApp group for single mothers is filled with anguished pleas:\n\n“Hi guys. If anyone knows the mother of this child, please tell me,” read one message, accompanied by a photograph of a toddler in pink shorts. “She has been abandoned by the road.”\n\nAnother woman posted recently, “Anyone here need a new born baby?”\n\nOther mothers stay in Saudi Arabia indefinitely, raising their children in a country where they struggle to access schooling and routine vaccinations.\n\n“This life is no good,” says Dalia, who passes her days playing with dolls that her mother collects from the trash.\n\nAll of this flies in the face of a Saudi law that codifies the rights of children — unequivocally, regardless of their immigration status or lineage — to identification documents, medical care and education.\n\n“The law deems a child born to a non-Saudi mother in an irregular or undocumented manner to be affiliated with the mother and to bear her nationality, and a birth certificate is issued for such child accordingly,” the Saudi government’s Center for International Communication said in a statement to The Times.\n\nBut the government offers no public pathway for unmarried mothers to register their births. The kingdom has no birthright citizenship, and a top official at a major maternity hospital in Riyadh said that he was unsure how a single mother could get a birth certificate, but that the process would involve the police.\n\nKenya’s Ministry of Foreign and Diaspora Affairs did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nThis account is based on interviews with 25 East African women who became pregnant or gave birth in Saudi Arabia, as well as diplomats, educators, human rights activists and Saudi and Kenyan officials. Mothers still in Saudi Arabia are being identified only by first names to protect them from retaliation in the country.\n\nWhen these women have nowhere else to go, their final harbor is the gas station. Their numbers vary, but usually three or four children are here, darting around or clinging to their mothers.\n\nThe newest arrival is Esther, 39, the mother of the newborn Abudy. He was conceived during Esther’s relationship with an Egyptian driver, and she was briefly jailed after giving birth.\n\nCaressing her son’s tiny hands, Esther says she cannot understand why he has to face the consequences of her actions.\n\n“This baby is innocent,” she says. “He knows nothing.”\n\nInside a beige apartment building, the laughs and cries of a dozen children can be heard past the curtain hung over their playroom door.\n\nA 4-year-old boy bounces off the walls. A plump baby sits on a caretaker’s lap. And a 3-year-old girl sits to fasten her gold Mary Janes, wrestling them onto the wrong feet. Her name is Precious.\n\nThis unlicensed day care in Riyadh is one of many that have sprung up to meet the needs of Kenyan single mothers. Children play and sleep here for weeks on end while their mothers work as live-in cleaners, cooks and nannies, returning to see them on their days off.\n\nLicensed schools and nurseries require a birth certificate or another form of identification to enroll a child. Most of these children have none.\n\nPrecious’s mother, Penina Wanjiru Kihiu, came to Saudi Arabia in 2019. That year, with Kenya’s unemployment rising, its parliamentary labor committee urged the government to “embark on a rigorous campaign to market Saudi Arabia as an important destination country for foreign employment.”\n\nMs. Kihiu, now 32, worked for an abusive employer for nine months, she said. When he finally let her quit, she said, he abandoned her, nearly broke, at the airport. Another Kenyan offered shelter and helped her find work as a freelance housekeeper.\n\nMost mothers interviewed by The Times were working freelance when they became pregnant. Leaving their employers violates Saudi labor and immigration regulations, which human rights groups say are a form of “modern day slavery” — but it is also common.\n\nEmployers and Saudi officials call the vast work force of women like Ms. Kihiu “runaways.” Kenyan freelancers call themselves by another name: kemboi. The term is inspired by the Kenyan Olympian Ezekiel Kemboi, whose sport is steeplechase racing, in which athletes leap over hurdles.\n\nAs a new kemboi, Ms. Kihiu relied on a Nepali taxi driver to ferry her around Riyadh. They began dating, and soon, she said, she missed her period.\n\nMost mothers interviewed by The Times conceived their children during a relationship with another immigrant. Four said that they had been raped. Two said they had not realized they were pregnant when they arrived in Saudi Arabia. Apparently, their mandatory medical exams hadn’t detected their early pregnancies.\n\nMs. Kihiu’s friends urged her to get an abortion. So did the father, who later told her he had left the country, she said.\n\nSaudi Arabia permits abortions only in limited circumstances. Ms. Kihiu feared that an underground abortion would kill her. She also wanted the baby. She was elated when she found out she was having a girl.\n\nPregnant women are entitled to medical care, regardless of their paperwork, the Saudi government center said. But when an unmarried woman gives birth, the hospital must notify the police of an “illegal pregnancy,” said Dr. Mufareh Asiri, the medical director of the women’s health hospital at King Saud Medical City.\n\nSo, like many single mothers, Ms. Kihiu gave birth at home. After eight hours of labor, Precious arrived on May 17, 2022.\n\nPrecious’s day care was run by a matronly proprietor named Agatha, who decorated the walls with handmade posters, including an illustration of the Kenyan flag. Ms. Kihiu would spend days or weeks working and then visit her daughter when she returned. While she was gone, Agatha became Precious’s surrogate mother.\n\nDespite such hardships, many mothers choose to stay in Saudi Arabia, fearing worse prospects back home. Depending on their resources and luck, some build decent lives. They pay inflated fees for private medical care and send their children to informal schools.\n\nThe same WhatsApp group that has grim messages about abandoned children is also peppered with joyful ones, including invitations to a baby shower — “Dress code — all white.”\n\nMs. Kihiu hoped to be so lucky.\n\nThough she was a kemboi and her daughter was born outside of marriage, she felt no need to hide. She and Precious often saw police officers at a park. They never bothered her. An officer once gave them money to buy milk, she said.\n\nOne day in March, she finished a job and bought diapers for Precious, planning to visit her the next day.\n\nThat evening, the police raided Ms. Kihiu’s housing complex.\n\nShe was arrested along with other East African residents, she said, in what she assumes was an immigration crackdown.\n\n“Fate just catches up with you,” she said.\n\nPrecious was still at the day care.\n\nMs. Kihiu said she begged the officers to deport her daughter along with her.\n\n“I banged on the prison doors,” she said.\n\nThe authorities agreed to let Agatha bring Precious to the detention center, Ms. Kihiu recalled. But Agatha, fearing arrest — she, too, is a kemboi — said she could not.\n\nOn March 28, Ms. Kihiu was deported to Kenya, alone.\n\nThe Saudi government did not respond to questions about her case, but said that separating a mother and child was not allowed “under any circumstance.”\n\nEven if Agatha had brought Precious, the little girl would not have been able to leave the country without documents. Several women said that the authorities had denied their pleas to self-deport with their children.\n\nIn the end, the mothers can leave. Their children cannot.\n\nFor Precious, the day care is home now. On a video call with her mother in August, she no longer spoke. “She just looks at you,” Ms. Kihiu said.\n\nReligious police officers used to stalk the streets of Saudi Arabia searching for unmarried couples. Gender segregation was so strict that men courted women by tossing slips of paper with their phone numbers at them.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, has loosened social restrictions dramatically over the past decade. Today, people flirt openly in low-lit restaurants and dry nightclubs.\n\nBut because the kingdom has no written penal code, the boundaries of permissible behavior are fuzzy. Two unmarried mothers interviewed by The Times said that they had been briefly jailed. Others, including several who gave birth in hospitals, said they had faced no repercussions.\n\nThe snag came when they tried to register their children.\n\nOn paper, all children in Saudi Arabia are entitled to birth certificates, and parents are obligated to report home births to the authorities, the Saudi government center said.\n\nIn reality, single mothers fall into a bureaucratic abyss. When foreign parents apply for birth certificates, the authorities are supposed to “verify that the marital relationship exists.” An absent or uncooperative father can hinder a child’s registration.\n\nAsked how unmarried women could obtain birth certificates at his hospital, Dr. Asiri said it was a “complicated process” involving social workers and the police.\n\n“By the end, she can get it,” he said. “But I’m not sure how.”\n\nFacing a dead end, many mothers turn to their embassies for help.\n\nCountries like the Philippines operate shelters for destitute mothers in Saudi Arabia, guide them through the process of obtaining birth certificates and exit permits for their children, and buy them plane tickets.\n\nSeveral mothers said that workers at the Kenyan Embassy called them prostitutes or accused them of seducing men. Purity Marangu, 37, said that when she arrived, pregnant, at the embassy in 2021 and told staff members there she had been raped, they scolded her for not reporting the incident to them sooner.\n\nAfter repeated embassy visits yielded no help getting home, she surrendered to the police and asked to be deported.\n\nThe police, she said, told her to go to the embassy.\n\nSome mothers received Kenyan birth certificates at the embassy, but could not say why they succeeded. Others could not get them, and similarly had no idea why.\n\n“Our government, I think they don’t care,” said Rose Namusasi, a Kenyan woman who works at a school in Riyadh and has assumed an unofficial role lobbying Kenyan officials on behalf of the mothers.\n\nIn recent years, the embassy has required DNA maternity tests before women can go home with their children. But the embassy offered them only once, in 2023, mothers and activists said.\n\nIn the United States, court-ordered tests typically take a few weeks. While some women received their results, Ms. Marangu and other mothers have been waiting for years. “It’s like they threw it all away,” she said.\n\nKenya’s foreign minister, Musalia Mudavadi, told Parliament in April that he knew of 388 children born to Kenyan mothers in Saudi Arabia. He said the embassy had collected hundreds of DNA samples, as a way to protect the children.\n\nSome mothers told The Times they had tried to send their children home with friends or strangers so they could stay and keep working.\n\n“There is a worry that some people may be involved in child trafficking,” he said.\n\nHe did not explain why many DNA test results never arrived. Diplomats from several other embassies said that they confirm maternity through other methods, including interviews and observation.\n\nAfter The Times submitted questions to the Kenyan government, several mothers said there was suddenly renewed activity around their cases, with the government promising new DNA tests soon.\n\nNone of the mothers seemed to know who had arrived there first, or when.\n\nTheir paths there had differed. Beatrice Nasimiyu could not make ends meet on her meager salary while caring for twins.\n\nFanice and her daughter, Dalia, took DNA tests but never got the results.\n\nFor Dorcas, the last straw was when another Kenyan woman she was staying with tried to coerce her into sex work, then kicked her out when she refused.\n\nIn distress, all had been guided by someone who told the same story: If you have a child, and want to be deported, go to the gas station in the southern Riyadh neighborhood of Manfooha.\n\nEsther arrived in September, weak and confused after giving birth to Abudy.\n\nShe had been legally employed as a maid-for-hire by Maharah Human Resources, a Saudi corporation with a market capitalization of more than $650 million and major American shareholders, through index funds, that include BlackRock and Morgan Stanley. (Both declined to comment.)\n\nWorking in a small town north of Riyadh, Esther formed a relationship with an Egyptian driver. She became pregnant and gave birth in Maharah staff housing. When a supervisor found them, she took them to a hospital, Esther said.\n\nThere, the police detained her and transferred her to Riyadh, she said, where officers questioned her about her pregnancy. They released her and told her to call a friend, she said.\n\nEsther knew no one in Riyadh. She spent days sleeping outside with Abudy, struggling to produce breast milk because of hunger, while pleading for help from every authority she could find.\n\nShe visited one of her employer’s offices but was turned away and sent to the Kenyan Embassy, she said, where the staff said DNA tests could not be offered for at least a month.\n\nSo Esther turned up at a shelter for female migrant workers awaiting deportation. But the staff said she could not enter with a baby. The shelter regularly denies entrance to women with children, several mothers said.\n\nSaudi Logistic Services Company, which runs the shelter, did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did her employer, Maharah.\n\n“You are the people who are supposed to help me,” Esther remembers thinking. “What do you expect me to do?”\n\nA taxi driver told her about the gas station.\n\nThe other mothers had set up a small encampment on a tree-lined median. When Esther arrived, Fanice befriended her and Dorcas gave her diapers.\n\nThe cashier at the station’s minimart charges their phones for free. Passers-by sometimes bring food, water and clothing. That is how Dalia got her red dress.\n\nThe story about getting deported from the gas station turned out to be a myth. Fanice flagged down police cars, pleading to be arrested, she said.\n\n“‘Did you come here to work or to give birth?’” Ms. Nasimiyu remembers one officer asking her. “‘Stay there and let the sun burn you.’”\n\nAfter The Times inquired about Esther’s case, a Maharah employee called her, asked where she was and promised to send a driver. She and Abudy could come to staff housing.\n\nAs she packed her things, Esther felt a mixture of relief and worry. She had no idea how they would get home to Kenya.\n\nBut at least they would have somewhere to sleep that night.\n\nWhen she finished packing, she waited on a stained mattress. Trucks rumbled past.\n\n“Go to sleep,” Esther urged her baby. She laid Abudy over her knees and smoothed his black hair. Heat rash was spreading across his back.\n\nThe driver did not come. Abudy did not sleep. Exhausted, she lay back and cradled him against her chest, jiggling him gently.\n\nFinally, her ride arrived. The driver was confused. He had gone to the location he was sent, but he figured he was in the wrong place.\n\nWhy would a woman and a baby be at a gas station?\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/nyregion/mamdani-fuleihan-deputy-mayor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:32:21-05:00","title":"Mamdani Fills 2 Top Posts With Government Veteran and Trusted Aide","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has made his first major appointments to the city’s administration, naming veteran budget expert Dean Fuleihan as top deputy mayor and longtime aide Elle Bisgaard-Church as chief of staff.

his administration on Monday, tapping Dean Fuleihan, a well-known veteran of city and state government, to be his top deputy in City Hall.\n\nAs expected, Mr. Mamdani also announced that Elle Bisgaard-Church, his chief of staff in the State Assembly and longtime right-hand, will hold the same title in City Hall.\n\nThe selection of Mr. Fuleihan in particular was notably conventional after a campaign run on generational and ideological change. But Mr. Mamdani, 34, has long emphasized that he would need the help of government experts to implement his ambitious agenda and contend with President Trump.\n\nMr. Fuleihan, 74, has more experience than most. A longtime budget expert for the State Assembly, he served as former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s budget director before becoming his first deputy mayor, the job he will now return to.\n\nHe will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of city government. Aides to Mr. Mamdani noted that Mr. Fuleihan helped Mr. de Blasio navigate a contentious relationship with Mr. Trump during the president’s first term.\n\nMs. Bisgaard-Church, 34, is a democratic socialist like Mr. Mamdani, and led the small and unusually young group of campaign staff members who oversaw his remarkable rise from a backbench member of the Assembly to the youngest mayor in more than a century.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Mamdani said the appointments would help him build “a powerful and competent administration that delivers an affordable, livable city for working people.”\n\nMr. Mamdani will face a steep set of challenges when he takes office on Jan. 1. He campaigned on an expansive and expensive set of solutions to the city’s spiraling living costs: making buses free, expanding government-funded child care and freezing rent for nearly a million rent-stabilized apartments.\n\nTo do most of it, Mr. Mamdani will have to persuade state lawmakers and Gov. Kathy Hochul to not only approve his plans but raise billions of dollars in new revenue to pay for them, either through new taxes or other measures. Ms. Hochul has said she wants to work with Mr. Mamdani on the child care initiative, especially, but she raised doubts over the weekend about ending bus fares.\n\nThen there is Mr. Trump, a former New Yorker, who has dismissed Mr. Mamdani as a radical “communist.” The president has already threatened to withhold billions of dollars in crucial federal funds from the city or send in National Guard troops if Mr. Mamdani pursues policies he does not like.\n\nThe timing of Monday’s announcement, just after the mayor-elect returned from an annual post-election political gathering in Puerto Rico, suggested he was moving more quickly than his predecessors to roll out appointments.\n\nBoth Mayor Eric Adams, the outgoing mayor, and Mr. de Blasio waited until December to unveil their selections for first deputy mayor and other high-level positions.\n\nLast week, Mr. Mamdani appointed five women to run his transition committee. He is expected to make additional appointments in the coming weeks and has been meeting with candidates for schools chancellor, among other positions.\n\nMr. Fuleihan has spent months quietly advising Mr. Mamdani, Ms. Bisgaard-Church and others on the campaign as they prepared for the possibility of governing.\n\nHe spent much of his career as a top aide to Sheldon Silver, the former Assembly speaker. He joined Mr. de Blasio’s administration in 2013 to lead the mayor’s Office of Management and Budget, where he helped negotiate labor contracts. He was later elevated to first deputy mayor, a position that also meant he served as acting mayor when Mr. de Blasio left the state.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/world/europe/trump-bbc-lawsuit-documentary.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:18:22-05:00","title":"Trump Threatens to Sue the BBC for $1 Billion After Jan. 6 Documentary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over alleged 'malicious, disparaging' edits to a January 6, 2021 speech featured in the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?'

Know About the Turmoil at the BBC\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T11:30:54-05:00\n\nThe BBC, one of the world’s biggest broadcasters, has been plunged into crisis after two top executives quit after a leaked memo suggesting that it had misleadingly edited a speech by President Trump that preceded the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nThe departures leave a vacuum of leadership at the organization, while the White House has been publicly celebrating.\n\nHere’s what to know.\n\nA highly critical letter, written by a former external adviser to the BBC board, Michael Prescott, said that a documentary called “Trump: A Second Chance?,” broadcast before the presidential election last year, at one point spliced together footage from comments that Mr. Trump made about 50 minutes apart. In his speech on Jan. 6 to supporters in Washington as Congress was certifying the results that showed Joseph R. Biden Jr. had won the election, Mr. Trump said, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.”\n\nBut the documentary, produced as part of the BBC’s long-running Panorama series, cut that together with a previous sentence in which the president said, “I’ll be there with you,” and with a much later quote from his speech. The edited version suggested that he had said: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol … and I’ll be there with you … and we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nThe documentary is no longer available to watch on the BBC’s online player. Samir Shah, the BBC’s chairman, said in a letter Monday that complaints about the editing of the clips had been discussed by the standards committee in January and May, and that the points raised in the review had been relayed to the Panorama team.\n\n“With hindsight, it would have been better to take more formal action,” he wrote. He added: “We accept that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action. The BBC would like to apologize for that error of judgment.”\n\nBBC News reported on Monday that President Trump had sent a letter to the BBC threatening legal action. It cited the BBC’s saying it had received the letter “and will respond in due course.”\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Trump’s outside legal team said Monday that a letter had been sent to the BBC, claiming that the broadcaster had defamed President Trump and that the intention was to interfere in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, said Mr. Trump would file a $1 billion lawsuit if the BBC did not formally retract the report, apologize and “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.”\n\nThe memo’s writer, Mr. Prescott, is a former political editor of The Sunday Times of London, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.\n\nIn 2001, Mr. Prescott moved into corporate communications and public relations, where he has spent the past two and a half decades.\n\nIn 2022, he was appointed as an independent external adviser to the BBC’s editorial standards committee. He left that role in June and wrote the memo, which is addressed to board members, after his departure. As well as the documentary about Mr. Trump, Mr. Prescott’s letter criticizes the BBC’s handling of stories about transgender rights; Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza; and its BBC Arabic division, which gave a platform to a journalist who had posted antisemitic comments.\n\nMr. Shah rejected many of Mr. Prescott’s claims in his letter to a House of Commons select committee on Monday. He said the memo was a “personal account” that “does not present a full picture of the discussions, decisions and actions that were taken.” All of the issues raised by Mr. Prescott had been scrutinized in the past by the board and the standards committee, he wrote, and in many cases the BBC had already acted to tackle the problems, including by changing editorial guidance, appointing new people to leadership positions and carrying out formal disciplinary measures.\n\n“It is not true to say that concerns have been ignored or action not taken,” Mr. Shah wrote.\n\nAs the BBC’s director general, Mr. Davie has for five years held one of the toughest positions in British public life, ultimately responsible not just for the BBC’s news coverage with a global reach, but also for its vast other output, including drama series and sports, and for the conduct of star performers.\n\nThe BBC, or British Broadcasting Corporation, has a unique status in Britain. It is funded primarily from an annual license fee paid by households that watch TV, supplemented by commercial revenue, and it has a mandate to “act in the public interest,” providing “impartial, high-quality” content that informs, educates and entertains.\n\nThat ambitious goal puts its boss firmly in the spotlight. While the corporation is not funded by the government, Parliament does oversee the level of the license fee paid by TV viewers in Britain, and as a result, the BBC has for many years come under political pressure from all sides.\n\nThe surprise resignations of Mr. Davie and Deborah Turness, the chief executive of the BBC, appear to have been catalyzed by the leak to The Daily Telegraph of Mr. Prescott’s memo and by the days of public pressure that followed.\n\nIn Mr. Davie’s resignation statement on Sunday, he said: “While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility.”\n\nMs. Turness said, “The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC — an institution that I love.” But she added, “While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n\nMr. Davie’s successor will be appointed by the BBC board, which is led by its chairman, Mr. Shah, and consists of 10 nonexecutive members (including Mr. Shah) and four executive members.\n\nMr. Davie, announcing his departure, said that he was “working through exact timings with the board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.” The aim, he added, was to allow his successor “the best conditions and space” to help shape a new royal charter, the document that lays out the governance and regulatory rules for the BBC, and another agreement on the corporation’s funding. The current arrangements expire at the end of 2027.\n\nMichael D. Shear contributed reporting from London.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/world/middleeast/a-syrian-village-and-the-long-road-to-the-white-house.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:42:39-05:00","title":"A Syrian Village and the Long Road to the White House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article traces the dramatic transformation of Ahmed al-Shara, a former jihadist associate of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, into Syria’s first post-Assad leader, now set to be honored at the White House by President Donald Trump.

night raid in the sleepy northwestern Syrian village of Barisha, Rashid Muhammad Kaseer still shudders at the memory of the clattering helicopters overhead.\n\nAwakening, he thought perhaps a Syrian regime chopper needed to make an emergency landing. He did not think he was about to witness the American elimination of the most wanted terrorist on earth.\n\nThe helicopters carried American Delta Force commandos on a mission to kill Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State global terrorist network, who once imposed a brutal interpretation of Islam on territory that covered half of Syria and a third of Iraq.\n\n“He died like a dog,” President Trump said on Oct. 27, 2019, describing his obsession throughout his first term with eliminating al-Baghdadi. In a triumphant mood, he dwelt on the way the orchestrator of beheadings, deaths by stoning, executions of several Americans and devastating terrorist attacks in cities across the world went “whimpering and crying and screaming” to his death.\n\n“Of course he did,” said Mr. Kaseer, wearing a hat inscribed with the words “Be brave, Be free” and sitting in his garden surrounded by olive groves. “We were in the house next door and we were scared out of our minds!”\n\nAt the time, just 25 miles south in the city of Idlib, a former associate of al-Baghdadi’s who had known him in Iraq had established himself as a local leader of resistance to Syria’s suffocating regime. Charged by al-Baghdadi with expanding Al Qaeda into Syria, he had broken with him around 2013 and, by turns conciliatory and ruthless, gradually embarked from 2016 on a more moderate course.\n\nThe man was Ahmed al-Shara, known back then by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. He went on to topple Bashar al-Assad last December, became president of Syria after a five-decade dictatorship, had a friendly first meeting with Mr. Trump in Saudi Arabia in May, and will be received by Mr. Trump at the White House on Monday as the first Syrian leader so honored.\n\n“It is an amazing turn of events when you think that Trump killed Mr. al-Shara’s erstwhile boss and mentor, al-Baghdadi,” said Randa Slim, a fellow at the Johns Hopkins University-based Foreign Policy Institute.\n\n“The al-Shara story is yet to be written,” she added. “He has brought hope, but will he become repressive?”\n\nMr. al-Shara’s journey from a jihadist intent on killing American soldiers in Iraq to today’s suave, impeccably dressed, conciliatory leader wooing nations across the globe is so immense that questions are inevitably asked about how complete the conversion really is.\n\nFor now, many Syrians, including Mr. Kaseer in Barisha, are speaking more freely and feel an immense weight has been lifted from their shoulders. Exhaustion with fighting after a 13-year civil war is such that a return to armed conflict between the country’s myriad ethnic and religious groups seems unlikely, at least in the short term, even though there have been serious outbreaks of violence.\n\n“Al-Shara is excellent,” said Mr. Kaseer, insisting that his guests should eat and starting to cut radishes, chives, tomatoes and peppers from his garden to that end. “He is trying to serve the people. We are very relieved by the change in government.”\n\nAsked what he made of the fast-blossoming alliance between the president and Mr. Trump, he said didn’t want to be detained for giving the wrong answer.\n\nDetained by who? “Mr. Trump,” he said with a laugh. “Of course.”\n\nHumor, also, is making a comeback in Syria.\n\nThe sun beat down, a call to prayer rose from a nearby mosque. Beyond the fence of Mr. Kaseer’s home, built in 2016, an open expanse of stunted trees and rocks are what remain of al-Baghdadi’s compound. A couple of yellow concrete structures built as toilets for people internally displaced during the civil war form a desolate sight.\n\nMr. Trump said in 2019 that the terrorist leader had been hunted down in a tunnel where “he ignited his vest, killing himself” and three children he had dragged along. “His body was mutilated by the blast.”\n\nThat night, Mr. Kaseer said he heard an American service member screaming in Arabic that the house under attack was surrounded and everyone should step out, undressed. He heard gunfire and explosions.\n\nThe American operation lasted 3.5 hours, he said. The next morning four dead bodies, two women and two men, lay naked in the rubble. There was nothing left of al-Baghdadi.\n\nImad Najar, another Barisha resident, said nobody in the village had any idea that al-Baghdadi lived among them. Like Mr. Kaseer, he was skeptical that any tunnels existed.\n\nThe food arrived, a copious feast of eggs, a spicy red paste made from peppers and olive oil, canned sardines, and the garden crop.\n\n“Bring the olive oil,” Mr. Kaseer, who was born in Barisha and was a city employee at the mortuary for some years, called out. “The good stuff, not the watered down one!”\n\nHe still hopes for compensation — perhaps $5,000, he suggested — from the United States for the damage done to his house and the traumatic impact of the raid.\n\nA father of five, aged 45, he said he and his wife had been unable to have more children since 2019 because the trauma affected his fertility.\n\n“I didn’t recover from the huge shock. The chopper was 10 meters above the house.”\n\nDown in Idlib, where a six-lane highway into the city from the north is being completed, an immense white flag of Mr. al-Shara’s former rebel movement, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, greets visitors. The group was designated until four months ago by the United States as a terrorist organization.\n\nOn the flag is written: “No God except Allah. No Prophet except Muhammad.”\n\nThere is no Syrian flag as yet at the northern entrance to Idlib, at least none as prominent. Mr. al-Shara’s construction of a united Syria is a work in progress, now strongly backed by the United States.\n\nThe new president is more familiar with authoritarian systems than power sharing, and it is not clear what political direction he will take, but the freedom in his country compared to 11 months ago is experienced with a sense of wonderment by the likes of Mr. Kaseer.\n\nOnce he turned away from jihadism, Mr. al-Shara is believed to have cooperated with the United States in providing intelligence that led to the hunting down of Islamic State and Al Qaeda leaders around Idlib, according to a Western ambassador in Damascus who requested anonymity in line with diplomatic practice.\n\nWhether that had anything to do with what Mr. Trump considers to be one of the crowning achievements of his first term — the killing of al-Baghdadi — will perhaps never be known.\n\nHussam Hammoud contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/nyregion/council-speaker-nyc.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:48:54-05:00","title":"Who Will Be Mamdani’s City Council Partner?

Get Ready for a Battle.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T10:48:54-05:00\n\nAt the Caribe Hilton’s signature steakhouse, where the 16-ounce New York strip goes for $69, the arrival of certain dignitaries from New York City was noted with fanfare.\n\nShaun Abreu, a Manhattan City Council member, shouted out the names of fellow Council members, current and future, an aide dutifully jotting them down.\n\nBy the end of the night on Thursday, the list numbered 27 — many, perhaps, supporting the event’s host, Councilwoman Julie Menin, and her bid to become the new Council speaker.\n\nIn another part of the beachfront resort, a similar reception was simultaneously held on behalf of the other leading candidate for speaker, Councilwoman Crystal Hudson. It was hosted by Richard R. Buery Jr., the chief executive of the Robin Hood Foundation, an anti-poverty group, and Twyla Carter, the head of the Legal Aid Society.\n\nMs. Hudson’s event also attracted 27 Council members, with some hustling over to hit both receptions. Ms. Hudson’s guest list included Adrienne Adams, the current speaker whose term is expiring because of term limits.\n\nMuch of the attention at Somos, an annual gathering in San Juan of New York’s political class, was directed toward Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City. Adulation followed him to Puerto Rico, where he pledged to deliver on his affordability agenda in front of a cheering crowd under soaring palm trees.\n\nBut for Mr. Mamdani to follow through, he will need capable partners, and that starts with the next Council speaker.\n\nThe speaker race has been contentious, and the tension grew over the weekend at the tropical political getaway. Mr. Mamdani dodged questions about whom he supports for the job, and it is not clear if he will publicly back someone.\n\nThe decision is made by the 51-member Council, which will vote to pick a speaker in January. Several people are interested in the position, but the contest appears to have narrowed to Ms. Menin, from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and Ms. Hudson, from central Brooklyn.\n\nBoth are Democrats. Ms. Menin, who did not endorse a mayoral candidate, is viewed as a moderate and was endorsed by The New York Post; Ms. Hudson is a member of the Council’s progressive caucus who endorsed Mr. Mamdani.\n\nMs. Hudson, 42, was one of the first out gay Black women elected in New York. She has a 2-year-old daughter and said that she wants to help Mr. Mamdani carry out his affordability agenda, including universal child care.\n\nBut she said that the Council was a “coequal branch of government” and would have an important oversight role to monitor the Mamdani administration.\n\n“We’re not always going to agree on everything,” Ms. Hudson said. “I think it’s really important as the speaker to stand with members in those moments of disagreement, and to do so in a respectful way that ensures we maintain a productive working relationship.”\n\nMs. Menin, 58, said she had a “productive conversation” with Mr. Mamdani shortly before the election and wants to work with him on child care and affordable housing. She has held several prominent roles in city government and pointed to her work in former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration to fight President Trump as the director of the census.\n\n“I’m ready to unite the Council and work with the mayor to create a more affordable city that can also withstand the challenges we face from Washington,” she said.\n\nMs. Menin would be the first Jewish speaker, and some Jewish leaders hope that she could serve as a counterbalance to Mr. Mamdani, who will be the city’s first Muslim mayor and whose criticism of Israel worried some Jewish voters. Ms. Menin, whose mother and grandmother survived the Holocaust, has worked on efforts to combat antisemitism.\n\nUnion leaders and two powerful congressmen, Gregory Meeks and Adriano Espaillat, mingled inside Morton’s The Steakhouse to show their support for Ms. Menin. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, an influential union, told the crowd that Ms. Menin’s experience in government could help Mr. Mamdani “get stuff done.”\n\n“People around the country are going to be rooting for our mayor-elect to fail,” she said. “You need to have people in the City Council who are going to be working side by side with him.”\n\nOther members in the running include Amanda Farías, a councilwoman from the Bronx who serves as majority leader, Selvena Brooks-Powers, a councilwoman from Queens, and Chris Marte, a councilman from Manhattan.\n\nAnother contender, Carmen De La Rosa, an ally of Mr. Mamdani, recently dropped out of the race and backed Ms. Hudson in an effort to unite progressive members. Ms. De La Rosa, who is from the Dominican Republic and represents neighborhoods in northern Manhattan with many immigrants, said Ms. Hudson understood her neighbors.\n\n“As women of color, we know what is at stake in this moment — a federal administration that is standing on the necks of the most vulnerable communities like mine,” she said.\n\nDiana Ayala, a departing council member, publicly criticized Ms. Menin at a party on Friday night in a video that circulated online. She claimed that Ms. Menin had questioned whether Ms. Ayala was smart enough to run for speaker in 2021. Ms. Menin denied her account and said, “We should be uplifting women, not tearing each other down.”\n\nMs. Ayala, who once lived in a homeless shelter, said afterward that she was part of the “Anybody But Julie” effort and that Ms. Menin did not understand the concerns of working-class New Yorkers.\n\nSeveral council members defended Ms. Menin and gave her their support. Kevin Riley, who represents working-class neighborhoods in the Bronx, said she was “extremely helpful” in his district. Linda Lee and Sandra Ung, two councilwomen from Queens, praised her efforts to pass a bill to improve working conditions for hotel workers.\n\nSeveral new Council members were elected last week. When they take office in January, there will be five Republicans on the Council and 46 Democrats.\n\nUnions and party leaders often play a major role in the decision. Ms. Menin has support from the powerful Hotel & Gaming Trades Council, which endorsed Mr. Mamdani. Ms. Hudson was spotted on Friday meeting with Henry Garrido, the leader of District Council 37.\n\nOther signs of speaker intrigue were visible. On Friday afternoon, the party leaders of the city’s four major Democratic counties — Keith L. Wright of Manhattan, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn of Brooklyn, Mr. Meeks of Queens and Jamaal Bailey of the Bronx — huddled at an out-of-the-way table discussing the dynamics of the speaker’s race. But they clammed up when a reporter approached.\n\n“This is like Mount Rushmore,” Mr. Wright said in a deep baritone. “Not going to say anything.”\n\nMr. Mamdani would probably prefer to have a speaker who is aligned with his left-leaning views. But when Mr. Adams backed a speaker candidate four years ago, it did not end well and strained his relationship with the Council.\n\nThe mayor-elect is staying out of the race for now. When reporters asked him in Puerto Rico on Saturday about his preference, he said he had met with all the speaker candidates.\n\n“I respect the Council and the deliberations that they are making,” he said.\n\nNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/world/europe/ukraine-draft-dodging-russia-war.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:38:43-05:00","title":"The Village Where Draft-Age Men Have Mostly Vanished","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Vylkove, a small Ukrainian fishing town in southern Ukraine, most men of draft age have disappeared due to draft evasion, either fleeing to neighboring countries or hiding at home.

training base, but he went absent without leave from the army after three days. Since then, he has been hiding at home in Vylkove, a small town in southernmost Ukraine, rarely stepping outside.\n\nAlmost four years after the full-scale Russian invasion, Ukraine faces the twin challenges of not having enough troops and men avoiding military service. Many men of draft age, 25 to 60, have broken the law that prohibits most of them from leaving the country, while others play a cat-and-mouse game with conscription officers or just hunker down at home.\n\nThe unique geography and history of Vylkove, a run-down Danube River fishing port, have made it an exaggerated version of Ukraine in miniature, where draft-age men have all but vanished.\n\n“Who’s left?” asked Ivan, 42, speaking on the condition that his last name be withheld for his safety. “Women, the elderly and men who try not to go out unnecessarily.”\n\nNational identity is not so deeply rooted in this region, which has changed hands repeatedly between countries, and enthusiasm for the war is unusually low here, though plenty of men have gone to fight.\n\nRomania beckons, visible just across the Danube, and Moldova is close by, so escape is unusually enticing. Many men have gone that route, but others have died trying or been caught. Vylkove is hemmed in by rivers, marshes and roadblocks, making flight difficult and dangerous enough to convince men like Ivan that they are better off just hiding, dreading a knock on the door.\n\nIn contrast, Vylkove’s women come and go freely, and for some, the changes have been liberating, opening up jobs that had been closed to them.\n\nThe draft dragnet is especially intense along Ukraine’s borders. Vylkove has canals for streets — it is sometimes called, with considerable generosity, the Venice of Ukraine — and border guard boats patrol the waterways.\n\nMen have tried to cross the river to Romania in boats, diving equipment, even homemade rafts of five-liter plastic bottles.\n\n“Even well-prepared people got caught in currents,” and are swept away, said Oleh Mukomela, a major in the border guard service. The service estimates that, nationwide, at least 70 men have drowned or died in the woods and marshes while trying to escape Ukraine.\n\nJust one road leads out of Vylkove, and it has border guard roadblocks. Farther along, the main highway providing access to the rest of the country crosses into Moldova, and then back into Ukraine, passing through border posts. There was another major road, leading to Odesa, until Russian bombardment damaged a bridge on it.\n\nMariners are permitted to leave Ukraine for work on ships, but many have set sail and not returned. Their wives and children who stayed behind now visit them in neighboring countries between sea voyages.\n\nDraft dodgers who can make their way around checkpoints often abandon their cars and dash on foot through trees and vegetable gardens to Moldova. Criminal networks smuggle people out of the country illegally, for a steep price.\n\nUkrainian commanders and military experts say the troop shortage has opened gaps of hundreds of yards between manned frontline positions, enabling Russian advances. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian troops have been killed, wounded or captured, or are missing.\n\nAmid such sacrifice, Ukrainians are generally not sympathetic to those who avoid service. Prosecutors say they have opened 290,000 cases for desertion or for being absent without leave.\n\nBut the region once known as Southern Bessarabia, which includes Vylkove, is different. Much of the population is Russian-speaking, descended from “Old Believers” who centuries ago rejected modernizing trends in the Russian Orthodox Church and settled here to escape persecution.\n\nSince 1812, this area has been held by the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Moldavia, Romania, Russia again, Ukraine, Germany, Romania again, the Soviet Union, Romania a third time, the Soviet Union again and then Ukraine again. The shifting national allegiance has left a deep imprint on how residents view the government and their duty to serve, said Volodymyr Poltorak, historian at the Oriental Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences.\n\n“Any form of authority is met with distrust,” he said. “In a way, they are anarchists.”\n\nOf the nearly 8,000 residents of Vylkove when the full-scale war began, only about 5,000 remain — though with so many people hiding, estimates are tricky. Everyone knows someone who left.\n\n“I really miss him,” said Halyna Silarina, 55, of a sailor friend who left when the war started.\n\nPouring homemade wine into their glasses, her husband, Anatoliy Silarin, 61, toasted to the return of their former lives. “Maybe this place used to be Venice,” he said. “Now who knows what it is.”\n\n“The world has shrunk completely,” said one male resident who is nearly 60 but still draft-eligible. He requested anonymity to avoid being caught. About half the remaining men of draft age do not leave their houses at all, he said.\n\nAs to feeling trapped,  he said it was important not to dwell on it. He busied himself this year by picking the figs from his tree as they ripened each day, and made fig jam, he said.\n\nWith men missing, women adopted traditionally male jobs, including fishing, a mainstay of the town’s economy. From around 700 fishermen, Vylkove is down to only 70, most of them older than 60, according to the mayor, Matviy Ivanov.\n\nAt the city hall, Mr. Ivanov said, all the other employees are women. “I’m the only man left.” Or, at least, the only one visible.\n\n“It’s women everywhere” in town now, he said. “They enjoy it, they’ve taken over every sector, and now they’re in charge.”\n\nTwo sisters, Antonina Bilovolenko, 67, and Klavdiia Moskvichova, 63, are delighted to have become employees of a fishing company, even if it is hard work.\n\nThey always loved fishing but before the war they couldn’t get jobs doing it, so they mostly tended gardens instead. But with labor in short supply, companies have become more open to hiring women. Every day now, they put on warm clothes, prepare their nets, and sail out to catch fish.\n\n“We love it, love it above all jobs,” Ms. Moskvichova said.\n\nMs. Bilovolenko added, “You go out on the water and forget everything, the what and the how.”\n\nTheir brother, Anatoliy Unharov, 66, used to work for the same company and envies his sisters still being out on the water. “Not all men can match them when it comes to fishing,” he said.\n\nFor other women, the changes are more a burden than an opportunity.\n\nOlha, 50, said she struggled with the physical labor she does for a company that harvests reeds for export. Her husband was detained by draft officers and put into the army, she said, so she took over his job. She declined to give her surname, fearing it could help expose men in hiding.\n\nThe work was hard, she said, adding that her husband used to do it.\n\nWar has hit the area’s tourism business hard. One local company, Pelican, which plays on the Venice parallel, had 50 employees before the war. Now there are 20, mainly women and older people, said the owner, Mykhailo Zhmud, who at 66 is too old to draft.\n\nHis mechanic is now hiding at home, he said. “When I call and ask him to look at the boat, he says, ‘Let me first check if there are draft officers in town.’”\n\nEvelina Riabenko contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/world/europe/ukraine-corruption-energy.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:15:37-05:00","title":"Anti-Corruption Agencies Double Down Despite Pressure From Zelensky","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies, including the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Special Anticorruption Prosecutor, announced a major investigation into a corruption scheme involving state-owned nuclear energy company Energoatom.

Anti-Corruption Agencies Double Down Despite Pressure From Zelensky\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T10:15:37-05:00\n\nThe main anti-corruption agencies in Ukraine announced on Monday that they had uncovered a major corruption scheme in which contractors of the state-owned nuclear energy company had been forced to pay hefty kickbacks.\n\nThe inquiry was announced by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Special Anticorruption Prosecutor — agencies that President Volodymyr Zelensky tried to defang in July after they had investigated his close associates.\n\nMr. Zelensky, who was elected president in 2019, entered politics pledging to root out the graft that has long plagued Ukraine. But allegations of insider deals and corruption have continued during his administration, particularly in the energy sector.\n\nInstead of backing off under pressure from Mr. Zelensky, the anti-corruption agencies seem to be doubling down on their scrutiny of the country’s leaders. In their investigation into the state-owned electricity provider, the agencies said they had compiled 1,000 hours of audio recordings over 15 months and had documented “the activities of a high-level criminal organization.”\n\nMembers of the organization had “built a large-scale corruption scheme to influence strategic state-sector enterprises,” in particular Energoatom, the government-owned nuclear company, the agencies said in a news release.\n\nOleksandr Abakumov, a top anti-corruption detective, said in a video on social media that the agencies had performed more than 70 searches in the investigation, which they are calling “Midas.” The agencies said they had uncovered corruption that included money laundering and illicit enrichment.\n\nThe announcement came as Ukraine struggled to recover from one of the most serious attacks on its power grid in years. Early on Saturday, Russian missiles and drones targeted the country’s energy and gas infrastructure, hitting at least 25 locations, including nuclear power substations.\n\nDmytro Lytvyn, an adviser to Mr. Zelensky, said on Monday that the president’s office supported any attempt to root out corruption in state-owned companies but could not comment on the investigation because all the details were not public.\n\nMr. Zelensky had earlier announced negotiations with Ukraine’s partners in Europe to get more funding and equipment for the country’s energy system.\n\nEnergoatom said it was fully cooperating with the investigation.\n\nThe news release by the anti-corruption agencies, and the slickly produced videos that followed, showed they were continuing to dig into suspected schemes after Mr. Zelensky reversed his legislative efforts to neuter the agencies in July. He backed down after young Ukrainians took to the streets, saying the country’s democracy must be protected.\n\nThe anti-corruption agencies said a recording released Monday was of government officials and businessmen on July 9 discussing the embezzlement of funds that were intended to protect the energy sector from shelling. It was impossible to verify the authenticity of the recording or to know for certain who was talking and what their words meant.\n\nThe agencies did not name those they were accusing of crimes. But in a YouTube video posted on Monday, the agencies said members of the criminal organization included a former adviser to the minister of energy, the executive director for physical protection and security at Energoatom, four members of a team responsible for money laundering, and “a businessman well known in the media” whom they accused of leading the illicit enterprise. The agencies added that contractors were pressured for kickbacks of up to 15 percent.\n\nThe head of Energoatom resigned in August under unclear circumstances. Last week, the anti-corruption agencies arrested a top official of an Energoatom subsidiary on bribery allegations.\n\nA recent report by an independent Ukrainian think tank that focuses on energy said the government had rapidly expanded its control of the energy sector after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\n“This shift has not reduced corruption; in many cases, corrupt practices have persisted or worsened,” said the think tank, the Ukraine Facility Platform, which did the report in July for the European Union.\n\nWhen Mr. Zelensky moved to cripple the anti-corruption agencies, they had been investigating members of his inner circle, according to anti-corruption activists. Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov was charged with corruption in June. And the businessman Timur Mindich, who is half-owner of a television studio started by Mr. Zelensky, is the subject of a large-scale investigation, according to the newspaper Ukrainska Pravda.\n\nAn anti-corruption investigator who was arrested in July on what his supporters call politically motivated charges had been involved in the investigation into Mr. Mindich, said Yaroslav Zhelezniak, an opposition member of Parliament.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Mr. Zhelezniak said he had gathered material showing corruption in Energoatom and had given it to the anti-corruption agencies. He said some of it had been folded into the investigation announced Monday.\n\n“I’m very happy that I was right,” Mr. Zhelezniak said, adding that he thought this was one of the biggest corruption scandals ever uncovered in Ukraine.\n\nThe National Anti-Corruption Bureau raided the home of Mr. Mindich on Monday, Ukrainska Pravda reported. Hours before, Mr. Mindich fled the country, it said. These developments could not be independently confirmed.\n\nAnother newspaper, The Kyiv Independent, reported in August that the anti-corruption agency was examining ties between Mr. Mindich and a weapons manufacturer, Fire Point. The company has denied business ties to Mr. Mindich.\n\nConstant Méheut, Andrew E. Kramer and Oleksandra Mykolyshyn contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/07/theater/black-broadway-shuffle-hamilton.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"17:17:47-05:00","title":"Black Musical Theater, 200 Years and Running","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article explores the deep historical roots of Black musical theater in the United States, tracing its lineage from early 19th-century performances at the African Grove theater to major 20th-century productions like 'Shuffle Along,' 'In Dahomey,' and 'Porgy and Bess.'

stage in a crowded room.\n\nA collage of recent stage productions including “Hamilton,” “Dreamgirls,” “The Lion King” and the 2016 “Shuffle Along.”\n\nMany people think of the rise of Black musicals as a recent phenomenon.\n\nA collage of recent stage productions including “Hamilton,” “Dreamgirls,” “The Lion King” and the 2016 “Shuffle Along.”\n\nA collage of recent stage productions including “Hamilton,” “Dreamgirls,” “The Lion King” and the 2016 “Shuffle Along.”\n\nIn the 2016 show “Shuffle Along,” subtitled “The Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed,” the playwright and director George C. Wolfe argued …\n\n… that Black musical theater began on Broadway almost a century earlier.\n\nIn 1920, the songwriting team of Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake met …\n\n… the comedy team of Flournoy Miller and Aubrey Lyles at a benefit for the N.A.A.C.P.\n\nTheir “Shuffle Along,” about love and fraud in a fictional Dixieland, was the most successful early Broadway musical by an all-Black creative team, with an all-Black company and an all-Black orchestra.\n\nA publicity photo showing a group of women in large hats.\n\nThe lighthearted romp earned $9 million — more than $160 million today. It kick-started the careers of Josephine Baker, Paul Robeson, Florence Mills and Adelaide Hall.\n\nAn illustrated poster for “I’m Just Wild About Harry.”\n\nIts hit number, a jaunty fox trot called “I’m Just Wild About Harry,” was still popular enough 27 years later to make a successful theme song for Harry S. Truman’s presidential campaign.\n\nAn illustrated poster for “I’m Just Wild About Harry.”\n\nBut if “Shuffle Along” was a breakthrough, it was hardly the beginning of Black musical theater. For that you have to go back another 100 years.\n\nAmong the more than 270 items in “Syncopated Stages: Black Disruptions to the Great White Way,” an exhibition running through Feb. 21 at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, is a scale model of a 300-seat Greenwich Village theater called the African Grove.\n\nIn the early 1820s, even before the full abolition of slavery in New York State, it showcased the work of Black artists for mostly Black audiences.\n\nAn 1821 production of “Richard III,” starring the company’s co-founder James Hewlett, was favorably reviewed in the white press for both its songs and its Shakespeare.\n\nAnother member of the company, Ira Aldridge, soon became a noted classical actor — but only in Europe, where he achieved widespread acclaim performing before royalty in grand opera houses.\n\nThat his success came mostly for “Moorish” roles, including his famous “Othello,” demonstrates the limitations under which even the most successful Black performers struggled. Yet the struggle is not itself the achievement.\n\nIs it possible to see through the conditions that shaped and stymied Black artists to the art itself?\n\nIn a letter displayed in the exhibition, Wolfe puts his finger on the problem.\n\nA letter written by George C. Wolfe, with parts of the text highlighted.<em> </em>\n\nResponding to an early draft of “Bring in ’Da Noise, Bring in ’Da Funk,” the 1996 musical about what he calls the “regenerative power of rhythm” in Black history …\n\nA letter written by George C. Wolfe, with parts of the text highlighted.<em> </em>\n\n… he notes that viewing the subject through the lens of racism is “incredibly reductive.”\n\nA letter written by George C. Wolfe, with parts of the text highlighted.<em> </em>\n\n“It’s like a cure-all, when in doubt, whip out the ‘whitefolks’ and everybody understands everything,” he wrote in a fax to members of the production team.\n\nA letter written by George C. Wolfe, with parts of the text highlighted.<em> </em>\n\n“I’m not interested in this at all. It’s the difference between talking about slavery and instead talking about slave culture. One is about what white people did to black people — the other is about what black people did for themselves.”\n\nA portrait of Anna Madah Hyers and Emma Louise Hyers.\n\nConsider the Hyers Sisters. Anna Madah Hyers and Emma Louise Hyers were classically trained singers who as children performed in private homes and concert halls.\n\nAfter the Civil War, they and their father formed a touring theater company. Their first show, in 1876, was the musical drama “Out of Bondage,” about the sorrows of slavery and the joys of emancipation.\n\nThat play, along with later Hyers productions like “The Underground Railway” and “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” marked the beginning of American musical theater’s emergence as a distinct form from its predecessors.\n\nAmong those predecessors was the minstrel show, which traded in offensive racial stereotypes.\n\nA poster for the Thatcher Primrose & West’s Minstrels show,\n\nMinstrel shows usually featured white performers — and even Black ones — in blackface.\n\nThe sheet music for “Carry Me Back to Old Virginny.”\n\nWith or without blackface, racial stereotypes and performative servility remained popular. Some Black artists, having little choice if they wanted to work, fed the demand.\n\nIn “Carry Me Back to Old Virginny,” written by James A. Bland around 1878, a formerly enslaved man sings that there’s “no place on Earth do I love more sincerely” than the place “where I labored so hard for old Massa.” From 1940 to 1997, despite a racial slur in the lyric, it was Virginia’s state song.\n\nIn 1898, the composer Will Marion Cook and the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar brought their musical “Clorindy, or the Origin of the Cakewalk” to Broadway, seeking (as Cook wrote) to “eschew white patterns” of Black representation.\n\nEven so, its songs, like “Darktown Is Out To-Night” and “Who Dat Say Chicken in Dis Crowd,” reflected the prevailing tone of the day.\n\nErnest Hogan, the star of “Clorindy” and a popular composer himself, felt it was important to document the newly emergent Black musical styles. But he came to regret some of the songs he wrote or popularized, with lyrics that would seem shocking today.\n\nWhether they played to stereotypes or against them, or both, Black artists worked to achieve control over their careers. “Syncopated Stages,” curated by the historian Michael Dinwiddie, who died in July, highlights that fight for professional dignity.\n\nBorn in Virginia in the late 1860s, the singer Sissieretta Jones, dubbed the “Black Patti” after the great Italian soprano Adelina Patti, became an opera star in Europe. But when she performed in the United States, Jones was paid far less than white singers. Around 1886 she founded her own troupe.\n\nIn 1908, led by the vaudevillian George Walker, a group of Black entertainers formed a professional society called The Frogs, in part to counter their exclusion from racist entertainment unions like The White Rats. Their influence helped Black acts demand top billing in national bookings.\n\nAmong them were Walker (right) and his comedy partner, Bert Williams, one of the most popular vaudeville acts of the period.\n\nBob Cole and J. Rosamond Johnson starred in several of their own musicals.\n\nThe bandleader and composer James Reese Europe was called “the Martin Luther King of Music.”\n\nEurope’s catchy dance tune “The Castle Walk” became the toast of (white) Broadway.\n\nIn 1910, Europe founded the Clef Club, another Black professional society, this one for musicians.\n\nTo help finance the society, Europe led performances of the Clef Club Orchestra in a series of concerts at Carnegie Hall starting in 1912.\n\nThe Clef Club’s chorus was led by Will Marion Cook, the “Clorindy” composer and a classically trained violinist.\n\nWhile breaking down professional barriers, Cook and others were slowly changing the way musical theater presented Black characters and stories.\n\nThough performed partly in blackface, two of Cook’s later Broadway shows, “In Dahomey” (1903) …\n\n… and “Abyssinia” (1906), explored the possibility of emigration to Africa.\n\nThese shows were the product of a tight-knit network of collaborations with like-minded artists, including Williams and Walker and their wives: Lottie Williams …\n\n… and Aida Overton Walker. Overton Walker, having met her future husband when they both appeared in Sissieretta Jones’s troupe, took over some of his roles, in drag, after his death.\n\nCook’s wife, Abbie Mitchell, made her debut in “Clorindy” at 14, later appearing in the original productions of “Porgy and Bess” and “The Little Foxes.”\n\n“Porgy and Bess” (1935) is now a highly contested text: an opera about Black characters written by white people.\n\nYet it has also provided opportunities for generations of Black musical theater artists, including the influential tap star John W. Bubbles.\n\n“Porgy and Bess” does not fit comfortably into Wolfe’s schema of “what black people did for themselves.” It borrows from Black life and Black music. But in musical theater, borrowing is a two-way street. “The Wiz,” in 1975, was in no way the first Black musical to reframe a story originally written about others.\n\nIn 1939, “The Swing Mikado” and “The Hot Mikado” — Black versions of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta — both appeared on Broadway.\n\n“The Hot Mikado” starred the great dancer Bill Robinson in the title role.\n\nOne of the “three little maids from school” was a young performer named Rosetta LeNoire.\n\nIn 1968, in the midst of a long career on Broadway — often playing maids, she noted — LeNoire founded Amas Musical Theater, partly to promote multiethnic casting. Amas would nurture some of the hits of a new era for Black musical theater, including “Mama, I Want to Sing!” and “Bubbling Brown Sugar.”\n\nBy then, Black musical theater had been completely absorbed into American musical theater. The forms that have dominated Broadway since the 1940s trace their lineage not only to operettas and shtetls but also to gospel choirs, juke joints and jazz clubs.\n\nPerformers from “Hot Feet” standing with arms raised.\n\nWhen you look at its staging of a number from the 1929 musical “Hot Feet” …\n\n… it’s hard not to see the staging of “Cabaret” on Broadway 40 years later.\n\nMembers of the “Shuffle Along” cast all wearing big round hats.\n\nOr to see the 1975 “Chicago” in the 1921 “Shuffle Along.”\n\nStage production image of the musical “Hamilton.”\n\nThe world of kick lines, cakewalks and clarinet licks is in many ways the creation of Black artists. It was what they “did for themselves,” as Wolfe says. But once they had done it, it was for everyone.\n\nProduced by Josephine Sedgwick and Rebecca Lieberman.Images: Connie’s Inn (Elcha via New York Public Library); “Dreamgirls” (Martha Swope via New York Public Library); “Hamilton,” “The Lion King,” “Bring in ’Da Noise, Bring in ’Da Funk,” “The Color Purple,” and 2016 “Shuffle Along” (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times); 1921 “Shuffle Along” cast (via New York Public Library); Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake (Lewis Smith via New York Public Library); Flournoy Miller and Aubrey Lyles (Apeda Studio via New York Public Library); “Shuffle Along” publicity photo (via New York Public Library); “Shuffle Along” orchestra (White Studio via New York Public Library); \"I'm Just Wild About Harry” sheet music (via New York Public Library); African Grove model (NYU Gallatin); African Grove playbill (via New York Public Library); James Hewlett (Parisen and John Scoles via New York Public Library); Ira Aldridge (Simon Bühler via New York Public Library); fax from George C.
