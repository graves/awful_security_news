champion Vladimir Kramnik is being investigated for bullying and harassment following the death of fellow player  Daniel Naroditsky , world chess governing body  FIDE has announced .\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky, an American chess grandmaster who amassed a large online following through streaming and teaching, died unexpectedly at the age of 29, according to a statement released by his family via the Charlotte Chess Center on Monday. No cause of death was announced.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik’s campaign had taken on him.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,”  he said , adding: “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing and  wrote on X  Thursday that he hopes the “real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organization “thought that Vladimir’s accusations were reckless and ungrounded.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Our fair play commission is looking into that. And I personally, and our management board, decided to pass it to our ethics commission for investigation, an independent investigation. We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity — in sports, in chess in particular.”\n \n\n   \n  Dvorkovich explained that “any kind of sanction is possible” for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich  said  in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.\n \n\n   \n  “The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by  CNN Sports , Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE’s investigation as “insulting,” “unfair” and “orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones”\n \n\n   \n  He added in the interview: “The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.”\n \n\n   \n  According to  The Associated Press , Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Since Naroditsky’s death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct “ horrible ” and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura  describing  his campaign against perceived cheating as “nonsense” and “insane.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,” streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.”\n \n\n   \n  Without naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin  wrote  on X that Naroditsky had faced “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations” which caused “immense pressure and pain.”\n \n\n   \n  “Daniel’s smile faded after the attacks began,” Sarin added.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a “rapidly spreading desease (sic)” in a “fair play in chess” fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by FIDE – before he was a senior in high school.\n \n\n   \n  A popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on  his YouTube channel  and 340,000 followers on  Twitch , as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on “The Lead,” FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as “a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator.

Patrick Morrisey exceeded his authority when he authorized the Guard’s deployment in August.\n \n\n   \n  “The question before this court is whether or not state law allows West Virginia to do this,” Lindsay said. “The court has found that.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge added: “This court believes that the federal law allows for the request made by the president to the governor.”\n \n\n   \n   West Virginia is among several states  that sent National Guard members to the nation’s capital.

The state attorney general’s office sought to reject the case, saying the group has not been harmed and lacked standing to challenge Morrisey’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a simple issue of a broad, lawful request by the president and a lawful deployment by the governor.

And that’s not how the law works. We remain deeply concerned about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump issued an executive order in August declaring a crime emergency in the nation’s capital, although the Department of Justice itself says violent crime there is at  a 30-year low .\n \n\n   \n  Within a month, more than 2,300 Guard troops  from eight states  and the District of Columbia were patrolling under the Army secretary’s command.

British Muslim journalist Sami Hamdi, who has been held by US federal immigration for over two weeks, is set to be released and allowed to return to the UK.\n \n\n   \n  The London-based journalist and commentator, who was visiting the United States on a speaking tour,  was detained  by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last month as he went through San Francisco International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. But Muslim advocacy groups say that his visa was revoked during his trip without cause or prior notice. Hamdi’s family believe his public criticism of Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories was the real reason behind the decision.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said Hamdi had opted to accept a US government offer to leave the country voluntarily.\n \n\n   \n  “The government has agreed to release Sami,” Hamdi’s family said in a statement posted on social media Monday. “He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.”\n \n\n   \n  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that Hamdi had voluntarily requested removal from the US and ICE was “happily arranging his removal from this country” in a statement Monday. McLaughlin characterized Hamdi as “an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer” and said “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  ICE records show Hamdi was still in custody in California Monday afternoon. He was detained on October 26, a day after speaking at CAIR’s annual gala in California.\n \n\n   \n  CAIR’s California chapter and Hamdi’s lawyer on Monday welcomed the US decision to release the British national.\n \n\n   \n  “This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Hamdi’s wife Soumaya said the US government provided “no evidence” to justify his detention.\n \n\n   \n  “If they want him out of the country, why not simply let him go?” she posted to Instagram. “Why is the US government holding a British journalist without charge?”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his analysis on developments in the Middle East and appearances on British TV.  He had recently spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance.\n \n\n   \n  At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, Hamdi called on the audience to “celebrate the victory.” However, in a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “People are saying October 7 was a natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell,” CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said on Monday. “His only real ‘offense’ was speaking clearly about Israel’s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student  Momodou Taal  had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen has accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the Israel-Hamas war.

Jean Carroll \n       \n  By Kara Scannell, John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:25 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Monday asked the US Supreme Court to review the $5 million civil case that found he sexually abused and defamed magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, a federal appeals court affirmed the jury’s  verdict and $5 million judgment  against Trump, ruling the trial judge did not make errors that would warrant a new trial. In June, Trump  lost an effort   to have the appeal reviewed by the full bench of judges.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has claimed Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw the civil trial, made numerous errors by allowing the jury to hear testimony from two women who alleged Trump sexually assaulted them years ago.\n \n\n   \n  His lawyers also said the judge should not have let the jurors see the  “Access Hollywood tape, ” which captured Trump in 2005 on a hot mic saying he gropes and kisses women.\n \n\n   \n  Carroll sued Trump alleging he sexually assaulted her in a New York department store in the mid-1990s and defamed her when in 2019 he denied the assault, said she wasn’t his type, and claimed she made it up to boost sales of a book.\n \n\n   \n  “There were no eyewitnesses, no video evidence, and no police report or investigation,” Trump told the Supreme Court in the appeal filed Monday viewed by CNN. “Instead, Carroll waited more than 20 years to falsely accuse Donald Trump, who she politically opposes, until after he became the 45th president, when she could maximize political injury to him and profit for herself.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal has not yet been formally docketed at the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Whether the Supreme Court takes up the case is yet to be seen, but it likely won’t be the last time the justices are asked to review litigation involving Carroll.\n \n\n   \n  A different jury found Trump liable for defaming Carroll for repeating his statements in 2022 and ordered him to pay $83 million in damages. A federal appeals court panel  affirmed the damages award  finding it “reasonable in light of the extraordinary and egregious facts” and rejected several of Trump’s legal challenges. Among them, the appeals court found that Trump had previously waived any claim of presidential immunity and said the Supreme Court’s decision last year involving criminal cases did not alter their view.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has asked for the full bench of judges to review the case. The Justice Department filed an amicus brief supporting review of whether presidential immunity can be waived “from civil damages liability predicated on official acts.”  Carroll’s response is due in the next few weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/trump-pardons-political-transactional","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:12:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s Pardons Aren’t Just Political; More Importantly, They’re Transactional","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has issued over 1,650 pardons and commutations during his two terms, with the majority targeting allies involved in politically sensitive actions — including efforts to overturn the 2020 election and actions during investigations into Russian interference.

importantly, they’re transactional \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:12 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  So much of the coverage of President Donald Trump’s pardons is focused on how political they are. And they are certainly political — extraordinarily so.\n \n\n   \n  But as Trump’s  latest batch of pardons  reinforces, that’s only half the story.\n \n\n   \n  The more ominous trend is not just that he’s pardoning political allies; it’s that he’s pardoning allies  in very transactional ways .\n \n\n   \n  He’s pardoning lots and lots of people who helped Trump, specifically.\n \n\n   \n  After previously dangling pardons over allies involved in sensitive investigations involving Trump himself — and later delivering those pardons — he’s now pardoned oodles of people who took illegal or legally dubious action on his behalf.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is creating a permission structure in which people will credibly think they can’t be held accountable in federal court, as long as what they’re doing benefits Trump. He’s been cultivating this for a long time, but he seems to be getting more brazen about it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s most recent pardons, which were announced overnight by Justice Department official Ed Martin, are for 77 people who played roles in trying to overturn his 2020 election loss. These officials include former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell and the president’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, along with many of the people involved in the so-called fake electors scheme.\n \n\n   \n  The pardons are symbolic, in that these people haven’t actually been charged with federal crimes. Some of them face state-level charges, for which Trump cannot pardon them.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s also what makes these so notable. Trump is using this symbolic gesture to expand the ranks of people who went to great and legally dubious lengths to help him try to overturn the 2020 election and who later received pardons.\n \n\n   \n  When you combine these new pardons with the pardons and commutations given to  January 6, 2021, defendants  and Trump allies who testified in cases involving the president, across his two terms Trump has now pardoned more than 1,650 people who played significant roles in matters involving him personally.\n \n\n   \n  Those people account for more than 84% of pardons and commutations awarded by Trump. (Trump has otherwise  been remarkably stingy  with his clemency powers, when the matters didn’t involve him or his allies.)\n \n\n   \n  And many of these people engaged in violence,  including against police , in the name of helping Trump.\n \n\n   \n  What message does that send to other people who might go to remarkable lengths to help Trump carry out his agenda? To participate in legally dubious administration actions — things like  its boat strikes in the Caribbean ? To carry out his deportation agenda in rather brutal ways? Or to perhaps even try to help him stay in power, as more than 1,600 people did before receiving pardons for their actions?\n \n\n   \n  The sheer volume of these self-serving pardons is hardly the only indicator that Trump is wielding them for political and transactional purposes.\n \n\n   \n  Official reports from the various Russia investigations referred to how Trump  appeared to dangle pardons  over people who were in positions to provide potentially derogatory information about him. These people included former advisers Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn.\n \n\n   \n  Special counsel Robert Mueller  said in his report  that Trump’s repeated comments about potentially pardoning Manafort “had the potential to influence Manafort’s decision whether to cooperate with the government.”\n \n\n   \n  All were later pardoned by Trump in his first term. And perhaps most notably, Trump’s pardon of Manafort came after Manafort lied to investigators in ways that threw them off in a key portion of the probe.\n \n\n   \n  Manafort’s lies came after he cut a deal to cooperate with investigators. A bipartisan Senate report seemed to  regard these lies as particularly inexplicable , given they opened Manafort up to much more prison time.\n \n\n   \n  But ultimately, Manafort’s gamble appeared to pay off with Trump, when the president gave him the pardon he had repeatedly dangled as a potential reward for staying loyal.\n \n\n   \n  Both the Mueller report and the Senate report also referred to how Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said he was led to believe the Trump White House would help him with his pardon  if he stayed in line.\n \n\n   \n  Cohen told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he discussed a potential pardon with a  fellow Trump lawyer more than half a dozen times. He said the lawyer told him after he testified to Congress that Trump “heard that you did great, and don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine. He loves ya.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuliani himself also publicly floated pardons related to witnesses in the Russia investigation. He at one point  told the New York Daily News  that when “the whole thing is over, things might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons.” He  told CNN  around the same time that “When it’s over, hey, he’s the president of the United States. He retains his pardon power. Nobody is taking that away from him.”\n \n\n   \n  And then there are the comments of another lawyer who figured prominently in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election, John Eastman.\n \n\n   \n  Just a few days after the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Eastman  emailed Giuliani , saying, “I’ve decided that I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works.”\n \n\n   \n  We still don’t know who was keeping such a “pardon list,” or why. But it signaled that those around Trump seemed to sense their actions were at least legally problematic and were preparing accordingly very shortly after January 6.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, some involved had either been  told their plans were illegal or acknowledged it  in the days and weeks beforehand, but they pressed forward anyway. Then they rather quickly seemed to start talking about pardons.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly five years later, Eastman has joined Giuliani in actually being on a Trump “pardon list.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/baseball-mlb-announces-gambling-safeguards","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:50:00Z","title":"MLB Announces New Gambling Safeguards After Guardians Pitchers Indicted in Betting Scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the indictment of Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz on charges of conspiring to rig pitches for fraudulent sports betting, Major League Baseball has implemented new safeguards to address pitch-level betting risks.

      \nUpdated: \n        5:15 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two clashes between rival gangs in a southern Ecuadorian prison left at least 31 inmates dead on Sunday, including 27 who were killed by “asphyxiation,” officials said.\n \n\n   \n  In the first attack, the criminal group  Los Lobos  was targeted by a breakaway gang known as Sao-Box in the early morning, Interior Minister John Reimberg said Monday in an interview with Radio Centro Ecuador. At least four inmates in the Machala Detention Center were reported killed and roughly 36 were wounded. Two officers suffered nonserious injuries as authorities stepped in to regain control of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the day, Los Lobos carried out a “reprisal” attack against Sao-Box, killing 27 of its members by asphyxiating them inside several cells that both groups shared, according to Reimberg.\n \n\n   \n  “In retaliation, Lobos asphyxiated members of the other organization to avoid leaving signs of violence on their bodies,” the minister said.\n \n\n   \n  Prison guards discovered the bodies around 6 p.m. while carrying out routine inspections.\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s penitentiary system SNAI said in a previous statement Sunday that the inmates had “committed asphyxiation among themselves, which resulted in immediate death by suspension.” Authorities did not immediately clarify what they meant by “asphyxiation” or say whether the inmates were hanged.\n \n\n   \n  In response to inquiries from the press, including CNN, SNAI said Sunday that “authorities, operational teams and forensic medical personnel continue working at the scene, verifying information and attending to reported emergencies.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked why rival gang members shared cells, Reimberg noted that they were initially part of the same group, before Sao-Box broke off from Los Lobos over management disputes. He did not specify why they were still kept in the same place after the split.\n \n\n   \n  The first attack on Sunday was prompted by the transfer of inmates to a new maximum-security facility, SNAI said without providing details.\n \n\n   \n  Reimberg suggested that inmates across the country have been causing chaos to prevent authorities from transferring them to the new prison.\n \n\n   \n  The attacks in Machala are the latest in a series of deadly prison clashes throughout Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n  In September, a confrontation between rival gangs at a prison in the coastal city of Esmeraldas left at least  17 dead , according to the National Police. Three days earlier, an additional 14 inmates were killed in Machala.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2021, more than 500 inmates have died in Ecuador’s prisons, according to official figures.\n \n\n   \n  The wave of prison violence is happening despite the deployment of military and police forces in several penitentiaries. It’s part of an ongoing state of internal armed conflict that the government declared in January 2024 to try to quell criminal violence nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  Los Lobos is one of two Ecuadorian criminal groups that the United States said it would designate as foreign terrorist organizations in September. The designation allows the US to impose sanctions and share intelligence with Ecuador “that can be actioned for potentially lethal operations,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at the time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/tina-peters-pardon-push-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:34:00-05:00","title":"Trump Being Urged to Intervene in Tina Peters Case, Sources Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tina Peters, a former Republican clerk from Mesa, Colorado, was convicted on state charges of participating in a scheme to prove false claims of mass voter fraud in the 2020 election, resulting in a nine-year prison sentence.

Tina Peters case, sources say \n       \n  By Kaitlan Collins, Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:34 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fresh off of  pardoning a slew of allies  who helped him try to overturn the 2020 election, President Donald Trump is being strongly encouraged to intervene in the conviction of Tina Peters, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Peters, the former Republican clerk of Mesa, Colorado, was found guilty last year on state charges of participating in a scheme that hoped to prove Trump’s false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020. She was sentenced to nine years in prison and is serving her sentence at a women’s prison in Pueblo, Colorado. However, because she was found guilty on state charges, Trump cannot outright pardon her — that power belongs to Colorado’s Democratic governor. But that hasn’t stopped her allies from trying to get her out of prison.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people making the biggest push internally on her behalf is Ed Martin, who is serving as the pardon attorney at the Justice Department after he failed to get enough support to serve as the US attorney in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has continued to advocate for relief for Peters in recent weeks, several people familiar with the push told CNN, even though it is extremely unusual for the Justice Department to intervene in a state case this way. The department has already  involved itself  in a long-shot federal case, known as a habeas petition, that Peters filed in March, and urged a federal judge to free her from state prison while she appeals her conviction. That matter is still pending, but a decision is expected this year.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has worked behind the scenes, over the objections of some of his colleagues, to find a way to grant relief for Peters. Responding Sunday to a post about the case on X, Martin wrote, “We are working on it!”\n \n\n   \n  During her sentencing hearing, Peters continued to argue that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump. Colorado state Judge Matthew Barrett told Peters that he was convinced she was not apologetic for her behavior and “would do it all over again if you could.”\n \n\n   \n  “You are no hero,” Barrett told her. “You abused your position and you’re a charlatan.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump lost in 2020, Peters got involved with other right-wing activists who tried to prove Trump’s fraud claims by allegedly breaching voting systems in Colorado,  Michigan ,  Georgia  and other states. They were acting based on false information, including from Trump’s own lawyers, that the 2020 results were rigged against him by machines belonging to Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic.\n \n\n   \n  Peters was  indicted  by a Republican prosecutor and convicted by a jury in her ruby-red county of felonies tied to a data breach in Mesa related to the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly threatened “harsh measures” against Colorado if Peters isn’t freed and has  called  her an “innocent political prisoner.”\n \n\n   \n  He has criticized Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and state Attorney General Phil Weiser, both Democrats. Polis  has said  he won’t pardon Peters as part of any quid-pro-quo deal.\n \n\n   \n  From the La Vista Correctional Facility — a medium-security women’s prison in Pueblo — Peters has continued her advocacy through messages to her allies that they post on social media on her behalf. Last month, she directed her outrage at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “Where is everybody? I did what I was supposed to do” to “legally” expose supposed voter fraud in 2020, Peters wrote, adding, “The President has demanded my release four times… why is the DOJ defying Trump’s demands? Get off your a**es and get me out!”\n \n\n   \n  Peters has apparently latched onto an idea  recently floated  by those on the right that the Justice Department can move her from state prison into a more comfortable federal facility, because she needs protection as a witness in a potential federal probe into supposed 2020 voter fraud.\n \n\n   \n  To that end, her attorneys have claimed they have critical new evidence about the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  They have used her habeas petition to publicize new depositions that they took over the summer, supposedly of anonymous Venezuelan informants who said Dominion and Smartmatic machines can rig American elections — the same false claim that Trump, Peters and other election deniers have peddled since November 2020.\n \n\n   \n  But at a recent hearing, Federal Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak ruled that the depositions weren’t admissible in the habeas case. He also observed that “we’ve seen neither hide nor hair” of the Justice Department in the months after DOJ officials participated an April hearing about its unorthodox intervention in Peters’ case.\n \n\n   \n  Martin confirmed Monday on Trump ally Steve Bannon’s podcast that the Justice Department wants to see Peters moved to a federal prison.\n \n\n   \n  “(Deputy Attorney General) Todd Blanche is the guy leading on this. We did it in a way that puts the right kind of pressure on them,” Martin said of the Trump administration’s contacts with Colorado officials. “If you’re Colorado … if the feds say we want something, you change your tune.”\n \n\n   \n  A person familiar with the matter previously told CNN that Polis and Weiser, who is defending Peters’ convictions in state and federal courts, are “fully synced up” on how to resist Trump’s pressure campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s doing her time,” the person said. “We don’t let threats affect us. We have a job to do and we’re going to do it. We are going to uphold the law.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Polis’ and Weiser’s offices for comment.\n \n\n   \n  One of Peters’ lawyers, Patrick McSweeney, previously told CNN that Peters hasn’t had any direct contact with Trump from behind bars, but she has heard about his desire to get her out, and “she appreciates the president’s interest in her case, which is unusual for him to be involved in an individual matter.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/david-szalay-flesh-booker-prize-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:57:00-05:00","title":"Writer David Szalay wins prestigious Booker Prize for fiction with his earthy novel ‘Flesh’","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Szalay, a Canadian-Hungarian-British writer, has won the 2025 Booker Prize for Fiction for his novel 'Flesh,' which tells the life story of István, a taciturn Hungarian immigrant, over several decades.

Mostafa Salem, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:02 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Less than a year after his lightning power grab, Syria’s president is capping his transformation from jihadist to global statesman in a historic visit to the White House that says as much about the young leader as it does his push for his country’s diplomatic reinvention.\n \n\n   \n  Ahmed Al-Sharaa’s meeting on Monday – the first ever visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state – is his 20th foreign trip since appointing himself as president of  Syria  in January, and his second visit to the United States, following his attendance of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.\n \n\n   \n  But this meeting was  ﻿ the most high-profile and high stakes yet, a once-unthinkable encounter between the US commander-in-chief and a man who has faced American forces on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a very strong leader,” US President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office following Monday’s visit, adding: “He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy. I like him. I get along with him … and we’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time Trump has praised the Syrian leader. In May, after a brief  meeting  brokered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump hailed the 43-year-old Syrian leader as a “young, attractive guy” with a “very strong past,” and ordered the lifting of some of the crippling US sanctions on Syria, a country that for decades had been firmly aligned with key American foes Russia and Iran.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the US extended its pause on most sanctions for another 180 days. However, the most stringent sanctions on Damascus remain and cannot be fully lifted without congressional approval. Al-Sharaa’s immediate goal in Washington was to push for their removal while urging Trump to pressure Israel to halt attacks on Syria and withdraw its troops from the south of the country.\n \n\n   \n  His broader objective, reflected in his extensive global travel, is to reverse Syria’s isolation, a legacy of the previous regime that left the country economically devasted and diplomatically shackled to a narrow axis of allies.\n \n\n   \n  Against this backdrop, the White House visit carries profound symbolic weight. Al-Sharaa played basketball with top US military officials after arriving in Washington on Sunday. But in his early twenties, he encountered the US as an enemy, joining Islamist insurgents battling American forces in Iraq. Captured and later released, he crossed into Syria in 2011 and established an Al-Qaeda-backed rebel army to fight forces loyal to then-President Bashar Al Assad.\n \n\n   \n  Trump nodded to Al-Sharaa’s multilayered past on Monday, saying: “We’ve all had rough pasts, but he has had a rough past. And I think, frankly, if you didn’t have a rough past, you wouldn’t have a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN last December, Al-Sharaa said he had gone through episodes of transformation through the years.  Using his nom de guerre , he said: “A person in their twenties will have a different personality than someone in their thirties or forties, and certainly someone in their fifties. This is human nature.”\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s visit demonstrated that shift: Syria is expected to announce that it is joining the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, a senior Trump administration official said, making Syria the 90th member of the D-ISIS Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sharaa’s Syria will partner with the US “to eliminate ISIS remnants and halt foreign fighter flows,” the official said, adding that the visit is focused on “counterterrorism cooperation, economic development, and advancing regional peace and security.”\n \n\n   \n  After more than a decade of a brutal conflict against Assad’s autocratic regime, Al-Sharaa ended Syria’s long-stalemated civil war by launching a surprise offensive that swiftly toppled the 53-year Assad dynasty, an Arab relic of the Cold War.\n \n\n   \n  In their decades of power, the Assads aligned Damascus firmly with Moscow, relying on aid, arms and unwavering diplomatic backing. In Hafez al-Assad’s first full year in power in 1971, the Soviet Union established its strategic Mediterranean naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus. And it was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decisive military intervention in 2015 that enabled Bashar al-Assad to survive the civil war.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians, who killed scores of Syrians during their campaign to keep Assad in power, continue to retain control of their military base in Tartus even after Assad’s fall. And last month, Al-Sharaa visited Moscow to meet Putin.\n \n\n   \n  As he has sought to build ties with Western nations, Al-Sharaa has been careful not to antagonize Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “Engaging in a conflict with Russia right now would be too costly with Syria, nor would it be in the country’s interest,” Al-Sharaa told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview aired in October.\n \n\n   \n  Once sanctioned for terrorism by the West, the leader now appears to be on a global diplomatic charm offensive, bolstered by aggressive lobbying from regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Turkey, US allies eager to fill a power and economic vacuum left by Iran and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  For the US, Syria represents both a strategic prize and a significant risk as neighboring Lebanon spirals into instability and Iraq remains a fertile ground for Iran’s proxy militias.\n \n\n   \n  “The US is taking a large gamble on Ahmed Al-Sharaa and Syria,” Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told CNN. “As (US) Ambassador (Tom) Barrack has stated numerous times, the US has no alternatives. Lebanon is a failed state according to his assessment. Iraq is deeply penetrated by pro-Iranian militias,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  And despite a clear westward outlook, the former jihadist leader remains adamant on balancing Syria’s foreign policy away from conflict in an increasingly polarized world – a policy now followed by several developing nations worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  “In this new era, one doesn’t align completely with any side. We saw that with (Al-Sharaa’s) visit with Putin, who is an active ally with the Assad regime … and you see that with diplomacy on behalf of the Syrian government globally,” Natasha Hall, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Fox, Jennifer Hansler, Dalia Abdelwahab, Jomana Karadsheh, Eyad Kourdi contributed reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/hannibal-gadhafi-released-lebanon-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"Hannibal Gadhafi, Son of Late Libyan Leader, Released from Lebanon After 10 Years in Detention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hannibal Gadhafi, son of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, was released from a 10-year detention in Lebanon after paying a $900,000 bail, following a reduction from $11 million and the lifting of a travel ban.

Two security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, also confirmed that Gadhafi was set free.\n \n\n   \n  “Hannibal is officially free and has the full right to choose the destination that he wants,” al-Khoury said. He refused to give further details about Gadhafi’s future movements out of security concerns.\n \n\n   \n  The release came days after Lebanese authorities lifted a travel ban and reduced the bail for Hannibal Gadhafi, paving the way for his release.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s decision by the country’s judicial authorities to lift the travel ban and reduce the bail from $11 million came days after a Libyan delegation visited Lebanon and made progress in talks for the release of Gadhafi.\n \n\n   \n  In mid-October, a Lebanese judge ordered Gadhafi’s release on $11 million bail, but banned him from traveling outside Lebanon. His lawyers said at the time that he didn’t have enough to pay that amount, and sought permission for him to leave the country.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, his bail was reduced to 80 billion Lebanese pounds (about $900,000) and the travel ban was lifted allowing him to leave the country once he pays the bail.\n \n\n   \n  The two judicial and one security official said the bail was paid by the Libyan delegation. The Justice Ministry of the Tripoli-based government also posted on its social media platforms that the Libyan delegation paid the bail.\n \n\n   \n  The judicial officials in Beirut said Gadhafi’s defense team withdrew a case against the Lebanese state that they had filed in Geneva last month over holding him without trial.\n \n\n   \n  Libya formally requested Hannibal Gadhafi’s release in 2023, citing his deteriorating health after he went on a hunger strike to protest his detention without trial.\n \n\n   \n  Detained in Lebanon in 2015, Gadhafi was accused of withholding information about the fate of Lebanese Shiite cleric Moussa al-Sadr who disappeared during a trip to Libya in 1978, although the late leader’s son was less than 3 years old at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Gadhafi had been living in exile in Syria with his Lebanese wife, Aline Skaf, and children until he was abducted in 2015 and brought to Lebanon by Lebanese militants who were demanding information about al-Sadr.\n \n\n   \n  Lebanese police later announced they had seized Gadhafi from the northeastern Lebanese city of Baalbek where he was being held, and he had been held ever since in a Beirut jail, where he faced questioning over al-Sadr’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  The case has been a long-standing sore point in Lebanon. The cleric’s family believes he may still be alive in a Libyan prison, though most Lebanese presume he is dead. He would be 96 years old.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sadr, who went missing with companions Abbas Badreddine and Mohammed Yacoub, was the founder of a Shiite political and military group that took part in the long Lebanese Civil War that began in 1975, largely pitting Muslims against Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Moammar Gadhafi was  killed by opposition fighters  during Libya’s 2011 uprising-turned-civil war, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.\n \n\n   \n  Hannibal Gadhafi, who was born nearly three years before al-Sadr disappeared, fled to Algeria after his father was toppled and Tripoli fell to opposition fighters, along with his mother and several other relatives. He later moved to Syria where he was given political asylum and stayed there until he was abducted.\n \n\n   \n  Moammar Gadhafi had eight children from two marriages. Most of them had significant roles in his government. His son Muatassim was killed at the same time as the leader was captured and slain. Two other sons, Saif al-Arab and Khamis, were killed in the uprising.\n \n\n   \n   Saif al-Islam , the one-time heir apparent to his father, has been in Libya since his release from detention there in 2017.

The lawsuits claim that Camp Mystic ignored known flood risks, failed to evacuate children from flood-prone cabins, and prioritized cost over safety, despite state-mandated evacuation plans. Key victims include 8-year-old Eloise 'Lulu' Peck and 9-year-old Ellen Getten, both housed in vulnerable cabins. The camp’s response timeline, which began with a warning at 1:14 a.m. and involved evacuation efforts by 2:19 a.m., has been disputed by families, who argue that a more proactive and timely evacuation could have saved lives.

CNN is reaching out to representatives for Camp Mystic and the Eastland family for their responses to the lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen campers and staffers –  the “Heaven’s 27,”  as they are known – died in the predawn hours of July 4 after torrential rainfall caused flash flooding at the century-old summer camp in Texas Hill Country.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the  youngest victims were housed  in cabins along the banks of the Guadalupe River.\n \n\n   \n  Richard “Dick” Eastland, who co-owned the  all-girls Christian  camp with his wife, Tweety, died while he was trying to save some of the girls, a family spokesperson has said.\n \n\n   \n  The flooding killed at least 136 people across the region, as parts of the Guadalupe River rose from about  3 feet to almost 30 feet in just 45 minutes .\n \n\n   \n     What the lawsuits allege \n \n\n   \n  The first lawsuit, filed by the families of five campers and two counselors, accuses Camp Mystic of not having adequate safety plans and prioritizing money over safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, campers Margaret, Lila, Molly, Lainey, and Blakely should be third graders, and counselors Chloe and Katherine should be freshmen at the University of Texas. They all are gone,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,” the filing says. “The Camp chose to house young girls in cabins sitting in flood-prone areas, despite the risk, to avoid the cost of relocating the cabins. The Camp chose not to make plans to safely evacuate its campers and counselors from those cabins, despite state rules requiring evacuation plans, and not to spend time and money on safety training and tools.”\n \n\n   \n  “On July 4, the Camp chose to take no steps to protect its campers and counselors while it knew a storm and ‘life threatening flash flooding’ were approaching,” the first lawsuit states. “Instead, with the river rising, the Camp chose to direct its groundskeepers to spend over an hour evacuating camp equipment, not its campers and counselors. The Camp chose not to evacuate its campers and counselors, even as floodwater reached the cabins, until counselors demanded it.”\n \n\n   \n  The “Camp chose not to evacuate the Bubble Inn and Twins cabins when other campers and counselors had been moved to safe, higher ground just 300 feet away,” the suit says. “Instead, the Camp chose to order its campers and counselors to remain in the Bubble Inn and Twins cabins while the flood waters overwhelmed the camp. Finally, when it was too late, the Camp made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster in which 25 campers, two counselors, and the Camp director died.”\n \n\n   \n  “We carry the memory of our daughter in everything we do. This legal step is one of honoring her, and we believe that truth and justice are essential to finding peace – not only for our family, but for every family affected,” said Ryan DeWitt, who lost his daughter, Molly.\n \n\n   \n  The second lawsuit, filed by the family of Eloise “Lulu” Peck, accused Camp Mystic of “gross negligence” by “failing to implement modern safety measures or update its own flood protocols in light of known dangers.”\n \n\n   \n  “These terrifying last moments and then deaths were proximately caused by the negligence and gross negligence of Defendants,” the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants knew that camp facilities were located in a flood zone, knew of the history of flash flooding in Kerr County, knew of repeated prior flood events at the Camp, and received warnings from family members about flood risk.”\n \n\n   \n  A third lawsuit was filed by the parents of Ellen, one of the youngest girls at the camp and who was housed at Bubble Inn cabin.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit alleges the camp’s directors and owners should have been aware of an emergency response activation in the area ahead of the major flooding and should have been on “high alert.”\n \n\n   \n  The defendants had enough time to evacuate all the campers and prevent injuries and death, the lawsuit alleges.\n \n\n   \n  “At the very least, Camp Mystic had more than enough time to train, educate, and instruct counselors and campers alike of a true evacuation plan should the weather continue to grow in severity through the day and into the night,” the lawsuit states. “However, the Defendants chose to do nothing after this alert to protect Ellen’s and the other campers’ lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, a plan to evacuate the campers came more than 12 hours after a flash flood warning, the lawsuit alleges. That plan was “wholly inadequate and purposefully left some of the youngest children in Bubble Inn completely stranded without instruction, direction, or adult emergency assistance before their tragic deaths,” according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  “The Camp’s failure to act led to utter chaos and mass panic,” the lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuits seek a jury trial in Travis County District Court. And they demand compensation for “mental anguish,” among other damages.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Camp Mystic attorney Mikal Watts for comment on the lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  In an  interview with CNN last month , Watts addressed some of the questions and concerns that had been raised by families.\n \n\n   \n  He said the first warning came at 1:14 a.m., but “there’s some question as to who got it and who didn’t, because this is a very remote area with limited cell phone coverage.”\n \n\n   \n  At 1:47 a.m., co-owner Dick Eastland and his son Edward “immediately convened the ground crew and started securing equipment, started coming up with a plan at about 2” a.m., Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  “At about 2:19, we got the first information that one of the houses was having water coming,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Before 3 a.m., “there was a very orderly evacuation process of 10 different camps or cabins,” Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  He also challenged the notion that evacuating children during flash flooding is always the best option.\n \n\n   \n  “You shelter in place. That’s first and foremost what you ought to do,” Watts said.\n \n\n   \n   “ Do not take 9-year-old girls who weigh 63 pounds on average into raging floodwaters. They’re going to get washed away.”\n \n\n   \n    Anger and grief lead to change\n \n\n   \n  The deaths at Camp Mystic have led to sharp questions from parents and lawmakers about the camp’s safety and evacuation plan in an area known to flood on a regular basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Obvious commonsense safety measures were absent. Protocols that should have been in place were ignored,” said CiCi Williams Steward, the mother of 8-year-old Cile, who remains missing. “She was stolen from her family, from her future, from the world she lit up with her independence and spunk.”\n \n\n   \n  In September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed  tougher camp safety laws  that require local governments to install outdoor sirens and warning systems in flood-prone areas.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the Camp Mystic attorney  offered an in-depth timeline  of how camp leaders responded to the flood warnings and rising waters. They safely evacuated 166 girls thanks to their quick efforts, Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  “This was an unprecedented, once-in-a-thousand-year event, that nobody thought was even possible,” he said. “It’s never happened before.”\n \n\n   \n   Camp Mystic has announced plans to partially reopen  this coming summer for its 100th anniversary. The section of the camp close to the Guadalupe River will remain closed. The more recent expansion, which sits uphill and was not damaged in the flooding, will reopen.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/new-delhi-explosion-red-fort-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:57:00-05:00","title":"Car Blast Kills at Least 10 People Near Historic Red Fort in India’s Delhi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A car explosion near the Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Delhi, India, killed at least 10 people and injured over 30 others.

against the company.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil has told Iraq’s state oil company SOMO that it is declaring force majeure – citing circumstances beyond its control for its inability to fulfill its contract – according to Oil Ministry spokesman Abdul Sahib Bazoun al-Hasnawi.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil has a 75% stake in the giant West Qurna-2 field in southern Iraq, which produces more than 400,000 barrels of crude oil a day. Overall, its overseas assets are valued at more than $20 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Hasnawi told CNN that Lukoil was unable to pay the salaries of hundreds of employees, most of them Iraqis, due to the  sanctions announced  by US President Donald Trump on October 22.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Lukoil for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil failed in its bid to sell its overseas operations to an Austrian-based company last week after the US Treasury intervened to block the move and its global assets are now at risk, according to industry analysts.\n \n\n   \n  Companies operating in Iraq “must be completely free from any operations, suspicions, or sanctions that may be issued … by the US Treasury or even the European Union,” according to Ali Nizar al-Shatari, director general of Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization known as SOMO.\n \n\n   \n  “All payments for exported oil and petroleum products are processed through the SWIFT (international transactions) system, which prohibits participation by sanctioned or high-risk entities,” al-Shatari said in a video statement last week.\n \n\n   \n  SOMO has suspended crude oil payments owed to Lukoil for the month of November – estimated at around four million barrels.\n \n\n   \n  “Lukoil’s dues remain frozen until a compliant payment mechanism is established,” al-Shatari said.\n \n\n   \n  Industry analysts say that several Lukoil shipments from Iraq were scheduled for this month.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil had tried to sell its overseas assets to Gunvor, a Swiss-based oil trader, but withdrew its bid after the US Treasury said it would “never” grant Gunvor a license to operate the assets.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil  said  on October 30 that it had accepted an offer from Gunvor to buy its subsidiary  Lukoil International GmbH, which owns the international assets of Lukoil Group.\n \n\n   \n  But last Thursday, the US Treasury said in a post on X that “as long as (Russian President Vladimir) Putin continues the senseless killings (in Russia’s  war on Ukraine ), the Kremlin’s puppet, Gunvor, will never get a license to operate and profit.”\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil International has a 5% stake in the Chevron-operated Tengiz oil development in Kazakhstan, as well as refineries in Romania and Bulgaria and a global trading operation controlled by a Swiss-based subsidiary.\n \n\n   \n  The Bulgarian authorities have tightened security around the Lukoil refinery in Burgas, according to state media, while the government drafts legislation that will allow it to take control of the refinery and sell it to a new owner to protect the plant from US sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  Last week the Finnish service station chain Teboil, also owned by Lukoil, was running out of fuel as sanctions against the parent company prevented it from doing business.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Finnish energy firm Neste suspended fuel deliveries to Teboil following the US measures against Lukoil.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/markets/warren-buffett-shareholder-letter","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:35:00-05:00","title":"Warren Buffett: ‘I’m going quiet’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Warren Buffett, the 95-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has announced he will step down at the end of 2025, ending his long-standing tradition of writing the annual shareholder letter.

But the 95-year-old is not going away just yet.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett will no longer write the message atop the company’s annual report, but he will continue to deliver an annual Thanksgiving message, and he will “step up” his philanthropy, giving away the $149 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock he continues to hold.\n \n\n   \n  “The Oracle of Omaha” has become an investing icon, a billionaire who has cultivated a folksy image, particularly through his letters to shareholders. Although his market moves are closely followed by investors around the world, Buffett has also worked to present himself as a cheerleader for America and ordinary Americans – and for capitalism.\n \n\n   \n  He is being replaced by Greg Abel next year. Abel, 63, is the vice chairman of non-insurance operations of Berkshire and was designated as Buffett’s successor in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett once again praised his successor, writing that he “has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire’s next CEO.”\n \n\n   \n  Buffett   also gave an update on his health, admitting that to his “surprise, I generally feel good. Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people.”\n \n\n   \n  But the nonagenarian isn’t getting any younger. Acknowledging the limited time he has left and the giant sum of money he wishes to give away, Buffett said he converted 1,800 shares, worth a combined $1.35 billion, into the company’s cheaper “B shares” and delivered them to four of his family’s foundations Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “To improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them, I need to step up the pace of lifetime gifts to their three foundations,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett says he has high – but realistic – expectations that the conglomerate he led for six decades will continue to thrive after he steps down as CEO. Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ) shares have risen more than 10% this year, with the company sitting on a $1 trillion market cap.\n \n\n   \n  “In aggregate, Berkshire’s businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems,” he wrote. “However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll.”\n \n\n   \n    The oracle and his ice cream\n \n\n   \n  Buffett has managed to become a symbol of two seemingly disparate things over his decades in the spotlight: a relentless dealmaker and capitalist, wrapped up in an avuncular figure dispensing practical advice.\n \n\n   \n  Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meetings are like those of no other company, dubbed Woodstock for capitalists, with an exhibit floor showing off many of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway’s businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Buffett himself makes a point to appear on the floor and hype up those companies, from eating Dairy Queen ice cream to putting his face and name on limited-edition event merch, all while his security keeps back hordes of shareholding fans trying to take pictures or get a word in with the so-called Oracle of Omaha.\n \n\n   \n  His investing strategy has turned on an incessant search for value, with Berkshire Hathaway often sitting on giant piles of cash until just the right deal comes through. Few other CEOs have earned that level of patience from investors in a market that more often turns on expectations for short-term returns.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett expects the company to move on from him. But so much of Berkshire’s identity has become intertwined with its CEO. It’s hard to imagine the low-profile Greg Abel, for example, putting  his face on a ketchup bottle  to spur sales. Woodstock for capitalists might get just a little less festive from now on.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/dhs-ice-immigrants-chicago-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:58:00-05:00","title":"DHS says agents were shot at amid chaotic day of immigration enforcement operations in Chicago area","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a federal immigration enforcement operation in Chicago on Saturday, November 8, 2025, Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at by a man driving a black Jeep in the Little Village neighborhood.

  \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago Saturday, the agency said — as federal agents were also accused of using pepper spray and flash-bang grenades against protesters across the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The incidents come as Chicago has emerged as the center of tense standoffs between federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations and frustrated and  angry community members  protesting the Trump administration’s wide-ranging deportation campaign. A federal judge  issued a ruling Friday  limiting federal agents’ use of force in Chicago, after they repeatedly used tear gas and other forms of force against protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting took place in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood Saturday morning,  according to DHS . A male driving a “black Jeep” opened fire at Border Patrol agents, then fled the scene, said the agency. A suspect from Mexico was arrested in connection with the shooting, DHS said  in a post on X  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has framed the incidents as part of a series of attacks they say  target federal agents . “The violence in Chicago against law enforcement is unprecedented,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement shared with CNN. “These attacks are the consequence of vitriolic smears from sanctuary politicians and the media.”\n \n\n   \n  But immigrant advocates, local politicians, and legal groups said it is  federal agents  who are driving violence and chaos against angry but peaceful protesters and bystanders.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday was a day of terror,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, who says he witnessed flash grenades detonated in the street. “It follows an agenda of terror by this president.”\n \n\n   \n  Several DHS statements about its immigration crackdown in Chicago — “Operation Midway Blitz” — have  later been contradicted  by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing, fueling mounting skepticism of the agency’s claims. In Friday’s ruling, a federal judge said  Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino  “admitted that he lied” when he claimed he threw tear gas at protesters after a rock was thrown near his head, and said video disproved his account.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s evidence was “simply not credible” and its portrayal of Chicago “untrue,”  US District Judge Sara Ellis  said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Sunday  appealing  Ellis’  order  limiting the use of force by federal agents involved in the Chicago immigration crackdown. The court document did not include the grounds for appeal.\n \n\n   \n  It is not immediately clear when the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the case.\n \n\n   \n  The National Lawyers Guild Chicago said nine people in all were arrested and taken into federal custody Saturday. DHS says Border Patrol arrested eight US citizens and one “illegal alien.”\n \n\n   \n    Agents shot at by driver, DHS says\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents were “accosted by a hostile crowd” while conducting an immigration enforcement operation around 9:30 a.m. Saturday near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue,  DHS said . The crowd “boxed them into a street and alleyway,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  “As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds,” reads DHS’ statement. “He immediately fled the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  There were no reports of anyone struck by gunfire, according to the Chicago Police Department, which responded to help secure the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino didn’t name the suspect in an interview on Fox News Monday but described him as an “illegal alien” with a previous firearms conviction. CNN has reached out to DHS for more information. The FBI told CNN it does not comment on “potential investigative matters.”\n \n\n   \n  After the incident, “an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicles,” according to DHS. The agency said no Border Patrol agents were injured in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a Monday news conference he had heard about the shooting. He said Bovino and federal agents “have absolutely no credibility because of the repeated lies, both to the courts and to the public, so we have no way to verify the reports,” but that federal authorities were investigating.\n \n\n   \n  “While I do not welcome federal agents operating in this capacity, I unequivocally condemn violence directed at them,” the mayor said  in a post on X. \n \n\n   \n  After leaving the scene of the shooting, Border Patrol agents “encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy” and   deployed a “Controlled Tire Deflation Device,” DHS said. Another driver was arrested after attempting to ram the convoy as agents proceeded toward an FBI facility, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n    Flash bangs deployed in Little Village\n \n\n   \n  Then the Border Patrol agents “encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski,” according to DHS. The agency said the “rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects” and agents used “crowd control measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Matt DeMateo, a pastor at New Life Community Church, said he was driving at the intersection of 26th Avenue and Pulaski Road when he saw federal agents exit their vehicles, “guns drawn.” He says he didn’t hear “any warning” before flash-bang grenades were deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Videos from the scene taken around 11:10 a.m. show what appear to be agents in tactical gear exiting their vehicles in the street. Another video shows people standing around a white vehicle, some seemingly filming with their phones.\n \n\n   \n  A passenger in the white vehicle is seen in the video tossing an object out of the window. A loud bang sounds and smoke explodes, scattering bystanders as the vehicle starts to drive away. One person is seen in the video throwing something at the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n   Whistles  — a signal community members have used to alert others to the presence of federal immigration agents — ring out. “Get the f**k out of here,” one person was heard yelling.\n \n\n   \n  Alderman Rodriguez said he was attending his son’s chess competition nearby but stepped outside to join “rapid responders.”\n \n\n   \n  “People were vociferously protesting,” he said. But the federal vehicles “had a clear path to move out,” he said, and echoed DeMateo’s statement that he didn’t hear any warnings before the flash-bang grenades were detonated. He said he didn’t see any objects thrown at agents before the flash-bangs.\n \n\n   \n  One flash grenade exploded just a foot away from him, said   the alderman, who represents Chicago’s 22nd ward, sending him ducking for cover.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we stand here today, sick and tired of what’s happening here, not just in our country and not just in our city, but in our neighborhood and on our streets,” he said. “We want peace. We want tranquility.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino was spotted at 26th and Pulaski by DeMateo, the pastor, in the Little Village neighborhood where DHS and the Border Patrol chief originally claimed  he was hit in the head  with a rock by a protester.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw right next to my van, Bovino pull the pin on another grenade, threatening to throw it,” said DeMateo. The Border Patrol chief had an interaction with “neighbors” and then got into his vehicle, DeMateo said.\n \n\n   \n  It was just days after Ellis said Bovino had lied about being hit before using tear gas and ordering restrictions on federal agents’ use of force.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene appears to show Bovino holding a shiny object and yelling “back up” after a flash bang went off. He then approaches a vehicle. Bovino isn’t seen throwing the object or deploying tear gas in any videos obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has not responded to CNN’s repeated questions about Bovino’s presence in Little Village and his role on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n    Community outrage\n \n\n   \n  At Sunday’s news conference, local politicians and activists expressed their anger and frustration at federal agents’ actions Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago’s mayor said Monday ICE raids “are meant to be provocative.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are trying to incite chaos,” Johnson said. “And they are putting our police officers right in the middle of it to clean up the mess that they are creating.”\n \n\n   \n  Victor Rodriguez, who described himself as a lifelong community resident, said he was struck by both the “anger” and the “great lament” of his neighbors Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have people here running home, mothers and fathers scared to leave their house,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, who represents Illinois’ 4th Congressional district, decried the “unconstitutional, illegal and barbaric acts of federal agents who continue to inflict violence on our community.”\n \n\n   \n  He lauded the “nonviolent resistance” that Chicago protesters have engaged in and called the city “the forefront of a fight for new civility and civil rights in America.”\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Celina Villanueva characterized Saturday’s operations as “state-sponsored terrorism” and praised community efforts to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have tear gas, we don’t have pepper spray,” she said. “We literally have our bodies and whistles, and we’re fighting back with that because it’s about humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, DHS blamed liberal politicians, saying they “fueled an environment of lawlessness and assault on federal law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  “Make no mistake: Our mission will continue despite the violence,” said Assistant Secretary McLaughlin in the agency’s statement. “And if you lay a hand on law enforcement, you will face the consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:35:00-05:00","title":"Canada loses its measles elimination status amid large outbreak","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status due to sustained transmission of the same measles virus strain since October 2024, with over 5,000 cases reported in the past year.

\n  By Nadia Kounang, Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:35 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Canada has lost its measles elimination status amid a large ongoing outbreak of the virus, the Public Health Agency of Canada said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Canada’s health agency was informed by the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, that it had lost its measles elimination status as viral transmission has continued uninterrupted since October 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Although it has slowed recently, according to the Canadian government, the outbreak is still ongoing, primarily within undervaccinated communities.\n \n\n   \n  “PAHO’s Measles and Rubella Elimination Regional Monitoring and Re-Verification Commission reviewed recent epidemiological and laboratory data, confirming sustained transmission of the same measles virus strain in Canada for a period of more than one year,” officials said in a statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n \n\n   \n  The Re-Verification Commission, or RVC, is an independent body of experts created by the Pan American Health Organization to analyze data and the current measles outbreak situation. The group met at the beginning of November and made its recommendations to the PAHO director, who makes the ultimate decision about Canada’s status.\n \n\n   \n  Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the virus strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months, the Public Health Agency of Canada  said on its website.  The agency said it is working with PAHO and local public health leaders to slow the outbreak.\n \n\n   \n  Canada  had been considered measles-free since 1998.  A measles vaccine was first approved to be used in Canada in 1963, and various vaccination campaigns were successful. But in more recent years, vaccine hesitancy has grown, and vaccination rates fell below the target of 95% coverage for all recommended childhood vaccines,  research shows .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to say that all the other 34 countries in the region, they keep their certification as measles-free,” PAHO Director Dr. Jarbas Barbosa said Monday. “This loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible.”\n \n\n   \n  However, with the change in Canada’s status, the Americas region officially loses its measles-free status.\n \n\n   \n  There are no formal consequences to losing such status. But until measles is eliminated worldwide, countries will face the risk of reintroduction and the spread of the virus, Barbosa said. The virus is so contagious that one infected person can transmit the disease to up to 18 others.\n \n\n   \n  As of last month, Canada had tallied more than 5,000 cases for the year — more than twice as many as the country has recorded in the past 25 years combined.\n \n\n   \n  The US has also seen large outbreaks this year and is on the verge of losing its elimination status.\n \n\n   \n  “We are hoping that the US is going to stop the transmission even before that deadline,” said Dr. Daniel Salas, executive manager of PAHO’s Special Program for Comprehensive Immunization.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s large US measles outbreak started in West Texas in January. It’s been declared over, but there is an investigation into whether a growing outbreak along the Arizona-Utah state line could be connected. Cases and outbreaks have also been reported in other states.\n \n\n   \n  “We are supporting all the actions that the US has been taking to actually control the outbreak to stop them,” Salas said.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico also has a recent outbreak, Salas said, concentrated mostly in Chihuahua, but there are also cases in Mexico’s southern states.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely, they need to continue vaccinating,” Salas said.\n \n\n   \n  With hard work, Barbosa said, he believes that Canada can regain its measles-free status.\n \n\n   \n  “As we have demonstrated before with political commitment regional cooperation and sustain the vaccination, the region can once again interrupt the transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/football-nfl-new-york-giants-fire-brian-daboll","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:05:00Z","title":"New York Giants fire head coach Brian Daboll","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The New York Giants have fired head coach Brian Daboll after a 2-8 start in the 2025 NFL season, following a 24-20 loss to the Chicago Bears.

Jacqueline Howard, Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a pivotal move, the US Food and Drug Administration said Monday that  it is taking steps to remove the lengthy “black box” warning  on many hormone treatments for women with menopause symptoms, a shift expected to give women more options for treatment and generate a flood of new prescriptions.\n \n\n   \n  Hormone therapy has long been on the market, but prescriptions plummeted after 2003, when the warning described increased risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, breast cancer and dementia.\n \n\n   \n  “After 23 years of dogma, the FDA today is announcing that we are going to stop the fear machine steering women away from this life-changing, even life-saving, treatment,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in announcing the change.\n \n\n   \n  Prescribing requires nuance, FDA officials said, especially around when women start hormone therapy. Some women still face some risks from hormone therapy, including those at increased risk of blood clots or who have previously had breast cancer.\n \n\n   \n  But for many women, the benefits may far outweigh the risks.\n \n\n   \n  “With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there’s no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,” Makary  posted on X  Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  It could take months for the labels to change, but drugmakers are “very excited” to make the update, Makary said.  Label changes  will include updated guidance that hormones should be initiated in women who are younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause to optimize benefits and risks, and removal of guidance to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time — clearing the way for women to stay on the treatments for years.\n \n\n   \n  “We want people to talk to their doctors, and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications,” Makary said.\n \n\n   \n  Women’s health experts praised the move to update the boxed warning to reflect newer scientific evidence around menopausal hormone therapy but said individualized discussions of risks and benefits will still be needed.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a past president of the Menopause Society, said the labeling change was overdue.\n \n\n   \n  “As a bottom line, I think given more than 20 years of class-wide labeling of hormone therapy, it is time to get the labeling right, and some of these changes that are proposed are very well-supported. Others may be controversial, but overall, it is a step in the right direction,” said Manson, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study that spurred the initial label change.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, this box warning is a one-size-fits-all summary that hormone therapy increases the risk of all these conditions,” Manson said. “It doesn’t take into account whether it’s local estrogen or systemic estrogen, the age of the woman, the type of the formulation.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, said she is among many doctors who advocated for label changes for years.\n \n\n   \n  “Removing the scary boxed warning from local vaginal estrogen is a victory for women’s health and for those who care for and about menopausal women,” Pinkerton said in a statement. “Regarding the removal of the boxed warning for systemic hormone therapy, which is absorbed into the bloodstream and has systemic effects throughout the body, we appreciate the FDA’s thoughtful, nuanced approach. Discussions will be more complicated and need to be individualized, as different menopause therapies differ in potential risks.”\n \n\n   \n    What changed around hormone therapy\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning is the strongest type of alert the FDA puts on a drug label. Since 2003, labels of  menopause treatments  that contain estrogen – including pills, patches, sprays and creams – have warned that their use can increase the risk of uterine and breast cancers, as well as strokes and blood clots. The labels also warned about an increased risk of dementia for women over the age of 65.\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning, or boxed warning, was added after  a large government-funded study , the Women’s Health Initiative, found in 2002 that women taking estrogen pills after menopause had some higher health risks compared with women who took a placebo. The study participants had an average age of 63, so many were past menopause when they started the therapy.\n \n\n   \n  After the study and the label change, doctors became reluctant to prescribe them, and prescriptions for hormone therapy for menopause dropped by more than 70%. In the late 1990s, more than 1 in 4 postmenopausal women were taking hormones to manage symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and night sweats. By 2020, that number had dropped to about 1 in 25,  one study found .\n \n\n   \n  The result has been undertreatment of symptoms that can be debilitating for women in midlife.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been a total horrible tragedy that so many millions of women have been deprived,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, a New York-based internist and author of the books “ Don’t Let Your Doctor Kill You ” and “ The New Hormone Solution .”\n \n\n   \n  “Hormone therapy is important because for about 10 to 15 years before you go into menopause, your hormones start leaving you. As your hormones start leaving you, you need more hormones. And you don’t need hormone replacement; you need hormone supplementation,” Schwartz said.\n \n\n   \n  “Chronic illnesses like heart disease, Alzheimer’s, osteoporosis, cancer, they are diseases of aging, and one reason is the loss of hormones.”\n \n\n   \n  More recent analyses of the Women’s Health Initiative,  as early as 2010 , have since shown that hormone therapy started in women younger than 60, or within 10 years of starting menopause, can more safely help manage menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and poor sleep as long as the women don’t have specific contraindications such as a history of hormone-sensitive breast or uterine cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “To this day, I still have patients coming in telling me their obstetricians or gynecologists have said to them they shouldn’t be taking hormones, because they’re going to get cancer. And not only will they not get cancer, the hormones will protect them from cancer,” Schwartz said. “We have the data.”\n \n\n   \n  In July, the FDA convened a panel of experts to discuss the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for women. The panelists urged the agency to remove the warning label.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Makary  told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta  in an episode of the “Chasing Life” podcast that the agency was in “serious discussions” about what to do with the black box warning.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really a tragedy. It’s maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine,” Makary said. “It’s resulted in 50 million women being denied this incredible therapy.”\n \n\n   \n    Changing views on menopause\n \n\n   \n  The FDA action follows a wave of policies introduced across the country to improve menopause care at the state level. Most of the legislation has been related to insurance   coverage for menopause care, awareness and education, clinician training or menopause in the workplace.\n \n\n   \n  “When we think about the timing of this announcement, it’s not just the FDA making a move. It comes in the good company of now 19 states, red and blue alike, introducing more than 35 bills to improve menopause care,” said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, executive director of the Birnbaum Women’s Leadership Center at the  New York University School of Law , who has been tracking menopause legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “All these things are happening at the same time, and that’s in part because there is a loud and proud movement making these demands now, insisting that menopause care be equitable and treatments accessible, that menopause no longer be in the shadows and that we not be subject to misinformation,” said Weiss-Wolf, author of the forthcoming book, “When In Menopause: A User’s Manual and Citizens Guide.”\n \n\n   \n  The removal of the warning on hormone for menopause has long been in the making, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  “Back in 2014, the Menopause Society and other leading menopause experts had actually started  a petition to the FDA  to remove the label,” Weiss-Wolf said. “This is something that the menopause medical community has been asking for.”\n \n\n   \n  The action will change the landscape of care to make hormone therapy, especially estrogen, more accessible for midlife women, said Dr. Jayne Morgan, an Atlanta-based cardiologist and vice president of medical affairs at Hello Heart, an app that specializes in women’s health and cardiovascular research.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact of the matter is, estrogen is one of the primary drivers of the heart. There are estrogen receptors on the heart, on the brain, in the bones, so it’s like the fuel that drives our body. Once that fuel runs out, it’s just like a car, the car begins to sputter,” Morgan said.\n \n\n   \n  “Women live about  six years longer  than men, but we spend about 25% of our lives in lower quality of life,” she said. “That’s where hormone therapy can help.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/media/bbc-trump-edit-lawsuit-turness-davie-media","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"Trump threatens to sue BBC as broadcaster faces ‘fight for its survival’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A one-year-old BBC documentary about Donald Trump’s reelection campaign was found to have misleadingly edited a segment of his January 6 speech, giving the false impression he had called for violent action.

Trump threatens to sue BBC as broadcaster faces ‘fight for its survival’ \n       \n  By Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:04 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The BBC is embroiled in a massive political fight over its future, with conservatives capitalizing on  an editing screw-up  and denouncing the British broadcaster while liberals argue that the institution is flawed but worth defending.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Trump intensified the pressure by sending a threatening legal letter to the news organization over the misleading edit in a one-year-old documentary about his reelection campaign. He is demanding at least $1 billion in damages.\n \n\n   \n  A BBC spokesperson told CNN that “we will review the letter and respond directly in due course.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has sent several legal letters to other news organizations, including CNN, during his second term in office.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s legal threats often don’t amount to anything, but he does have pending lawsuits against the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the Des Moines Register.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah issued a belated apology for the “error of judgment” with the October 2024 documentary. BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness tendered their resignations on Sunday as stories about the edit scandal consumed British media.\n \n\n   \n  There is no indication that the misleading edit was politically motivated. Nor is there any reason to believe that Davie and Turness knew about it ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  However, a lawyer for Trump asserted Monday that the BBC defamed the president “by intentionally and deceitfully editing its documentary in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election.”\n \n\n   \n  The letter, obtained by CNN, charges the broadcaster with defamation and claims that Trump has suffered “overwhelming financial and reputational harm,” despite no one seeming to call out the error at the time of the broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, The Telegraph, a longtime source of anti-BBC commentary, wrote about an “internal report” revealing the bad edit, and the story has since snowballed.\n \n\n   \n  The pre-election film spliced together different parts of Trump’s infamous January 6 speech at the Ellipse to make it sound like Trump told the crowd he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tone was certainly combative that day, but in the actual speech, his exhortations to “fight” were separate from his suggestion about walking to the Capitol to “cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  In a contrite letter to the head of a parliamentary committee on Monday, Shah said the BBC accepted that “the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘We are not perfect’\n \n\n   \n  The revelation about the misleading edit has contributed to an ongoing political fight over the BBC’s funding and future, with conservatives using the error as a new opportunity to denounce the British broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  “The BBC is facing a coordinated, politically motivated attack,” BBC veteran John Simpson wrote on X Sunday night. He praised Davie and Turness and said, “We’ve now got a real fight on our hands to defend public service broadcasting, because that’s under threat too.”\n \n\n   \n  This is ultimately all about trust: Who trusts the BBC, who doesn’t, and why.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s adversaries, including politicians who detest its news coverage and media moguls who want to take its market share, say the BBC has lost trust, perhaps permanently.\n \n\n   \n  They cite a wide range of perceived wrongs. Former conservative party leader Liz Truss, who had a brief term as prime minister in 2022, wrote on Sunday, “I’m glad the US President and the rest of the world are seeing the BBC for what it is. failure to tell the truth on everything from transgender ideology to economics to Gaza has done huge damage to politics and government in this country. This should be the end of nationalised broadcasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Conservative activists in the UK have long railed against the license fee that British households pay for BBC programs and services. The government is currently reviewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, including the license fee structure, ahead of the current charter’s expiration at the end of 2027.\n \n\n   \n  That review presents an opening for the BBC’s many critics to demand changes — at the same time, the BBC is trying to establish new revenue streams and transform itself for the digital age.\n \n\n   \n  Last week’s story in The Telegraph was based on a lengthy memo by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on editorial standards and guidelines. Prescott’s memo warned the BBC board about what he called serious problems with news coverage and “inaction” by the broadcaster’s leadership.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump documentary was his first example, but he also cited concerns about coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, gender identity, racial diversity and other matters. He argued that “errors are repeated time and time again.”\n \n\n   \n  Shah responded on Monday and said the BBC has “published corrections where we have got things wrong; changed editorial guidance to make the BBC’s position on issues clearer; made changes to leadership where the problems point to underlying issues; and carried out formal disciplinary measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Shah also urged people to keep “a sense of perspective,” pointing to “thousands of hours of outstanding journalism” by the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  But a sense of perspective is usually the first thing lost in a media feeding frenzy. Veteran British journalist Alan Rusbridger wrote Monday that the BBC now finds itself “in a fight for its survival.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump documentary error was “serious,” Rusbridger wrote, but the BBC’s enemies want to see the entire organization “wither or die,” which “would leave us all far worse off.”\n \n\n   \n  Robert Shrimsley, UK chief political commentator and executive editor of the Financial Times, said on X that it’s important to recognize the political dimensions of the dispute.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that the BBC has made serious culpable errors does not negate the point that there is a real and concerted right-wing media campaign to destroy it,” Shrimsley said. “Both points can be true at the same time and the campaign would not end even if the errors did.”\n \n\n   \n  After reading all the press about the scandal from Kyiv, where he is on assignment, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale took to social media and expressed his pride in the organization.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not perfect; we must always strive to be better,” he wrote Monday. “But in a darkening world, we remain a shaft of light.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/weather/arctic-blast-chicago-snow-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:51:00-05:00","title":"Over a foot of snow piles up in the Great Lakes as Arctic blast spreads across much of the US","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An intense Arctic cold snap swept across much of the United States in early November 2025, bringing record-breaking cold temperatures to the southeastern U.S. and heavy lake-effect snow to the Great Lakes region.

as Arctic blast spreads across much of the US \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologists Briana Waxman, Chris Dolce\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:51 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Intense lake-effect snow is creating dangerous travel conditions   in the Great Lakes   and it’s all   being fueled by a record cold snap sending the eastern half of the United States into a brief bout of winter.\n \n\n   \n  The snow developed overnight in Chicagoland along with thunder and strong winds. Forecasts for the city on Sunday called for potential historic November snow totals over 10 inches, but the heaviest bands of snow have spared the downtown area from those kinds of totals Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Lake-effect snow totals  often swing wildly from location to location  depending on where heavier bands develop because of how narrow they are.\n \n\n   \n  That’s what’s happened Monday near Lake Michigan. Up to a foot of snow has fallen more than 50 miles south of Chicago, and totals north of the city from far northeast Illinois into southeast Wisconsin have topped 10 inches. Dangerous travel conditions from snow and strong winds were reported early Monday along Interstate 57 south of Chicago in Kankakee and northern Iroquois counties in Illinois, the  National Weather Service said. \n \n\n   \n  The snow threat stretches beyond Chicago across the Great Lakes. It’s being spawned by a rush of Arctic air that’s unusually cold for November pushing south and east and threatening dozens of low temperature records as far south as Florida over the next couple of days.\n \n\n   \n  Over a foot of snow has fallen in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and northwest Indiana, with more accumulation expected through Monday. Several inches of snow will pile up in the eastern Great Lakes through Tuesday, particularly in the snow belts of northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and southwest New York.\n \n\n   \n    Record-setting cold to start the week\n \n\n   \n  This brutal winter-like setup in the Midwest is being driven by the same Arctic air mass that’s crashing across the eastern two-thirds of the country. This isn’t just a “cold front.” This is a full-scale polar plunge.\n \n\n   \n  Some southeastern cities could face some of their coldest early-November temperatures in decades on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  Daily record lows will be threatened parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, the Carolinas, southeast Louisiana and even Florida. That includes places like Birmingham and Huntsville in Alabama, Baton Rouge in Louisiana, Savannah in Georgia and Tampa and Fort Myers in Florida.\n \n\n   \n  Jacksonville, Florida, is predicted to hit 30 degrees Tuesday morning, marking the earliest it’s been that cold in fall since 1976. That would also be the case in Savannah, Georgia, if the low drops to 28 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday daytime highs in Florida could be some of the coldest on record for the date. Melbourne, Florida, could see its earliest day below 60 degrees since records began there more than 85 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Cold weather advisories for wind chills in the 20s or lower 30s have been issued in Florida for Monday night into Tuesday morning as far south as Naples. Freeze warnings cover parts of several other states in the Southeast.\n \n\n   \n  Washington, DC, and New York City are also likely to log their coldest morning of the stretch on Tuesday. DC could wake up near 30 degrees﻿ with New York City near freezing. Morning wind chills in both cities could sit in the lower to mid-20s.\n \n\n   \n  There will be snow in other regions as well. Lake-effect snow continues downwind of the Great Lakes. The west slopes of the central Appalachians could pick up several inches Monday. Higher elevations from West Virginia through the border of North Carolina and Tennessee can expect accumulating snow. A few flakes were even falling as far south as Atlanta on Monday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The good news: The cold snap won’t stick around long. Temperatures across the central US rebound quickly on Tuesday, and most of the East warms up again on Wednesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/pregnancy-gun-homicide-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:26:00Z","title":"Women face a much higher risk of homicide, especially from guns, during pregnancy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pregnant women in the United States face a significantly higher risk of homicide, especially from firearms, with research showing a 37% higher firearm homicide rate compared to non-pregnant women.

daily call to a prayer line, she went to work and got another call: from the police department in Richmond, Virginia. Her youngest daughter, Francesca Harris-Scarborough, had been killed the night before.\n \n\n   \n  Police had found the 31-year-old’s car still idling. Scarborough’s daughter, who was three months pregnant, had been shot twice in the heart.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t ready for it. I lost control of everything,” Scarborough said. “Everything went blank.”\n \n\n   \n  Francesca was part of a terrible trend in the United States: Homicide is the No. 1 way pregnant women die,  research  has  showed , but a new  study  finds that they are even more vulnerable than other women of childbearing age when there’s a gun involved.\n \n\n   \n  The study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open, looked at more than 7,000 homicides of women of childbearing age between 2018 and 2021. Pregnant women were found to have a 37% higher firearm homicide rate than women who weren’t pregnant, and more than two-thirds of pregnancy-associated homicides involved firearms.\n \n\n   \n  The presence of a firearm is known to be a key risk factor of intimate partner homicide. The new study showed that every 1% increase in state-level firearm ownership was associated with a 6% increase in all-cause homicide and an 8% increase in the firearm-specific homicide rate in pregnant women, even after adjusting for other factors.\n \n\n   \n  “Even incremental increases in firearm availability may contribute to measurable increases in homicide risk in pregnant women,” the researchers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really not surprising, if you think about it, that if firearms are more available, then that certainly it does increase your risk of homicide in general,” said study co-author Dr. Lois Lee, a senior faculty adviser in the Office and Health Equity & Inclusion and an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. “So you could imagine, if you take away or at least decrease the number of firearms, then there would likely be many fewer deaths during pregnancy.”\n \n\n   \n  “And unlike medical conditions, which, yes, we do have many medical advances and can save many lives, but in some ways, those conditions are much less preventable, like eclampsia and sepsis,” Lee added. “This is predictable and potentially preventable.”\n \n\n   \n  The highest proportion of homicides in pregnant women was among those 20 to 24 years old. Among women who weren’t pregnant, it was ages 25 to 29. Most homicide victims were Black, whether they were pregnant or not.\n \n\n   \n  “Those findings suggest that these risks of homicide during pregnancy are shaped not just by individual factors but by broader systems of inequity and structural racism,” Lee said. “So it’s not just a solution at the individual level that’s needed, but there needs to be urgent change at a policy level, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The study authors recommend safe storage laws and domestic violence firearm prohibitions.\n \n\n   \n  Although most states prohibit people with final protective orders from purchasing or possessing firearms, such laws should be expanded to require people to surrender their firearms even when there’s an emergency protective order on the books, said Dr. Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, who was not involved with the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “Usually, the first stage of that order process is often the most dangerous time for individuals experiencing intimate partner or family violence, since it is usually the first indication that an individual is going to be separating from an abuser,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Roskam said the most successful gun surrender laws also have strong follow-up. She points to a program in King County, Washington, that created  a multidisciplinary team  of prosecutors, law enforcement and court administrators who serve on a regional domestic violence firearm unit. It scours court documents and databases to make sure every individual involved in a domestic violence offense gives up every firearm.\n \n\n   \n  According to  King County , firearms are used in domestic violence homicides more than all other weapons combined in Washington state.\n \n\n   \n  “They really show respondents that they are very serious about ensuring this firearm relinquishment compliance. And since they have started doing this, they have been recovering a much larger number of firearms from these protective orders,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Scarborough has been working on her own programs so more women are spared her daughter’s fate. She created a nonprofit called  Cry Loud, Spare Not, Speak Up  that’s dedicated to empowering women affected by domestic violence and abuse in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  In reading her daughter’s journals after her death, Scarborough said, she realized that although her daughter was successful and seemed happy, she had confidence issues that began when she was younger. Scarborough also started a program for girls  ages 12 and up  to cultivate self-esteem and grow their confidence.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, near the anniversary of Francesca’s death, Scarborough hosts another empowerment program for girls and women called “I Am Enough, I Know My Worth.”\n \n\n   \n  “This way she will never die. We can always try to help somebody,” Scarborough said. “Her death has really been my teacher. It’s changed my life.

       1:48 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The longest shutdown in American history appears headed for a conclusion, after  eight moderate-leaning members  of the Senate Democratic Caucus broke ranks to  cut a deal with Republicans  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n   Much has yet to play out  and votes still need to be held. But it looks as though enough Democrats have given up on demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare tax credits and have accepted much more modest concessions.\n \n\n   \n  So how did this happen? What did we learn? And where do we go from here?\n \n\n   \n  Here are some takeaways from the politics of it.\n \n\n   \n    1. Democrats caved, full stop\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic Party isn’t leaving this process with nothing. They got a couple of significant concessions.\n \n\n   \n  One is a commitment to hold a Senate vote on extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies by next month — a vote that could apply real political pressure on Republicans. Democrats also got Republicans to agree to undo President Donald Trump’s attempts to lay off thousands of federal workers and to block any other such efforts through January.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s no question Democrats are the ones who folded, and somewhat curiously so.\n \n\n   \n  Virtually every poll showed them winning the blame game. They were fighting for something — an extension of the subsides — that those polls showed more than 7 in 10 Americans wanted. About  half of Americans wanted Democrats  to hold the line — something we just haven’t seen in recent shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats could seemingly have drawn this out and forced the issue. But they didn’t.\n \n\n   \n  “The question was, is, as the shutdown progresses, is a solution on [the Obamacare tax credits] becoming any more likely?” said Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and who voted to advance the deal. “It appears not.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s certainly disputable. What’s not disputable is that a handful of more moderate Democrats lost their nerve.\n \n\n   \n    2. Democrats face a new reckoning — at a really bad time\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps King and Democrats like Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire  who threw in the towel  were right. Perhaps Democrats never would have won their main concession, and the shutdown would’ve gotten much uglier for the country in the days and weeks ahead — and unnecessarily so.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps worsening travel delays and Americans going hungry amid the legal fight over food stamps would ultimately have cost Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  We’ll likely never know.\n \n\n   \n  But what’s clear is that this cave came at a bad time for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  It was finally looking like the party had some unity, purpose and wind at their backs after a year of being riven and lost in the wilderness. Some polling suggested Democratic voters, whose dim views of their party rendered it more unpopular than it’s been in decades, were  warming to their party’s brand again . The election results last week, following millions of people turning out to protest Trump at  “No Kings” demonstrations  last month, were especially encouraging for the party.\n \n\n   \n  But now Democrats will endure recriminations over whether the party truly has the stomach to fight Trumpism. The lawmakers who’ve advanced this deal appear to be in for some real vitriol from the base, and it’s likely to renew efforts to cast aside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in some ways seem to be in a similar position to where the GOP was last decade, when a large portion of the party wanted to fight harder, but the more moderate and institutional ranks ultimately stood in the way of a bolder approach.\n \n\n   \n  None of which means this will sink Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections. History suggests this shutdown will be a distant memory by then. Anybody who cares that much about the shutdown is probably a nailed-on Democratic voter anyway. And this issue could eventually redound to their benefit (for reasons we’ll get to).\n \n\n   \n  But it does complicate things internally right now.\n \n\n   \n    3. Trump’s hostage-taking worked\n \n\n   \n  One of the more frustrating aspects for the Democratic base will be how this ended.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t just that Democrats decided to give in; it’s that they did so in a way that appeared to reward Trump for heavy-handed tactics — again.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has in recent days ratcheted up the pressure points. It has fought in court to  avoid paying full SNAP benefits . And it has  reduced traffic at dozens of major airports , leading to  hundreds of canceled flights . (The administration said this move was about safety, but critics wagered it was  more about leverage .) Trump has also pushed the GOP to scrap the filibuster in ways that didn’t seem likely to go anywhere but might have concerned more institutionally minded Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  All of this comes after Trump explicitly targeted what he called “Democrat programs” with layoffs and funding cuts.\n \n\n   \n  This is a familiar tale by now. Trump has proved plenty willing to reach for all available leverage at his disposal, often violating political norms and possibly even the law in the process.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s worked for him. Institutions including colleges, law firms and media companies have repeatedly folded rather than fight Trump on these things, even when it appeared they had the upper hand. And that surely emboldens him.\n \n\n   \n  “Standing up to Donald Trump didn’t work,” King said Monday morning on MSNBC, “it actually gave him more power.”\n \n\n   \n  Expect plenty of Democrats to pull their hair out over that quote.\n \n\n   \n    4. Trump’s hubris was on full display\n \n\n   \n  The flip side of Trump’s approach, though, was that it betrayed some remarkable hubris.\n \n\n   \n  Just consider all that happened over the last six weeks — and how little care he took to mind the optics.\n \n\n   \n  The administration repeatedly fought to avoid paying full SNAP benefits. That provided lawmaking leverage, yes, but it also risked making it look like it  wanted  to use poor people and their hunger as leverage. The president attended  a “Great Gatsby”-themed party  at his Mar-a-Lago resort the night before Americans were due to start losing those SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump bulldozed the East Wing of the White House to build a $350 million ballroom that polls show the American people  are pretty skeptical of .\n \n\n   \n  He extensively promoted a  very marbled renovation  of the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s efforts to gild the White House seemed to  continue apace .\n \n\n   \n  These are all pretty questionable moves, given not just the shutdown but also a series of troubling economic signs. But Trump, who’s taken to talking about  “affordability”  of late, seems unperturbed by how it might look.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, his approval rating has  plumbed new depths   over the past two weeks .\n \n\n   \n    5. Republicans still have an Obamacare problem — and this could exacerbate it\n \n\n   \n  The best case for Democrats’ strategy is this: They were never going to get Trump and GOP leaders to commit to extending the Obamacare tax credits as part of a shutdown deal. But they could force an issue that’s a significant GOP liability, cast a spotlight on it and even force Republicans to take some tough votes and squirm a little.\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of whether that was actually the best Democrats could do, the pressure being applied on the GOP on health care isn’t insignificant.\n \n\n   \n  With around three-quarters of Americans supporting the tax credits, this issue poses very real political problems for Republicans. A recent Pew Research Center poll also showed  health care was the GOP’s worst issue  among a dozen tested, with 42% favoring the Democratic Party’s approach, compared with just 29% for Republicans’.\n \n\n   \n  Look at none other than  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia pleading with her party to renew these tax credits. Or the July  memo authored by Trump’s own pollster , Tony Fabrizio, making the case that letting the subsidies lapse could spell political disaster for the GOP in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  If nothing else, this record-long shutdown could spotlight the choice Republicans are about to make. By voting for a deal that does not extend the subsidies and therefore allows premiums to skyrocket for millions of Americans, Republicans will have made it clearer that this is what they fought hard for. They’ll be put on the record on the issue in an even starker way when the Senate takes a separate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  If that measure were somehow to pass, it could pressure Speaker Mike Johnson to allow a vote in the House too.\n \n\n   \n  (Johnson did not take questions at a news conference Monday morning, but he has previously declined to promise such a vote, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune has pledged.)\n \n\n   \n  While Democrats want these tax credits extended from a policy standpoint, you could argue that the best thing for them from a raw-politics standpoint is for Republicans to reject them — and for voters to remember it come 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are already having to deal with explaining the  major Medicaid cuts in Trump’s big agenda bill  over the summer. And unlike those cuts, which are delayed until after the 2026 midterms, these premium increases will go into effect quickly.\n \n\n   \n  At the very least, Democrats have continued to fertilize a potent political argument on bad issue for the GOP.\n \n\n   \n    6. Maybe shutdowns can actually work?\n \n\n   \n  Former Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell often says shutdowns simply don’t work. He said in 2023 that they “never have produced a policy change and they’ve always been a loser for Republicans, politically.”\n \n\n   \n  This shutdown should challenge that conventional wisdom.\n \n\n   \n  No, Democrats didn’t get all or even most of what they wanted. But their ability to largely win the blame game suggests future shutdowns could be successfully leveraged, if the party forcing them plays its cards right.\n \n\n   \n  The big problem with the GOP’s shutdown strategies last decade seemed to be that the things they were shutting the government down over — defunding Obamacare and building a border wall — just weren’t that popular.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats showed that if you push for something that enough people favor, you might have a shot.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/trump-pardon-allies-2020-election-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:57:00-05:00","title":"Trump pardons Rudy Giuliani, others involved in efforts to overturn 2020 election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has issued a wide-ranging presidential pardon to numerous allies and figures involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election, including Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Mark Meadows, Jeffrey Clark, Ken Chesebro, John Eastman, Jenna Ellis, Kelli Ward, Michael Ward, and Boris Epshteyn.

Karina Tsui, Michael Williams, Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:57 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  has pardoned a long list of his political allies for their support or involvement in plans to overturn the 2020 presidential election, according to the Department of Justice’s Pardon Attorney, Ed Martin.\n \n\n   \n  The individuals listed in a proclamation, which Martin  posted on X  late Sunday, include high-profile figures like former   Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and the president’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, among dozens of others.\n \n\n   \n  “This proclamation ends a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 Presidential Election and continues the process of national reconciliation,” read the document, which gives the date of November 7 in its text and the president appears to have signed.\n \n\n   \n  It includes a “full, complete, and unconditional pardon” for those named, including some of the president’s co-defendants who were charged in Georgia for trying to  subvert Trump’s 2020 election defeat .\n \n\n   \n  The pardons mark the latest step Trump has taken to absolve or protect his allies who tried to overturn the 2020 election. Those efforts culminated in the violent riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. One of his first official acts in his second term was to pardon over 1,000 people who were charged or convicted in the January 6 ​attack.\n \n\n   \n  Presidential pardons only apply to federal charges, not state or local charges. None of the people on the list are currently charged with federal crimes, though some were named as unindicted co-conspirators in special counsel Jack Smith’s election subversion case against Trump, which prosecutors withdrew after Trump’s 2024 election victory.\n \n\n   \n  However, state-level criminal charges are still pending against Giuliani, Meadows, many of the 2020 fake electors, and others on the pardon list. (They deny wrongdoing.) These 2020-related state prosecutions are ongoing in Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada. These figures will likely try to use the pardon to aid their defense, though a presidential pardon doesn’t cover state crimes.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon also explicitly states that it does not apply to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon covers Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official in 2020 who  tried to weaponize   the department’s powers to overturn the election. (Clark is now a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget.) Like Giuliani and Powell, Clark was an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal 2020-related indictment against Trump,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Clark said in  an X post  Monday that Trump had called him on Friday to inform him about the pardon. He said that he never asked for a pardon, defended his actions in 2020, and thanked Trump. But he also acknowledged the limits of clemency action.\n \n\n   \n  “I wish I could be declaring this legal nonsense over for good — a pardon should totally and abruptly kill off these federal bar and Georgia-federal attacks on me and many others,” Clark wrote. “Sadly, that’s not immediate reality.”\n \n\n   \n  Powell and Giuliani, both of whom served as Trump’s personal lawyers, were at the center of the sprawling conspiracy theories which baselessly claimed the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. Giuliani  played a leading role  in the “fake electors” scheme which sought to block then-President-elect Joe Biden from taking office by presenting certificates from battleground states which falsely said Trump won the election, during the Congressional counting of the electoral votes on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Giuliani spokesperson Ted Goodman said in a statement that the former New York City mayor “stands by his work following the 2020 presidential election,” adding that he “never sought a pardon but is deeply grateful for President Trump’s decision.”\n \n\n   \n  Two of the architects of the fake electors scheme — lawyers  Ken Chesebro  and John Eastman — were also pardoned. Chesebro previously pleaded guilty in the Georgia election racketeering indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Also pardoned were Jenna Ellis, Trump’s 2020 campaign lawyer, and former Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward and her husband, Michael Ward.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis had been accused of working to spread false claims about widespread voter fraud. She  pleaded guilty  in the Georgia case and struck a cooperation deal that led to her Arizona charges  being dropped . The Wards were accused of acting as fake electors in Arizona. Also pardoned was Boris Epshteyn, a Trump campaign lawyer who prosecutors alleged  helped organized  the scheme and later served as one of Trump’s personal lawyer during his New York criminal trial in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the people Trump pardoned as “great Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  “These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,” Leavitt said. “Getting prosecuted for challenging results is something that happens in communist Venezuela, not the United States of America, and President Trump is putting an end to the Biden Regime’s communist tactics once and for all.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Martin’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Also last week, the president  granted clemency  to a retired New York City police officer who was convicted in 2023 for stalking a New Jersey family on behalf of the Chinese government.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also pardoned former Major League Baseball star  Darryl Strawberry  for a 1995 tax evasion charge.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/business/visa-mastercard-deal-merchant-fees","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:47:00-05:00","title":"Visa and Mastercard Propose Fee Cut for Merchants Amid Retailer Opposition","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Visa and Mastercard have proposed a settlement to lower interchange fees by 0.1% over five years, offering merchants more flexibility such as the ability to add surcharges or refuse premium cards.

In 2024,  over a third  of all purchases were made with credit cards and those who use them might face new surcharges when they swipe or have to use another form of payment if businesses don’t accept their card.\n \n\n   \n  And because credit card companies finance credit card rewards, lower interchange fees may mean fewer perks. “If you were to lower interchange fees, you probably have to also lower rewards,” Joanna Stavins, principal economist and policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston told CNN last month. That’s because “rewards are financed by interchange fees.”\n \n\n   \n  The two credit card giants have been entangled in a lawsuit brought by retailers for the last 20 years that alleged the companies have fixed the price of interchange fees — a large portion of the fees merchants pay when a customer makes a purchase with a credit card. The companies were close to reaching a settlement last year, but U.S. District Judge Margo K. Brodie  rejected  the $30 billion proposal.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal announced this morning would see the two companies bring down interchange fees by 0.1% over the next five years, give merchants the choice to add surcharges when customers pay with credit cards as well as the option to refuse premium cards, which often charge substantially  higher fees .\n \n\n   \n  “After more than 20 years of litigation, Visa and Mastercard have reached a proposed settlement with U.S. merchants of all sizes that would provide meaningful relief, more flexibility and options to control how they accept payments from their customers,” Visa told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mastercard said that “smaller merchants will gain in this settlement – more acceptance choices, reduced costs and simplified rules.”\n \n\n   \n  The proposal from Visa and Mastercard specifically states that the deal is not an admission of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The National Retail Federation, a powerful trade group representing retailers, called the proposal “ window dressing .” A press release issued in response to reports of the proposal said the reduction in interchange fees doesn’t go far enough to address the rise in interchange fees, which they say average around 2.35%.\n \n\n   \n  The European Union capped credit card interchange fees at 0.3% in 2015.\n \n\n   \n  Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that they believe the proposal from Visa and Mastercard, which has accumulated widespread opposition from retailers, is unlikely to be enacted.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s remarkable that anyone could think a temporary 10 basis point reduction — barely more than last year’s increase — is fair compensation for allowing a credit card duopoly to maintain their pricing cartel for eight more years,” said the National Restaurant Federation.\n \n\n   \n  “If the courts can’t fix this, it’s time for Congress to take action,” said the National Retail Federation’s General Counsel Stephanie Martz.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting and context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/entertainment/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-holiday-special-netflix","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Meghan, Duchess of Sussex to Show How to Do Holidays Montecito-Style in New Netflix Special","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Meghan, Duchess of Sussex is set to release a new Netflix holiday special, 'With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration', on December 3, 2025.

been released from prison after a Paris court ruled Monday he could be freed pending an appeal for his September conviction for criminal conspiracy, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.\n \n\n   \n  He was convicted for his involvement in a scheme to finance his 2007 presidential  campaign with funds  from Libya in exchange for diplomatic favors.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on social media after his release, Sarkozy expressed his gratitude to all those who had “supported” and “defended” him, vowing that the “truth will prevail” in his upcoming appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “I will now prepare the appeal trial. My energy is focused solely on the single goal of proving my innocence,” Sarkozy said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier on Monday, before his release, Sarkozy addressed a court hearing via videolink, he said that his 20 days in prison had been, “very hard.”\n \n\n   \n  He paid tribute to prison staff during his hearing Monday, adding that they had, “an exceptional humanity which made this nightmare bearable.”\n \n\n   \n  According to French magazine Le Point, Sarkozy had refused to eat anything except yogurts during his nearly three-week stint behind bars, reportedly due to fear other prisoners might spit in his food.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors requested Sarkozy be released under judicial control, with restrictions on whom he can contact.\n \n\n   \n  The court ruled that the former head of state will be forbidden from leaving France.\n \n\n   \n  The court also specified that Sarkozy is forbidden from contacting people implicated in his case as well as the current French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin, who came under public scrutiny for visiting Sarkozy in prison in October, according to BFMTV.\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement posted to X  shortly before Sarkozy set off for prison on October 21, Sarkozy stressed that he was an “innocent man.” Upon his conviction, he railed against the decision to find him guilty.\n \n\n   \n  “If they absolutely want me to sleep in prison, I will sleep in prison. But with my head held high,” he told journalists after his sentencing hearing, his voice boiling with anger.\n \n\n   \n  He released a list of three books he took into prison, including two volumes of “The Count of Monte Cristo” and a biography of Jesus Christ.\n \n\n   \n  The former president, who left office in 2012, had been expected to occupy a cell either in solitary confinement or in the so-called “VIP wing” of La Santé prison complex while awaiting his appeal on the conviction.\n \n\n   \n  That wing is usually reserved for prisoners who are considered unsuitable to be kept among the prison’s general population, usually out of fears for their safety. They could be politicians, former police officers, members of far-right organizations or those tied to Islamist terror groups, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  Cells in the wing are fitted with a metal bed and mattress, a small desk, a fridge, a cooking hob, a television, a shower, toilet and sink, and a fixed telephone line allowing prisoners to call certain authorized numbers.\n \n\n   \n  Previous inmates include Manuel Noriega, the former dictator of Panama who was held there following his extradition from the United States after the American invasion that deposed him.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/rastafarian-landor-dreadlocks-supreme-court","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:23:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court leans against Rastafarian man seeking to sue prison officials for cutting his dreadlocks","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has shown reluctance to support Damon Landor’s claim to sue prison officials in Louisiana for forcibly cutting his dreadlocks, which he maintained were in accordance with his Rastafarian religious beliefs and a Nazarite vow.

Minutes earlier, Landor had handed them a judicial opinion requiring prisons to allow dreadlocks for religious purposes.\n \n\n   \n  On the one hand, the case appeared tailor-made for a conservative Supreme Court that has consistently sided with religious interests in recent years. But over the course of nearly two hours of argument, it became clear that the conservative wing is far more concerned with allowing people to sue individual state officials as a way to  enforce federal spending laws .\n \n\n   \n  That’s largely because, several justices suggested, those individual state employees were not likely aware of the agreements states had made in exchange for federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, the facts of this case are egregious,” said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court’s conservative wing. But, she said, “we can’t decide a case just based on these facts.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Neil Gorsuch, another conservative who is among the court’s most ardent supporters of religious rights, suggested that under Landor’s theory, a cisgender woman trying out for a sports team on a college campus that receives federal funding could sue a coach personally for $1 million in damages for allowing a transgender woman onto that team.\n \n\n   \n  It was a notable question in part because the court is expected in coming weeks to hear arguments on whether states may ban transgender athletes from competing on teams consistent with their gender identity.\n \n\n   \n  “As I understand it,” Gorsuch said, the federal appeals courts “are unanimously against you and have been for many, many, many years.”\n \n\n   \n  A panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals  ruled that Landor was not entitled to sue  under a 25-year-old law intended to protect prisoners’ religious interests.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative New Orleans-based 5th Circuit said that it “emphatically” condemned “the treatment that Landor endured,” but an earlier appeals court precedent settled the case against him. The full 5th Circuit ultimately  decided against  rehearing the case.\n \n\n   \n  Landor, who began serving a five-month prison sentence in 2020 for drug possession, had previously taken a promise known as the Nazarite vow to not cut his hair.\n \n\n   \n  He was incarcerated without incident at two other facilities before he was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center with only a few weeks left in his sentence. And he came armed with a copy of an appeals court ruling from 2017 that allowed prisoners to have dreadlocks.\n \n\n   \n  Landor’s case at the Supreme Court rests on the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA. Congress passed that law, and another that dealt with religious accommodation more widely, in response to a landmark but controversial 1990 precedent from the court. Five years ago, the  justices ruled that the other law , which has nearly identical language, does allow people whose religious rights have been burdened to seek damages against government officials acting in their individual capacity.\n \n\n   \n  But Louisiana countered that RLUIPA is effectively a spending contract between the federal government, which provides funding for state prisons, and state officials. The individual officials involved in Landor’s forced shaving were not a party to that contract, Louisiana said, so they can’t be held personally liable.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Justice John Roberts said Landor’s argument that state employees had received notice rested on a “legal fiction.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think when the prison guard is hired, he says, ‘well, I want to see the federal conditions that you agreed to under the contract,’” Roberts said.\n \n\n   \n  The court’s three-justice liberal wing saved most of its toughest questions for Louisiana’s attorney.\n \n\n   \n  The court is likely to hand down a decision in the case next year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/flight-delays-cancellations-tracker-vis","dateOfPublication":"1244-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:44:00-05:00","title":"Tracking US flight delays and cancellations in charts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Airlines across the U.S. have reduced domestic flights by 4% at 40 of the busiest airports following a directive from the Federal Aviation Administration, amid escalating flight cancellations.

What You Need to Know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has proposed sending $2,000 rebate checks to Americans as a form of compensation for tariffs he has imposed on imported goods, claiming that the revenue generated from these tariffs could be used to fund the checks. The proposal, first floated in August and reiterated on Truth Social in November 2025, draws parallels to pandemic stimulus checks but faces significant financial, legal, and political challenges. Treasury officials and experts argue that the total cost—estimated at over $300 billion—exceeds the tariff revenue collected since the start of Trump’s second term. The Supreme Court has questioned the legality of using emergency powers to collect tariffs, which could undermine the revenue base. Congress, which controls fiscal policy, has not approved such a program and is unlikely to endorse it without broader economic justification.

What you need to know \n       \n  By David Goldman, Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump, embattled by America’s growing  affordability problems , has once again floated a unique solution: Sending Americans rebate checks for the tariffs that his administration has collected.\n \n\n   \n  “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump  posted on Truth Social  Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a bold promise with several significant complications.\n \n\n   \n    What Trump proposed\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently floated the idea of tariff rebate checks. Prior to this weekend’s proposal, Trump in August had said Americans could  receive a portion of the tariff revenue .\n \n\n   \n  “We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,” Trump said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  While American importers foot the initial tariff bill, they’ve been passing along some of those added costs to consumers, meaning Americans are indirectly paying for tariffs, too.\n \n\n   \n  The idea sounds similar to stimulus checks that went out in the wake of the pandemic recession — once towards the end of Trump’s first term, in 2020; and again in 2021 when former President Joe Biden was in office. But Trump suggested that these tariff rebate checks could be funded not by a general pool of taxpayer funds but instead from the money collected by US importers who pay the historic tariffs Trump has imposed on a vast number of goods from overseas.\n \n\n   \n    What the Treasury says\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s top economic adviser threw some cold water on the rebate checks.\n \n\n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was noncommittal about the proposal on Sunday in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” Bessent said no formal proposals have been made to distribute tariff revenue and suggested Trump’s mention of a $2,000 payment “could come in lots of forms,” including making up for lost revenue from not taxing tips, overtime and Social Security payments.\n \n\n   \n    Is there even enough money for this?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has collected more than $220 billion in tariff revenue, which includes a mix of various tariffs Trump has imposed and previous tariffs that were in place before Trump took office, according to the US Treasury.\n \n\n   \n  More than 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024, the  IRS said .\n \n\n   \n  So a back-of-the-envelope calculation would put $2,000 stimulus checks at a total cost of about $326 billion. That’s more than the tariff revenue America has collected since Trump’s second term began.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he would exclude wealthy Americans, but it’s not clear where the cut-off would be and whether that could make up for the difference.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an income threshold of $100,000 — far from the highest income tax bracket — around 150 million adults would qualify. That would cost the administration roughly $300 billion, wrote Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  According to a Monday morning social media post, the president seems to think there would be enough money left after tariff rebate checks are doled out to help pay down the nation’s nearly $40 trillion in debt.\n \n\n   \n  “All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens, from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries, which will be substantial, will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official didn’t specify what requirements would need to be met to qualify for a check. “The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,” the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    What about the Supreme Court?\n \n\n   \n  Another complicating factor: The  Supreme Court appears skeptical  of the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. About $100 billion of the total tariff revenue so far has been collected through this method.\n \n\n   \n  If the court rules against the Trump administration, it may have to  return that money to businesses , which would significantly reduce the amount of tariff money available as a rebate for American households.\n \n\n   \n  It could also complicate the process of refunding businesses if money has already been distributed to individuals.\n \n\n   \n    Can Trump do this unilaterally?\n \n\n   \n  Almost certainly not.\n \n\n   \n  Congress maintains the power of the purse, and past stimulus checks have required Congressional approval, and it’s unclear if Trump has enough support to pass something like this.\n \n\n   \n    Would Congress support it?\n \n\n   \n  Although stimulus checks have proven politically popular in the past, they have come almost exclusively during recessions or emergencies. The American economy is in neither at the moment.\n \n\n   \n  Rebate checks could exacerbate rising prices at a time when Americans say  inflation and affordability  are their top concern. Sending out checks could give America’s economy a sugar rush at the worst possible time and could ultimately ding American households if the Federal Reserve needs to hike its benchmark interest rate to counteract rising prices.\n \n\n   \n  That could lose Trump some key votes among fiscal conservatives in his own party.\n \n\n   \n    When would my check come?\n \n\n   \n  Even if the rebate checks get approval, don’t hold your breath.\n \n\n   \n  During the pandemic, Americans who elected to receive direct deposit checks had the money in their bank accounts within about a week of the first stimulus package passing. Where it got much more dicey was for the Americans who elected to receive paper checks. That process took around 20 weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/military-teachers-pay-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-05:00","title":"Teachers Working Without Pay in US Military Schools During Shutdown Received Debt Letters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the 2025 government shutdown that began on October 1, teachers and civilian staff at US military schools operated by the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA) worked without pay.

   11:22 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Teachers and other employees of US military schools who have been working without pay during the  government shutdown  received letters this week telling them they owed money to the government, CNN has learned.\n \n\n   \n  Debt letters outlining that personnel have been “overpaid” by various amounts ranging from several hundred dollars to more than $1,000, according to letters viewed by CNN. The letters, sent by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, told employees they have 70 days from the date of the letter to pay the debts.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA) told employees that the letters were sent out in error due to a glitch that will be corrected once the government is funded. But impacted employees told CNN the letters added to the stress of Defense Department civilians who have been deemed essential and have worked without pay since the shutdown began on October 1. Sources familiar with the letters told CNN it was sent to not only teachers, but principals and other administrative DoDEA employees.\n \n\n   \n  “DoDEA claims it will be corrected at some point after the shutdown ends but gave no indication of when or what the process to correct it will be,” one employee said. “So, in the meantime, DoDEA teachers will continue to not only work for no pay but also be charged a debt for each day we are forced to work without pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Another DOD civilian pointed to longstanding issues with the military’s pay system and said they have little faith the issue will be resolved quickly. A third individual living overseas posted on social media that they received the letter and said the stress “is becoming overwhelming.”\n \n\n   \n  The DoDEA system has 161 schools at home and abroad at US military installations, according to the agency’s website, and teaches more than 60,000 students. As of 2022, there were more than 11,000 full-time personnel within DoDEA.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has ensured active members of the military are being paid throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The director of the DoDEA, Beth Schiavino-Narvaez, told employees in an email on Thursday, which was obtained by CNN, that the agency is aware of the “various pay-related issues.” DoDEA is “working closely with the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) to obtain all necessary information regarding the problems that are employees are experiencing due to payroll status changes,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The issue largely was due to a coding error due to the shutdown, Schiavino-Narvaez’s email said. All employees must be identified by a code for “Leave Without Pay” during the lapse in appropriations for timekeeping purposes, she said. Teachers and administrators’ salaries are based on the number of days in a school year they are paid for, the email goes on to explain, and therefore when a Leave Without Pay code is entered into the pay system, “the payroll system automatically adjusts for overpayment because fewer than the required number of days will be recorded.”\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, due to the age of its system and regulatory requirements, DFAS is unable to override these adjustments, and a debt letter is automatically issued,” the director’s email said.\n \n\n   \n  Schiavino-Narvaez specifies in the email that once the government is funded, timecards will be corrected – but she also told employees that it may take “several pay periods to fully reconcile and cancel” any outstanding debt.\n \n\n   \n  Employees “are not required to make any payments on debt letters at this time,” she said, adding that she recognizes “we are all experiencing extraordinary challenges due to the lapse in appropriations.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  previously reported  that the morale of civilian employees around the globe — many of whom are veterans or military family members themselves — is dropping rapidly with many considering leaving government service.\n \n\n   \n  The first affected DoDEA employee told CNN that to say the director’s reassurances “don’t mean much is an understatement.”\n \n\n   \n  “They have no urgency to correct this and just tell us to basically wait and hope for the best,” the employee said, “because they don’t know how to fix this and don’t seem overly concerned with finding a method to fix this.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/entertainment/hot-ones-jolly-food-celebrity-interviews","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"Wings, fried chicken and British delicacies: How an appetite for originality transformed celebrity interviews","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the rise of food-based celebrity interviews as a transformative trend in media, driven by shows like Hot Ones and JOLLY.

Even  I Love to Eat , the first network TV cooking show to air in the US back in 1946, featured famous designer and actress, Elsie de Wolfe.\n \n\n   \n  Morning shows, too, have for decades welcomed celebrities into their set kitchens for early-morning meal-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is entertainment, it’s something you bond over,” Moore told CNN, “Food is culture. People want to interact with each other, and food provides the glue for that.”\n \n\n   \n  In the mid-2010s, the format saw a new iteration of the approach emerge with a gourmet of YouTube shows featuring hungry celebrities – a disruption to what Evans called a “boring,” “PR-driven flight pattern.”\n \n\n   \n  “Hot Ones” mixed up the media blitz. Ten years after its first episode, it is now a desired destination for megastars such as Jennifer Lawrance, Idris Elba,  Lady Gaga  and Shaquille O’Neal, whose reactions to the exponential Scoville levels have been immortalized in internet lore.\n \n\n   \n  “What these food-driven formats reveal is that adding a slice of real life to the interview process (a meal, a drink, or any shared activity) invites authenticity, connection and unexpected honesty,” Lindsay Colker, founder of Elevate Communications, a Los Angeles-based public relations and consulting boutique, told CNN. “And that’s where the magic and the viral moments tend to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Colker highlighted the format’s ability to blur the lines between “press appearance and personality showcase,” which is aided by hosts who are “often culture-shapers in their own right - disarming, conversational and curious.”\n \n\n   \n  “They know how to draw out personality instead of polished talking points,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But she emphasized that food-themed interviews – and the wave of new media at large – are complementary and not a replacement to traditional celebrity coverage.\n \n\n   \n  What’s remarkable about these YouTube food-themed interviews is the fact that the ingredients to their success aren’t concealed in secret family heirloom or fabled recipes; no 11 herbs and spices kept away from the other online creators. It’s a straightforward blend of originality, ingenuity and accessibility.\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY had already invested years in creating food content prior to featuring celebrities in their videos. Josh Carrott, the other half of JOLLY, and Kendal said that getting celebrities to share food and culture away from the “sterile, sanitized junket world,” is not a fading gimmick they’re squeezing for views.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is like the great connector,” Carrott said. “I think over the years, our content has evolved into sharing culture through food.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Like’ and subscribe\n \n\n   \n  Evans likens the growth of food-themed interviews to that of podcasts, which were once relatively obscure but are now omnipresent.\n \n\n   \n  “The landscape is going to shift,” said Evans, “But, overall, if you like interview shows, you have certainly tons of options, and I think at a higher quality now than 10 years ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Evans celebrates the growth of the niche from “barren, empty shelves” to a marketplace filled with great offerings, but he also acknowledges the concerns that it might be too much, conceding that audience fatigue is plausible in the midst of what he described as the “boom times” of the genre.\n \n\n   \n  Moore said that no matter how famous a host or a guest is, or how elaborate and slick a production is, an unauthentic product will not resonate with audiences.\n \n\n   \n  Colker echoed the sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  “These types of appearances only fatigue clients when they start to feel repetitive or disconnected from their story,” Colker said. “The sweet spot is where creativity meets comfort and when it feels natural, not performative.”\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY’s approach to content creation has always centered the fans as its North Star, which they try to follow through endless trial and error, as well as excruciating analysis of audience metrics. This includes an examination of the kinds of brands and celebrities JOLLY looks to associate with, the best platforms to reach their audience and even the lengths of videos.\n \n\n   \n  “The focus for us has been: Can we make good content that people want to see?” Kendal said, “We’re not really interested in doing content for content’s sake.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether food-themed interviews have reached their inflection point, let alone oversaturation, is yet to be determined. For now, the proof is in the pudding as more online creators and legacy media outlets continue to add to the loaded pantry of this genre.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, Vogue revived an infrequent online cooking segment under a new title,  Now Serving.  YouTuber Quenlin Blackwell’s rebranded her FEEDING STARVING INFLUENCERS series to now feature celebrities. And across the pond, broadcaster Nick Grimshaw and Michelin star chef Angela Hartnett launched  Dish,  where celebrities enjoy conversations over one of Hartnett’s acclaimed creations.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, other creators and outlets have seemingly started to  abandon the concept. Harper’s BAZAAR’s online series,  Food Diaries , was abruptly discontinued in 2023 after a six-year run, and internet personality, Joey Camasta, concluded his raunchy take on the concept after only one season of  Could I Get in Your Pantry?  \n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Hearst and Camasta for comment.\n \n\n   \n  But as long as the media climate provides the perfect temperature for these shows to grow and expand, and until audiences are satiated to the point of nausea, creators will continue to cook up fresh ideas.\n \n\n   \n  Carrott and Kendal are already manifesting their dream episodes: southern biscuits and gravy versus English tea and biscuits with Matthew McConaughey, and going through the Waffle House menu with Prince Harry.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s kind of a perfect example of what we want to achieve,” said Carrott. “Sharing culture and authentic passion over a meal with someone.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-obergefell-kim-davis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:58:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Declines to Revisit Landmark Same-Sex Marriage Precedent","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court declined to revisit its 2015 Obergefell v.

Hodges  allowed same-sex couples to marry.\n \n\n   \n  The court did not explain its reasoning to deny the appeal, which had received outsized attention – in part because the court’s 6-3 conservative majority three years ago overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion that 1973 decision established. Since then, fears about Obergefell being the precedent to fall have grown.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, love won again,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “When public officials take an oath to serve their communities, that promise extends to everyone – including LGBTQ+ people. The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Mat Staver, the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, the legal group that represented Davis, said the former clerk would now face “crippling monetary damages based on nothing more than purported hurt feelings.”\n \n\n   \n  “Like the abortion decision in Roe v. Wade, Obergefell was egregiously wrong from the start,” Staver said. “We will continue to work to overturn Obergefell. It is not a matter of if, but when the Supreme Court will overturn Obergefell.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court today is far different and far more conservative than the one that decided Obergefell in 2015, which is part of what had given LGBTQ advocates pause about the Davis appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, the key swing vote who authored the Obergefell decision, retired in 2018 and was replaced by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon who was also in the Obergefell majority, died in 2020 and was succeeded by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative.\n \n\n   \n  Three current justices – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito – were in dissent in Obergefell.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy’s opinion spoke eloquently of the most fundamental values of family, love and liberty.\n \n\n   \n  “No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family,” Kennedy wrote. “In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were.”\n \n\n   \n  The Obergefell decision prompted a massive celebration that began outside the Supreme Court on the day it was decided in late June of 2015. That evening, the White House was lit in rainbow colors. Many same-sex couples rushed into courthouses to wed. Nearly 600,000 same-sex couples have since married, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.\n \n\n   \n  But some conservatives viewed the outcome as a betrayal and predicted future conflicts with religion. Davis, who at the time was the clerk of Rowan County in Kentucky, cited her religious objection to same-sex marriage as justifying her decision to withhold marriage licenses to all couples. She was sued by multiple couples in the county, and a jury ordered her to pay $360,000 in damages and legal fees.\n \n\n   \n  After a federal court found she had violated a court order to issue licenses, Davis was also thrown in jail for several days.\n \n\n   \n  Writing in dissent, the late Justice Antonin Scalia blasted the court’s decision as a “threat to American democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The substance of today’s decree is not of immense personal importance to me,” he wrote. “But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today’s judicial Putsch.”\n \n\n   \n  Davis had argued that it was time “for a course correction” on Obergefell.\n \n\n   \n  While virtually all of the focus on Davis’ appeal was aimed at her request to overturn Obergefell, the bulk of case actually dealt with a series of more technical questions. In appealing the damages verdict against her, the former clerk argued that the First Amendment’s religious protections should shield her from legal liability, particularly since she is no longer a public official. The 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument.\n \n\n   \n  Several conservatives justices had signaled in recent weeks that there was no great appetite to reopen Obergefell. Barrett  told the  New York Times  last month there are “very concrete reliance interests” at stake when it comes to same-sex marriage. Alito, while criticizing the precedent broadly during an address in Washington earlier this fall, stressed that it was a “precedent of the court that is entitled to the respect afforded by the doctrine of stare decisis.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, there have been worrying signs for LGBTQ rights groups – particularly when it comes to cases involving transgender Americans. In recent months, the high court handed down a major decision allowing states to ban the use of  puberty blockers and hormone therapy  for trans youth, allowed the Trump administration to bar transgender Americans from serving in the military and allowed the administration to require US passports to include sex markers consistent with a  person’s sex at birth .\n \n\n   \n  Mary Bonauto, a veteran civil rights attorney at GLAD Law who argued the Obergefell case, celebrated the court’s quick rejection of Davis’ appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that has changed since  Obergefell  was decided is that people across the country have seen how marriage equality provides protection for families and children, and that protection strengthens communities, the economy and our society,” Bonauto said. “Today millions of Americans can breathe a sigh of relief for their families, current or hoped for, because all families deserve equal rights under the law.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s decision to decline to hear the Davis appeal sets no precedent. If another appeal arrives threatening to undermine or overturn Obergefell, the court will review that appeal from scratch.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional details and reaction. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/reopen-federal-government-next-steps","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:20:00-05:00","title":"The Senate Cleared a Key Hurdle.

But party leaders believe lawmakers will, indeed, end the stalemate this week.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what still needs to happen on Capitol Hill to reopen the federal government.\n \n\n   \n    Senate timing agreement and vote\n \n\n   \n  Now, senators need to agree on how long to debate before voting on the final bill. This could move quickly, or be held up by senators who want to drag out the process.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who voted against advancing the measure, wants a vote on an amendment related to hemp grown in his state. It’s unclear if that will happen.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it “remains to be seen” when the Senate will be able to vote on final passage of the bill, though he hopes it passes early this week.\n \n\n   \n  The final package would fund the government until January 30 and some key agencies through the remainder of fiscal year 2026. So that means if the government were to shut down again over the next few months, key federal food assistance known as SNAP would continue to be funded.\n \n\n   \n  Once it passes the Senate, the package heads to the House, which will present its own host of complications.\n \n\n   \n    Then it’s the House’s turn\n \n\n   \n  Members of the House were advised to expect votes this week.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has to sell this package to his razor-thin majority, and he’ll likely need the president’s help to muscle it through his fractious conference.\n \n\n   \n  Praising the Senate for reaching a deal to reopen the government and warning his members to make their way back to Washington, Johnson said Monday: “I’m stating the obvious all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now, returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson said he will give 36-hour notice to House members for a vote as soon as the Senate has final passage of the CR in the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “At least some Democrats,” he said, “now finally appear ready to do what Republicans and President Trump and millions of hard-working American people have been asking them to do for weeks.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, however, has vowed to fight the package because it does not go as far as he wanted on Democrats’ health care demands, so it’s not yet clear how many House Democrats will help Johnson approve it.\n \n\n   \n  House Democrats are set to huddle as a caucus on Monday, according to a personal familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Though the next few days will be critical, a source familiar with the matter said GOP leaders are optimistic about the funding bill’s chances for passage in the House. And a Democratic source familiar expects some in the party will cross lines to support it, though it remains to be seen how many.\n \n\n   \n  Once passed in the House, the bill will go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the bill?\n \n\n   \n  The full bill includes a larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress, in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The package does not include a guarantee from Republicans to extend the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal struck between Republicans and the Senate Democratic centrists, there’s expected to be a future Senate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government said Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies – a key sticking point for the Democratic Party – forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also includes an agreement to reverse all of the federal firings during the shutdown and ensure that all federal workers get paid what they were owed while the shutdown occurred.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/mail-in-ballots-supreme-court-mississippi","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:56:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Agrees to Decide If Mail-in Ballots Can Arrive After Election Day","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a major case concerning whether states can count mail-in ballots received after Election Day, specifically in response to a Republican-led lawsuit over Mississippi’s law allowing ballots to be received up to five days after Election Day.

November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court  agreed Monday  to decide whether states may count mail-in  ballots received after Election Day , taking up a Republican-led lawsuit that could affect election laws in more than a dozen states across the country.\n \n\n   \n  It is the latest of several high-profile voting cases to make it on to the Supreme Court’s docket this year as the justices are asked to deal with controversies dating back over the past several elections.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen states allow regular mail ballots to be accepted after Election Day, including  presidential battleground Nevada . Most of the nation’s battleground states – including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – require ballots to be received by Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Other states accept military ballots after Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  A Mississippi law, enacted during the Covid-19 pandemic, allows ballots to be received up to five days late, so long as they are postmarked by Election Day. The Republican National Committee and others sued over that law, claiming the provision violated a federal law that fixes the date for the election.\n \n\n   \n  “With rare outliers, the states mandated that ballots must be received by election officials by election day,” the RNC told the Supreme Court in written arguments this year. “But recently, an increasing number of States – including Mississippi – have deviated from that practice by permitting at least some ballots to be received after election day.”\n \n\n   \n  Officials in Mississippi, where  Trump carried more than 60% of the vote , have questioned the RNC’s logic. An election, they told the Supreme Court, is the choice of an official.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters make that choice by casting – marking and submitting – their ballots by election day. The election has then occurred, even if election officials do not receive all ballots by that day,” Mississippi officials said in written arguments. “Under Mississippi law, voters cast their ballots by election day.”\n \n\n   \n  Raising doubts about ballots that were not counted until after Election Day was key to President Donald Trump’s efforts to delegitimize the 2020 election. The question in the case is about ballots that were received after the election, not ballots that are received before the election but not counted until later.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that Mississippi was  violating federal law by counting mail ballots that arrived after Election Day , but the court notably stopped short of blocking the state’s policy before the 2024 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court is already considering other important cases involving voting and elections. It heard arguments in October in a case challenging the power of the Voting Rights Act to limit  discrimination in redistricting . The Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority  signaled deep skepticism  in that case over the creation of a second majority Black district in Louisiana in a case that could have nationwide implications.\n \n\n   \n  And a majority of the court late month indicated it would likely back a Republican congressman from Illinois who is challenging a state law that allows  mail ballots to be received after Election Day , a decision that would let him proceed with a potentially explosive lawsuit that lower courts had rejected.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/ghislaine-maxwell-special-treatment-commutation-raskin-whistleblower","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:43:00-05:00","title":"Ghislaine Maxwell Gets Special Treatment in Prison, Rep.

Here’s what to know about ‘Project Athena’ \n       \n  By Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:11 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A 62-page document written by President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again pick to run NASA,  billionaire Jared Isaacman , outlines a sweeping, ambitious, and at times controversial plan for the space agency.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman, who was  tapped  to be NASA administrator after Trump was elected in 2024, only to see his nomination  retracted  months later, was  renominated  for the top job last Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  While Isaacman has publicly acknowledged the leaked document, which is labeled May 2025 but was recently leaked to several news outlets, he  said  in a social media post that “parts of it are now dated.” He did not specify which portions were obsolete.\n \n\n   \n  It nonetheless set off a flurry of speculation about how the space agency would function with Isaacman at the helm. A copy of the document was obtained and authenticated by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In his statement, which was posted the day of his renomination, Isaacman  said  that “Project Athena,” as the paper is titled, “was always intended to be a living document refined through data gathering post-confirmation.”\n \n\n   \n  “I would think it is better to have a plan going into a responsibility as great as the leadership of NASA than no plan at all,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  Among the proposed goals are revamping some NASA centers to focus on nuclear electric propulsion, establishing a new Mars exploration program, and embracing an “accelerate/fix/delete” philosophy to reshape the agency.\n \n\n   \n  If enacted, many of the policies laid out could significantly alter the day-to-day lives of NASA workers and transform the 67-year-old agency.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it is presenting a more dramatic set of changes than many in the space community were expecting,” said Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society, of the document.\n \n\n   \n  Some lawmakers have also expressed concern about how Isaacman might seek to reform NASA campuses across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman still faces a confirmation vote in the Senate and would need Congressional approval for many of the objectives mapped out in the document.\n \n\n   \n  As a tech CEO — who made his fortune by founding payments company Shift4 at age 16 and has twice  flown to orbit  on self-funded SpaceX missions — Isaacman is an unorthodox pick for NASA’s top role.\n \n\n   \n  Space agency administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics and public servants.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman has also garnered broad support within the commercial space industry, where he’s perceived as an energetic outsider ready to usher NASA into a new era.\n \n\n   \n    A power struggle\n \n\n   \n  According to a source familiar with the matter, the original Project Athena document was more than 100 pages. Isaacman made only three hard copies of a truncated 62-page version and distributed them to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and his chief of staff. The leak — according to a recent Ars Technica report and a source who confirmed the account to CNN — looked to have been part of an effort by Duffy, who is temporarily running NASA, to spur controversy and potentially thwart Isaacman’s renomination.\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously  reported  that Duffy has said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Duffy previously denied that he’s said he wishes to remain in the NASA administrator job, and Isaacman said in his social media statement, posted after the “Project Athena” document was leaked, that he believes Duffy has “great instincts and is an excellent communicator.” (The spokesperson for Duffy did not offer comment for this story.)\n \n\n   \n  “If there is any friction, I suspect it is more political operators causing the controversy,” Isaacman said.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman was renominated for the NASA post on November 4, one day after reports about the Athena document began circulating in the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I think (the people who leaked Project Athena) thought this would ruffle feathers amongst the delegations that care about human spaceflight,” said one former NASA official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private document. “I will tell you — it hasn’t worked.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to nearly a dozen senators whose home states have NASA centers that could be pegged for major changes, according to the Project Athena document. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland — the home of Goddard Space Flight Center — offered the most detailed responses.\n \n\n   \n  Van Hollen said in a statement that he had met with Isaacman earlier this year and he “looks forward to another hearing to discuss further with him why the next space race and the search for habitable planets runs through Maryland.”\n \n\n   \n  “To protect our nation’s innovation leadership, he must be more than a rubber stamp for the Administration’s chainsaw approach to our space science initiatives,” Van Hollen said.\n \n\n   \n  Warner, whose state houses NASA’s Langley campus, urged Isaacman to “engage with Congress and reconsider any plan that threatens these world-class facilities and the communities that depend on them.”\n \n\n   \n  “The reported proposals to downsize or privatize key missions at Langley and Wallops would be a serious mistake, jeopardizing critical scientific capabilities and the talented workforce whose expertise keeps the United States at the forefront of aerospace research,” Warner’s statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  No lawmaker reached by CNN indicated how they intended to vote on Isaacman’s confirmation.\n \n\n   \n    A Mars shot and nuclear propulsion\n \n\n   \n  One eye-popping proposal in Project Athena is to set up a new Mars program, dubbed “Olympus.”\n \n\n   \n  Much of that vision, the source familiar with the document told CNN, was intended to align NASA with SpaceX’s goal of sending an uncrewed Starship spacecraft to the Martian surface next year.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX’s plan, which CEO Elon Musk  discussed  publicly in May, “was going to be a more-or-less free mission that SpaceX was going to do anyway,” the source said. The thinking was that NASA could step in to provide support through the Olympus program at minimal cost to taxpayers, according to the source.\n \n\n   \n  The document also includes numerous mentions of setting up an expansive program to pursue nuclear electric propulsion — which involves powering spacecraft engines with electricity from small nuclear reactors. The technology could one day provide steady, long-lasting power for faster and more flexible deep-space missions, including Mars travel.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has pushed publicly for expanding such research, writing in an August op-ed for  RealClearScience  that he coauthored with Newt Gingrich that the space agency should focus on tasks and research “no other agency, organization, or company is capable of accomplishing.”\n \n\n   \n  Nuclear electric propulsion is an example of such a focus area, the op-ed argues.\n \n\n   \n  “Our competitors are not waiting. China and Russia are investing heavily in nuclear space technologies. If America wants to lead, NASA must take on the hard problems again and do the near-impossible,” Isaacman and Gingrich wrote in the article.\n \n\n   \n  Project Athena also suggests setting up a demonstration mission to dock a nuclear electric propulsion spacecraft with a crewed vehicle in orbit, according to the leaked paper.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s nuclear vision also proposes that NASA centers working on projects like the  Space Launch System rocket  — including the Marshall and Michoud facilities in Alabama and Louisiana — shift their focus to nuclear electric propulsion development when the SLS program concludes.\n \n\n   \n  When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said Tuberville had not met with Isaacman yet but he “will, of course, ask about Marshall.”\n \n\n   \n  The source familiar with the document noted that it was crafted around the same time the Trump White House drafted the President’s Budget Request, or PBR, which called for canceling NASA’s SLS rocket and some other major projects that could have left multiple NASA centers without a cornerstone program.\n \n\n   \n  The source said that Isaacman began compiling the Project Athena document in late 2024 and updated it as he had conversations with policymakers. The source also said that Isaacman did not help draft the PBR.\n \n\n   \n  With this summer’s “Big Beautiful Bill” expressly extending the SLS program through at least the next four missions, it appears Isaacman may delay implementing a bold new focus on nuclear electric propulsion research.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman  said  November 4 on social media that he hopes to zero-in on those pursuits only after a “foundation” of lunar exploration has been built.\n \n\n   \n    To the moon\n \n\n   \n  When the Project Athena document was drafted in early 2025, Trump had already signaled a renewed interest in Mars — even mentioning exploration of the planet in his  inaugural address  while staying silent on NASA’s ongoing efforts to return astronauts to the moon.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman echoed Trump’s Mars ambitions during a confirmation hearing in April, saying he intended to pursue exploration of the red planet in tandem with NASA’s moon program. However, questions about how he would fund such projects  loomed .\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, however, the moon has emerged as the  clear policy priority  amid a renewed space race with China, which is aiming to land its taikonauts on the lunar surface by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  The recent push to bolster NASA’s moon missions, including a $10 billion influx Congress gave the agency’s human spaceflight efforts in July, “brings clarity to the topic,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman is back in the running for the top NASA job at a time when the agency’s plans for a crewed moon landing, called Artemis III, are  in flux .\n \n\n   \n    Shifting lunar plans\n \n\n   \n  The Artemis III mission, which is slated to launch later this decade, currently hinges on SpaceX’s Starship ferrying NASA astronauts down to the lunar surface.\n \n\n   \n  But some policy experts have grown increasingly  concerned  that Starship — the most powerful rocket ever built — is too large, novel and complex to meet NASA’s urgent timeline.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy recently signaled  a willingness to boot SpaceX  off the project, saying he would ask the company and its chief competitor, Blue Origin, to show how they could expedite development of their respective lunar landers.\n \n\n   \n  Those remarks prompted an acerbic response from Musk, a friend of Isaacman’s, who referred to the interim NASA leader as “ Sean Dummy .”\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has not publicly said whether he would support sidelining SpaceX from the Artemis III mission. But a source familiar with the matter said that Isaacman has expressed an intention to partner with whichever company most quickly produces an astronaut-worthy lunar lander.\n \n\n   \n  The Project Athena “plan never favored any one vendor, never recommended closing centers, or directed the cancellation of programs before objectives were achieved,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The plan valued human exploration as much as scientific discovery,” Isaacman said. “It was written as a starting place to give NASA, international partners, and the commercial sector the best chance for long-term success.”\n \n\n   \n    Uncertainty for science\n \n\n   \n  The source familiar with the Project Athena document said some of the more controversial aspects of the plan warrant more explanation.\n \n\n   \n  One line item in the document, for example, states that Isaacman intends to take “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and leave it for academia to determine” — a proposal that critics say said could impede the nation’s ability to gather crucial environmental data.\n \n\n   \n  The document also maps out similar policies that could be applied across many of NASA’s initiatives, such as recommendations to embrace “science-as-service” for future projects.\n \n\n   \n  Such measures, calling for researchers to focus on purchasing data from the private sector, could mark a significant change for the agency.\n \n\n   \n  Similar policy philosophies have been tried at NASA, particularly in the 1990s during a “better, faster, cheaper reformulation,” Dreier noted. But enthusiasm waned for that approach when a  pair of Mars missions  were lost.\n \n\n   \n  And the commercial space industry may not be in a position to take up all the tasks Isaacman’s Athena document suggests it can, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It places a lot of faith on the commercial marketplace to deliver in ways that it hasn’t had the chance to fully be tested on,” Dreier said.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s social media statement also acknowledges his “science-as-a-service” concept “got people fired up” but clarified that he intended to focus on purchasing data from Earth observation satellites: “Why build bespoke satellites at greater cost and delay when you could pay for the data as needed from existing providers and repurpose the funds for more planetary science missions (as an example)?”\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has also publicly defended science programs such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was slated for budget cuts in the PBR. And he stated he’d be willing to spend his own money to get the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope off the ground. “I was prepared to personally cover the cost to launch Roman — if that’s what it took to get to the science,” Isaacman said in a June social media  post . (That same promise appears in the Project Athena document.)\n \n\n   \n  “Anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue,” Isaacman’s November 4 statement reads.\n \n\n   \n    A rankled workforce\n \n\n   \n  Among the other proposals in the Project Athena document are plans to hasten NASA’s reorganization. The agency has already lost roughly 4,000 of its 18,000 employees as part of the Trump administration’s deferred resignation program.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman said in his social media statement last week that he wishes to move away from rolling out piecemeal change and instead implement “a single, data-driven reorganization aimed at reducing layers of bureaucracy between leadership and the engineers, researchers, and technicians.”\n \n\n   \n  Extensive changes, however, could further disgruntle a workforce that has been  reeling  from looming budget cuts and what employees have  described  as political distractions and discordant communication from leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s document also details myriad other plans to change how the agency operates — such as conducting a sweeping review of NASA’s boards and committees to suspend any that “delay decision making,” and reimagine the space agency’s approach to risk assessment.\n \n\n   \n  “We will ensure safety is at the forefront of our decisions but achieving the mission of NASA means accepting that some risks are worth taking,” the document reads.\n \n\n   \n  Former NASA astronaut and SpaceX advisor Garrett Reisman, who has long said he believes NASA may have become too risk-averse in the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster, told CNN in a November 8 phone interview he was encouraged to see that Isaacman hopes to reevaluate that aspect of the agency.\n \n\n   \n  It would be unwise, he added, to start eliminating safety organizations — but they could be revamped to create a “healthy tension” between risk assessors and engineers seeking to push boundaries.\n \n\n   \n  However, he cautioned that “it’s really hard to know in the moment if you’re going too far or not,” Reisman said. “It’s a very difficult thing to do, so I wish him good luck.”\n \n\n   \n    A leader of change\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman is generally well regarded across the space industry, where he has largely been viewed as a passionate leader who can enact visionary change.\n \n\n   \n  In an emailed statement, Dreier, the Planetary Society executive, acknowledged that the Project Athena document “was prepared in a different era.” NASA has since received billions of dollars for projects including lunar exploration, Dreier noted, and science advocates have demonstrated an outpouring of opposition to Trump’s proposed cuts to research.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s renomination to the NASA chief job now presents “a good opportunity to engage on some of these proposals, particularly as they relate to science,” Dreier added.\n \n\n   \n  In his social media post, Isaacman said that, if the Project Athena document becomes public, “I will stand behind it,” adding that he believes “there are many elements of the plan that the space community and NASA would find exciting.”\n \n\n   \n  But he did not wish to debate the plan “line-by-line while NASA and the rest of the government are going through a shutdown,” according to the November 4 post.\n \n\n   \n  More broadly, Isaacman has suggested he intends to enter the NASA job with an open mind and adjust course based on feedback.\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post in June, for example, Isaacman wrote that he “didn’t love” being approached by “people who thought they were uniquely NASA’s savior.” He added: “I have little interest in doing the same.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/entertainment/sissy-spacek-carrie-blood","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:47:00-05:00","title":"Sissy Spacek says getting doused in fake pig’s blood was ‘terrible’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sissy Spacek, reflecting on the 50th anniversary of the 1976 horror film 'Carrie,' described the infamous scene in which she is doused with pig’s blood as 'terrible' and recalled the sticky, unpleasant nature of the filming.

   \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s second nature for some people to pour a glass of wine on a nice evening or to pop open a can of beer during a sports event — but when does drinking become too much?\n \n\n   \n  Heavy alcohol use, which researchers defined as regular alcohol consumption of three or more drinks per day, is linked to more severe brain bleeds (or a bleeding stroke) and earlier long-term brain damage, according to a study published November 5, in the journal  Neurology .\n \n\n   \n  “A bleeding stroke, or intracerebral hemorrhage, is when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, causing blood to leak out and damage the surrounding brain tissue. Bleeding strokes account for about (15% to 20%) of all strokes,” Dr. Mitchell Elkind, chief science officer of brain health and stroke at the American Heart Association, said in an email. He was not part of the study.\n \n\n   \n  “The other kind of stroke, about 80%, is an  ischemic stroke , in which a clot or blockage of the blood vessel occurs and there is a lack of blood flow to part of the brain, causing it to die from lack of oxygen and nutrients,” Elkind said. “Bleeding strokes are typically more dangerous and disabling.”\n \n\n   \n  Some  17%  of adults in the United States binge drink and 6% drink heavily, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2024,  29.7 million  Americans ages 12 and older had alcohol use disorder, a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption that can cause impairment of physical or mental health.\n \n\n   \n  “People who were drinking an average of three glasses of alcohol per day had their brain bleeds on an average of 11 years younger than compared to people who were drinking less glasses of alcohol,” said Dr. M. Edip Gurol, the study’s lead author.\n \n\n   \n    Who is at risk of a bleeding stroke?\n \n\n   \n  In the United States,  795,000 people  experience a stroke each year, and 10% of those are bleeding strokes.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, anyone — even children — can have a bleeding stroke. But the risks go up quickly with age, especially after age 55 or so,” said Elkind, professor emeritus of neurology and epidemiology at Columbia University. “The most important risk factor for brain hemorrhage overall is high blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension increases with age. Recently we have been seeing more strokes in younger people due to increasing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in young adults.”\n \n\n   \n   Nearly half of American adults , or 119.9 million people, have hypertension or high blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Some  symptoms  of high blood pressure include headaches, shortness of breath and nosebleeds.\n \n\n   \n  “Another important cause of strokes in younger people is the use of illicit substances: so not just alcohol, but use of cocaine, methamphetamine and other stimulants, heroin and other injected drugs, can lead to strokes and brain hemorrhages,” Elkind said. “Alcohol — and stimulants, in particular — can increase blood pressure, leading to higher risk of strokes of all types, including bleeding.”\n \n\n   \n  Other than stroke,  hypertension  can also cause chronic kidney disease, heart disease and artery disease.\n \n\n   \n  “For patients who had a brain bleed or patients who have MRI markers of higher than usual brain bleeding risk such as brain microbleeds, I recommend them to completely stop alcohol intake or use it very sparingly,” said Gurol, a vascular neurologist at Mass General Brigham, suggesting no more than up to six times per year and never exceeding more than a glass over 24 hours.\n \n\n   \n    Decreasing your risk of a bleeding stroke\n \n\n   \n  Elkind recommends getting your blood pressure under control to help prevent a stroke.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it checked by a doctor or at a local pharmacy,” he said, “and if elevated, get it under control through lifestyle change and medication, if needed.”\n \n\n   \n  An easy way to lower blood pressure is to do aerobic exercises, such as  walking . Following good  walking form  by standing tall with your shoulders back and swinging your arms and practicing  conscious or nasal breathing  will help regulate your body.\n \n\n   \n  Changes in your diet, such as  reducing salt intake  and following a  Mediterranean diet , can also improve heart health and lower blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  The new study’s findings were based on data collected from 1,600 adults with a median age of 75 who were hospitalized for intracerebral hemorrhage. Participants were all admitted patients at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and were predominantly White.\n \n\n   \n  Since data was collected retrospectively, it “could be biased by the occurrence of the hemorrhage itself: people or proxies may report higher levels of alcohol consumption after a life-changing event like a cerebral hemorrhage. This could lead to biased estimates of the effect,” Elkind said. “In a true prospectively designed study, the data about alcohol consumption would be collected before the hemorrhage had occurred.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/boat-strike-76-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:07:00-05:00","title":"US military strikes 2 boats, killing 6 in Eastern Pacific","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military conducted two strikes in the Eastern Pacific against vessels suspected of carrying illicit narcotics, killing six people and bringing the total fatalities to 76 across 19 attacks.

internet’s attention: a sharply dressed young man, wearing a three-piece suit and a fedora tilted just so.\n \n\n   \n  As speculation swirled about the identity of the so-called “French detective” pictured at the scene, 15-year-old Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, who featured in the photo, was enjoying his new double life.\n \n\n   \n  The teenager met CNN at his home in Rambouillet, about 30 miles southwest of the French capital, to discuss the social media furor.\n \n\n   \n  Though he may cite fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot as a style icon, Pedro confirmed that he was not involved

with the now-famous image. The video had nearly 6 million views.\n \n\n   \n  “In the moment, it was, like, very funny. And we went back to the Louvre to see the reaction of the people,” he told CNN. “People maybe recognized me, but I’m not sure.”\n \n\n   \n  Pedro had planned to spend October 19, the day of the Louvre heist, at the famed museum with his mother and grandfather. When the trio arrived to find the museum closed, the stylish highschooler was unknowingly photographed by an AP journalist documenting the crime scene.\n \n\n   \n  What many online commentators had deemed a detective outfit is simply Pedro’s everyday look.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s important to dress classic. And I like to dress like that because I love history, especially the 20th century,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The young history buff has been embracing 40s-era fashion for almost a year now, he said. His obsession with the style began when he dressed as Jean Moulin, a hero of the French resistance during World War II, for carnival, a festive period celebrated in many countries ahead of Lent. Amid the parades and costumed festival-goers, he found a liking for the new look.\n \n\n   \n  “He realized the effect he had on other people,” his mother, Félicité Garzon Delvaux, explained. “Everyone looked impressed. Okay, something is happening there.”\n \n\n   \n  Since then, he has adopted the vintage style everywhere, even at school.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many of his classmates, Pedro does not own sweatpants. He is not, however, above reaching for the cargo pant on occasion.\n \n\n   \n  Good taste has long been a topic of discussion for the Garzon Delvaux family.\n \n\n   \n  Pedro’s mother, who brought him to the Louvre on that eventful day, grew up in Chartres, about 50 miles southwest of Paris, “in a museum” with an art curator for a mother and a prolific French storyteller for a father.\n \n\n   \n  In their home in Rambouillet, paintings, antiques and knick-knacks line walls and shelves in a manner reminiscent of an exhibition.\n \n\n   \n  “The beauty of things is always very important in our family,” Félicité affirmed.\n \n\n   \n  Due to her husband’s job as a diplomat, the family moved often, living in England, Spain, Bangladesh, and eastern France before returning to Rambouillet four years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the Pedro’s most striking pieces have been gathered from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  His vintage Soviet watch, for example, was bought in an antique store in Calcutta and repaired with parts that he sourced from Bulgaria with his father.\n \n\n   \n  His first tailored suit was commissioned at the age of 12 during a year spent in Bangladesh.\n \n\n   \n  Asked what he wants to do in the future, Pedro said he was interested in pursuing diplomacy like his father and paternal grandfather, or perhaps joining the military.\n \n\n   \n  The young man conceded that the uniforms may have something to do with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  But despite his carefully cultivated appearances, Pedro remains an enthusiastic young man of his own generation.\n \n\n   \n  When asked if his friends at school appreciate his style, he was quick to respond.  “Yeah, I think I have a lot of aura.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/uk/bbc-leaders-resign-amid-scandal-over-trump-speech-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"08:04:00-04:00","title":"BBC Leaders Resign Amid Scandal Over Misleading Edit of Trump Speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two senior BBC leaders, Director General Tim Davie and News Division CEO Deborah Turness, resigned amid a major scandal involving the misleading editing of a Donald Trump speech from January 6, 2021.

\n\n   \n  The BBC’s most senior executive, director general Tim Davie, and the chief executive of the news division, Deborah Turness, both quit after the leak of a deeply critical memo that, among other things, revealed that the BBC had misleadingly edited a  speech  by US President Donald Trump to make it appear that he had directly called for violence on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In a note to staff on Sunday afternoon, Davie said his resignation was “entirely my decision.” He added that as director general, he took “ultimate responsibility” for mistakes made by the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  Turness said the controversy over a documentary made by the BBC’s “Panorama” series had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.”\n \n\n   \n  “The buck stops with me,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Samir Shah, chair of the BBC, on Monday apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over the way Trump’s speech was edited.\n \n\n   \n  The resignations come after the Telegraph newspaper published details of a leaked internal BBC dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on editorial standards and guidelines.\n \n\n   \n  In an internal whistleblowing memo, Prescott revealed that last year the BBC had broadcast a “doctored” Trump speech, making it seem that the president had encouraged Capitol Hill rioters, telling them he was going to walk with them to “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Trump said in his speech in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, that “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump welcomed the news of the resignations and thanked the Telegraph for “exposing” corruption,

Everything you might have missed from NFL Week 10 \n       \n  By Jacob Lev, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:52 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the days grow shorter and darkness comes on quicker, the  NFL  season continues with a pivotal Week 10 delivering the same madness to which fans are accustomed.\n \n\n   \n  The week was more eventful than usual, starting with the NFL trade deadline that was highlighted by the New York Jets making headlines after a shocking fire sale that saw Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams find new homes in Indianapolis and Dallas respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday got started bright and early with Jonathan Taylor leading the Colts to an overtime win over the Atlanta Falcons in Germany, which led right into multiple teams in the bottom of the standings finding a way to secure victories.\n \n\n   \n  It also saw the New England Patriots officially commandeer their spot among the league’s elite and many blowouts in the late-game slate, including an appearance from President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you may have missed on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    Colts run all over Falcons in Germany\n \n\n   \n  The NFL’s penultimate international game of the season took place at Berlin’s Olympiastadion and delivered one of the best games of the season.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor powered the Colts to a 31-25 overtime victory over the Falcons in the first regular-season NFL game in the German capital.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old rushed for 244 yards and three touchdowns, becoming just the fourth player in league history to record at least 200 rushing yards and three rushing scores in a game twice in his career, joining Jim Brown, Adrian Peterson and Derrick Henry.\n \n\n   \n  An 83-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter put the Colts ahead 22-17, but Atlanta answered with a one-yard touchdown from Tyler Allgeier to retake the lead with just over a minute left. Colts quarterback Daniel Jones then led an eight-play drive, setting up Michael Badgley’s 44-yard field goal to force overtime.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor sealed the win for Indianapolis with a walk-off eight-yard touchdown in overtime, moving the Colts to an AFC South-best 8-2 record while the Falcons dropped to 3-6.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Commanders and Miami Dolphins will close out the international slate on November 16 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.\n \n\n   \n    The week of the upset\n \n\n   \n  The Jets, New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins haven’t had much to celebrate this season.\n \n\n   \n  But on Sunday, all three teams managed to pick up a victory.\n \n\n   \n  The Jets secured their first win of the season two weeks ago against the Cincinnati Bengals and were well-rested coming off their their bye week.\n \n\n   \n  Riding that momentum, the Aaron Glenn-led squad faced the other Ohio-based team – the Cleveland Browns – and won 27-20 for their second consecutive win.\n \n\n   \n  Special teams played the hero for Gang Green, scoring touchdowns on a kickoff return and a punt return with running back Breece Hall’s 42-yard receiving touchdown to cap it all off. Both teams are now 2-7. The Jets will look for their first three-game win streak since 2023 when they face the Patriots on Thursday Night Football next week.\n \n\n   \n  Questions are swirling throughout the NFL about the futures of head coach Mike McDaniel and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa after the firing of general manager Chris Grier a week ago.\n \n\n   \n  And a tough task was on hand for the Fins, facing the Buffalo Bills – a team that Miami had lost to seven-straight time entering the game at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The Fins blew out Buffalo 30-13 to snap the losing streak to their divison rivals and easing any qualms – at least for now.\n \n\n   \n  The Saints turned to their rookie, second-round pick Tyler Shough, against division rivals Carolina Panthers and did he deliver.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old, out of Louisville, threw for 282 yards and two touchdowns in their 17-7 win to improve to 2-8 on the season.\n \n\n   \n    Patriots are back. Are they here to stay?\n \n\n   \n  Times were tough for the Patriots in the years following the departure of Tom Brady and Bill Bellichick.\n \n\n   \n  With Mike Vrabel returning to Foxborough as head coach—a place where he won multiple Super Bowls as a player—and rookie quarterback Drake Maye emerging as the franchise leader they hoped for, New England has reestablished itself among the league’s elite teams.\n \n\n   \n  The Pats marched into Tampa Bay and defeated Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers 28-23 as Maye passed for two touchdowns and rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson rushed for two more on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  After a 4-13 record last season, New England finds themselves with a 8-2 record and an AFC East division lead.\n \n\n   \n    A late-game slate filled with blowouts and the president\n \n\n   \n  All the excitement fans were presented with earlier in the day was completely wiped up by the three-game late slate, which all featured blowouts.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump became the first sitting president to attend a regular-season NFL game since President Jimmy Carter when he arrived Sunday at Northwest Stadium in Maryland for the  Washington Commanders  game against the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  While the President was met with boos, so were the Commanders as they were crushed 44-22 by the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  Sam Darnold is yet again proving why he is one of the most underrated quarterbacks in the league after leading the Seattle Seahawks to a 44-22 win over the Arizona Cardinals.\n \n\n   \n  The former first round pick 178 yards and a touchdown while defensive lineman DeMarcus Lawrence returned two fumbles for touchdowns in the win. Seahawks find themselves in a race for the NFC West division with the Los Angeles Rams, who also won Sunday in convincing fashion.\n \n\n   \n  Matt Stafford threw for four touchdowns in the team’s 42-26 win over the short-handed San Francisco 49ers.\n \n\n   \n  Both teams find themselves with a 7-2 record with seven games remaining.\n \n\n   \n  There is still one game to go in the week with the reigning Super Bowl champions Philadelphia Eagles visiting Titletown, USA, to face the Green Bay Packers on Monday Night Football.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/democrats-voting-government-shutdown-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"08:01:00-05:00","title":"Democrats Vote with Republicans to End Government Shutdown, Securing ACA Subsidy Vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan effort involving several Democrats and one independent senator—Angus King—secured a vote to end a 40-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history.

on the government shutdown deal? \n       \n  By David Wright, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:01 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A group of Democrats and one Democratic-aligned independent have helped clinch an agreement to  end the government shutdown , saying they had secured a vote on the Affordable Care Act subsidies at the center of the standoff.\n \n\n   \n  The negotiators argued that Republicans’ “flat refusal” to move on Democrats’ earlier proposals made clear that “this is the best possible offer we could secure.”\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at some of those members, and their rationale for ending the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Four of them are former governors of their home states and none are up for reelection in next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois\n \n\n   \n  Durbin, a veteran member of Democratic leadership retiring at the end of his term, broke with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who opposes the deal.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Durbin said that “this bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown’s hurt.”\n \n\n   \n  He underscored the cost of the disruptions caused by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “For 40 days—the longest shutdown in U.S. history—federal workers went without paychecks. This includes our air traffic controllers, whose towers were already understaffed. They continued to work 10 hours days, six days per week to keep our airspace safe, with this additional stress at a life-saving job,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Angus King of Maine\n \n\n   \n  King, an independent, was just elected to a third term in 2024. While he caucuses with the Democrats, King has a penchant for bipartisan dealmaking and was also among the key negotiators expressing alarm about the consequences of the ongoing shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “The question was, is, as the shutdown progresses, is a solution on the ACA becoming any more likely? It appears not,” King said Sunday. “I think people are saying we’re not going to get what we want, although we still have a chance – because part of the deal is a vote on the ACA subsidies – but in the meantime, a lot of people are being hurt.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia\n \n\n   \n  Kaine was also elected to a third term in 2024. The former governor pointed to both ACA subsidies and efforts to defend the federal workforce, a key pressure point in his state, home to roughly 300,000 employees.\n \n\n   \n  “I have long said that to earn my vote, we need to be on a path toward fixing Republicans’ health care mess and to protect the federal workforce,” Kaine said in a statement about the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Kaine said the deal “guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits,” and also that it “will protect federal workers from baseless firings, reinstate those who have been wrongfully terminated during the shutdown, and ensure federal workers receive back pay.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman, elected to the Senate in 2022, has been breaking with Democrats and voting for the House-passed short-term funding resolution. He said that the shutdown “has more than run its course.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we have the votes, it’s probably going to be the minimum if it does,” he warned.\n \n\n   \n  “Our party could be overplaying its hand,” he added. “I don’t think much anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen has announced she would not seek reelection in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Sunday, Shaheen said that “waiting longer will only prolong the pain Americans are feeling because of the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be clear: This is a major step that was not predetermined. I have spent years as the lead sponsor of this legislation. There is no one in the Senate who wants to see these tax credits extended more than me. But weeks of negotiations with Republicans have made clear that they will not address health care as part of shutdown talks,” Shaheen said.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire\n \n\n   \n  Hassan, another former governor, won reelection in 2022 to her swing-state seat. She told reporters that she had been hearing from residents both affected by looming spikes in health care costs and by people affected by the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Our work to deliver relief for families now enters an important phase,” she said. “Congress has one month to engage in serious bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act’s expiring tax cuts that help people afford their health insurance.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada\n \n\n   \n  Cortez Masto also voted to end the shutdown. Her term expires in 2028.\n \n\n   \n  “Too many Americans, hardworking individuals, seniors, children were suffering,” she said at a press conference, adding that she was seeing lines at food banks that rivaled the need during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  “We can open the government and we can still fight to address this looming health care crisis,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada\n \n\n   \n  Rosen, the other Democrat from Nevada, joined her colleague in voting to end the shutdown. She was reelected last year.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, it’s become clear as we go deeper into the second month of this Republican government shutdown that President Trump and Washington Republicans are weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt,” Rosen said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What opponents are saying\n \n\n   \n  Many prominent members of the Democratic caucus opposed the deal and voiced ongoing concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m voting no on the continuing resolution that would double healthcare premiums for 20 million Americans, kick 15 million people off Medicaid & allow 50,000 Americans to die unnecessarily every year. All to give $1 trillion in tax breaks for billionaires,” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote on social media, live-streaming a speech opposing the deal.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, who is eying a 2028 presidential bid, also said he was a firm “no.”\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a phrase in Spanish, ‘Con salud, lo hay todo; sin salud, no hay nada.’ It means ‘With good health you have it all; without your health, you have nothing.’ It’s with that phrase in mind that I stand firm in my decision to vote no so that families across the country can get the health care they need,” Gallego said in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/flight-cancellation-government-shutdown-options","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"07:29:00-05:00","title":"Flight Cancellations Rise as People Turn to Cars, Buses, and Creative Solutions Amid Ongoing Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has led to over 1,000 flight cancellations, severely disrupting travel plans for thousands of citizens.

their destinations \n       \n  By Alaa Elassar, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:29 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Xavier Vega and his partner, Soluna Vega, cheered in relief as the “Welcome to Connecticut” sign came into view. It marked the end of an unplanned 17-hour highway odyssey home after their flight became one of more than 1,000 cancellations on Saturday alone tied to the ongoing   government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who had to take a train, bus and a rental car   on Saturday   to drive over 1,100 miles from Florida, are among thousands of travelers whose plans have been   derailed by the widespread cancellations – and are searching   for other ways to get where they’re going.\n \n\n   \n  Rental car companies have been flooded with one-way bookings. Avis, Hertz and Turo all reported sharp increases in demand as passengers scrambled to make it to their destinations by any means necessary.\n \n\n   \n  An end to the travel woes could be in sight, with Senate lawmakers  voting on a key step  toward reopening the government Sunday night – but until then,  frustrated passengers continue to face flight delays and cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  For some like the Vegas, the disruptions have meant resorting to long drives, costly rebookings and days of uncertainty, all ripple effects of a shutdown that continues to grind the nation’s air system to a halt.\n \n\n   \n    The marathon to find their way home\n \n\n   \n  Exhausted and running on little sleep, Xavier and Soluna Vega set out on a 1,390-mile dash from Daytona Beach, Florida, to Connecticut, rushing to make it home on time for work Monday after spending $900 on a rental car – just two of countless travelers forced into marathon drives by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The nightmare began with what initially was a four-hour delay.\n \n\n   \n  “Our (Saturday) flight went from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., to 8 p.m. to 11:45 p.m., and we just felt so hopeless,” Xavier Vega told CNN from their rental car on Sunday while his partner drove.\n \n\n   \n  The couple had disembarked from a cruise in Miami with their best friend and took a train to Orlando, only to face a nearly 10-hour flight delay that ended in cancellation. The situation continued to worsen; a music festival in Orlando had wiped the city’s supply of rental cars. Desperate to get home, they managed to hop on a bus, which they nearly missed, to Daytona Beach, scrambling for Plan C.\n \n\n   \n  But when they arrived, the situation was just as bleak; not a single rental car was available. Then, by sheer chance, a break came when they least expected it.\n \n\n   \n  “We got really lucky with a gentleman who happened to drop off his rental before his flight got canceled, so we ended up really cramped in a Kia Soul,” Vega said, remarkably positive for someone who’d just pulled an eight-hour overnight drive.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t have it any other way, I just wanted to get home.”\n \n\n   \n    From backup plan to the only option\n \n\n   \n  Sean and Kelsey Fishkind were just hours away from what should have been a perfect third anniversary: a romantic night at “The Phantom of the Opera” in Baltimore. But two days ago, their celebration nearly fell apart.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the couple was en route from Boston to Washington, DC, when  their flight from their layover in New York’s LaGuardia Airport was abruptly canceled, and the next available option wasn’t until the following afternoon. But with the real possibility even that flight could be delayed or scrapped, the Fishkinds realized they’d have to find a backup plan, fast.\n \n\n   \n  At around 11 p.m., the couple says their only solution was a rental car, but finding one was easier said than done.\n \n\n   \n  According to Hertz, one-way rental bookings over the weekend surged 20% compared to the same period last year, and Turo reported a 30% jump in rentals on Friday alone.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen an increase in one-way rental activity as airlines adjust flight schedules and travelers explore alternative ways to reach their destinations,” an Avis spokesperson told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Fishkinds were among the lucky ones, managing to secure a vehicle just in time for the four-and-a-half-hour drive to DC.\n \n\n   \n  But securing a rental car was the beginning of their ordeal. The couple says Delta Air Lines had assured them they’d be reimbursed for the car rental, but after hours of frustrating calls and multiple claims, they tell CNN they’re still left with no clear answers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Delta for comment regarding the incident and car rental reimbursement in cases related to the ongoing cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  Delta said  in an earlier a statement  to customers that expense reimbursements aren’t available “for flights that are delayed or canceled due to adverse weather events or other circumstances outside of Delta’s control, including without limitation for hotels, rental cars, meals, ground transportation and other pre-paid expenses.”\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Transportation has said while airlines are  required to issue full refunds , “they will not be required to cover secondary costs,” which is the usual procedure when a cancellation or delay isn’t the carrier’s fault.\n \n\n   \n  For Sean Fishkind, a Federal Communications Commission employee furloughed due to the shutdown and without a paycheck for over 40 days, the stress is compounded.\n \n\n   \n  “From my perspective, with the impact it has on employees and the impact it has on the public, because I can’t do my job to serve the public, this is just another reminder of the more direct ways it’s starting to impact people,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It kind of feels like they’re not doing the things they need to to try to come to a resolution.”   \n \n\n   \n    Patience and kindness go a long way, travelers say\n \n\n   \n  Despite the frustration and chaos, many travelers are navigating   the shutdown’s stress with unexpected kindness.\n \n\n   \n  “We were on the appreciative side,” said Xavier Vega, a former TSA worker of 10 years who was on the front line during the 2018-2019 government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of times working for TSA, people hated us. But during the shutdown, people actually had empathy and were willing to help us,” he said. “They would give us Starbucks gift cards to get a coffee to kind of brighten up our days a little bit.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, Vega works at a group home for people with schizophrenia, many of whom lost their SNAP food aid benefits when the ongoing   shutdown froze funding from the US Department of Agriculture.   The situation remains tense. On Saturday, the US Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration  to pause full SNAP food aid benefits  for now, leaving recipients once again scrambling to make ends meet.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very difficult to tell them, ‘Hey, you might not be eating this month.’ That also added into the understanding portion of it, because I’m experiencing it as someone who has mouths to feed,” Vega said.\n \n\n   \n  He added he also worried about travelers who don’t have the same flexibility or privilege when travel plans fall apart.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m thinking, there was a gentleman in a wheelchair at the airport,” Vega said. “How is he going to get home? He’s reliant on the certainty that his flight will get there on time, that his pickup (driver) from t﻿he airport will be there at the time he says he’s going to be there.”\n \n\n   \n  For David Tilden, the shutdown turned a birthday getaway into a logistical nightmare. After an eight-hour delay at LaGuardia and a last-minute cancellation at 11 p.m., Tilden told CNN he and his wife rented a car and endured a 14-hour drive back to Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  Tilden says he thinks the crisis isn’t just about politics—it’s about a lack of basic kindness, particularly from government systems.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe in the power of kindness and tenderness and love, and I believe in the conversation, and that’s gone in Washington. It’s disgusting, it’s traumatizing, and they should all be ashamed themselves,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A fundamental failure in the United States government’\n \n\n   \n  Although travelers are trying to stay optimistic, the outlook so far remains grim.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told CNN air travel could be “reduced to a trickle” as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches and airlines continue to implement FAA-mandated reductions in flights.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines will be   required to gradually increase those cuts over the next week, with Duffy warning flight reductions  could increase to 20%  if the shutdown doesn’t end soon.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Senate convened a rare Saturday session, though senators  did not vote  and there is no deal in sight on a potential funding compromise. Majority Leader John Thune said he intends to  keep the chamber in session  until a deal is reached and the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s happening in Washington is like two kids watching their parents fight every day because they hate each other,” said Tilden, adding the shutdown and its impact on Americans is a stark contradiction to the values of American democracy and unity.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not the United States of America. This is the divided States of America. They’re hypocritical when they stand up and chant USA,” Tilden said.\n \n\n   \n  For Vega, the focus, he says, should be on the people most affected — the vulnerable, like the residents he works with who struggle with mental health issues worsened by the sudden loss of SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think whatever is being argued in Washington right now is more important than people having food on the table or being able to get from point A to point B with some level of certainty,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But if the shutdown stretches into the holidays, Vega believes it will signal a far deeper crisis beyond canceled flights.\n \n\n   \n  “At that point, there has been a fundamental failure in the United States government, and we as citizens have to speak up on that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Manu Raju and   Gordon Ebanks contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/snap-benefits-limbo-shutdown-court","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:48:00-04:00","title":"Appeals court rejects Trump admin effort to block full SNAP payments, but many recipients still in limbo","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a weeklong government shutdown, tens of millions of Americans relying on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) faced uncertainty over their food benefits.

payments, but many recipients still in limbo \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:48 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tens of millions of Americans who  rely on the nation’s largest federal food assistance program  have been caught in a weekslong swirl of Trump administration pronouncements, court orders and anxiety since the  US government shutdown  has called their ability to buy groceries into question.\n \n\n   \n  Some recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the program formerly known as food stamps, have received their full benefits this month, while others have only received a fraction of their usual allotment, while still others  remain in limbo , uncertain if or when their payments will arrive.\n \n\n   \n  In response, a group of Democratic-led states and a coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses have launched fast-moving legal challenges seeking to restore full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The fight over food benefits has become a central flashpoint between all three branches of government during the  historically long shutdown  as one of the clearest and most tangible ways the impasse is affecting Americans’ daily lives.\n \n\n   \n  While a  bipartisan Senate deal  has emerged to fund the government through January 30 and ensure SNAP benefits through fiscal year 2026, the successful procedural vote is only a first step. The measure must still pass the full Senate and the House before heading to the president’s desk.\n \n\n   \n  At stake is critical assistance nearly 42 million people rely on to  feed themselves and their families . On average, households receive about $350 a month in benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s where things stand:\n \n\n   \n    It is unclear when all SNAP recipients will get November benefits\n \n\n   \n  It is still unclear when all recipients will receive their full allotment for November.\n \n\n   \n  Much depends on when – and whether – Congress actually approves a short-term spending package to temporarily fund federal agencies and reopen the government, and whether President Donald Trump signs it, which could take several more days to play out.\n \n\n   \n  If the deal falls through and the government remains shuttered, exactly how SNAP gets funded in the short term will continue to play out in the courts.\n \n\n   \n  At issue now is a lower court ruling ordering the US Department of Agriculture – which administers SNAP funds on the federal level – to swiftly issue full food stamp benefits to all recipients. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily halted the lower court ruling on Friday evening to allow the appeal to play out.\n \n\n   \n  Late Sunday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals declined a request by the Trump administration to block the lower court ruling, but the ruling has no immediate effect because Jackson’s temporary hold remains in place.\n \n\n   \n  Even after funding is decided and the USDA directs states to provide enrollees with their usual allotment, the timing of the benefits arriving will depend on the state: Some will be able to act immediately, while others may need more time.\n \n\n   \n    Some states have already issued partial or full benefits\n \n\n   \n  After a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the USDA to pay full SNAP benefits – and the agency issued guidance on Friday saying it was complying – several states rushed to distribute to recipients their full November allotment.\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Kansas, New York, Massachusetts, California, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington and Oregon are among the states to issue full SNAP benefits to at least some of their residents in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  Several states have said they will not seek to undo those distributions, as ordered Saturday by the USDA. The states argue they issued the full benefits before Jackson’s pause.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina, meanwhile, issued partial benefits to recipients on Friday but has halted further action in light of Jackson’s stay.\n \n\n   \n    A weekslong series of court orders put millions in benefit limbo\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of the turmoil is whether the USDA must pay full SNAP benefits without new funding from Congress and if courts can force the agency to fund the program during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the USDA said  it would not use  its roughly $5.3 billion contingency fund to provide at least partial payments for November. Full benefits for November are expected to total around $8.2 billion and other expenses push the total cost to nearly $9 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Lawsuits surfaced against the Trump administration, and on Halloween, two  federal judges rejected  the agency’s claim the contingency fund was untouchable and said the administration was required to tap into billions of those dollars to at least partially cover food stamp benefits in November.\n \n\n   \n  Days after the administration  committed to providing 50%  – and  then 65%  – of the maximum allotments at the order of a federal judge in Rhode Island, the judge then said the government must immediately pivot to  fully cover SNAP  for tens of millions of Americans because some states might not be able to send partial payments for weeks or even months.\n \n\n   \n  “People have gone without for too long,” US District Judge John McConnell said during a hastily called hearing Thursday. “Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, the Trump administration filed an appeal seeking to stay McConnell’s decision. Still, the USDA announced Friday it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with McConnell’s order.\n \n\n   \n  That evening, Jackson granted the administration’s request for a temporary pause, saying the government did not have to immediately transfer additional funds to provide full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s order does not resolve the underlying legal questions raised by the case – and the Trump administration has already committed to using the program’s contingency fund to partially pay benefits. Rather, Jackson’s administrative stay freezes any additional action by the administration to give an appeals court additional time to review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Following the justice’s order, the USDA ordered states to  stop issuing full food stamp benefits  for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments. In the  Saturday directive , the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  States failing to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over-issuances of benefits, the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly one in eight Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole and Gordon Ebanks contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/asia/malaysia-thailand-migrant-boat-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"03:02:00-05:00","title":"Near dozen dead in Thai-Malaysia search after Rohingya migrant boat sinks","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A boat carrying Rohingya migrants from Myanmar sank near the Thailand-Malaysia border, resulting in 11 confirmed deaths, with around 70 people believed to have been on board.

Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, Matt Stiles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:01 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has killed 76 people in 19 strikes that have destroyed 20 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN.

Hadar Goldin, an Israeli soldier killed more than a decade ago in Gaza, the Prime Minister’s Office said on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin was killed in the final days of the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas and his body has been held in Gaza since then.\n \n\n   \n  “We brought Lt. Hadar Goldin - our son, a fighter - to be buried in Israel,” his father, Simcha Goldin, said in a televised statement outside their home in Kfar Saba on Sunday evening. “We do not abandon soldiers on the battlefield, because this is a value and we don’t compromise on values. Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel.”\n \n\n   \n     Following the burial ceremony in Israel on Sunday, his mother, Leah Goldin, said, “The first is the value of friendship and comradeship, the second is the right to burial in Israel, and the third is human dignity. Sadly, we faced many disappointments. We cannot give up on who we are, and we will prevail through our values.”\n \n\n   \n  Goldin’s return “provides some measure of comfort to a family that has lived with agonizing uncertainty and doubt for over 11 years,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, “I know the anguish that his family has endured. I know the pain and the solidarity that have united the entire people of Israel. And today, we are united in the knowledge that we have finally brought him back to his parents and to his family.”\n \n\n   \n  As with previous hostage returns, Hamas handed what it said was Goldin’s body to the the International Red Cross, which then transferred it to the Israeli military. The handover was part of the ceasefire agreement that brought the worst of the fighting in Gaza to an end a month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin’s family has spent years campaigning for his return, citing Israel’s commitment to the principle of leaving no one behind in conflict. The international campaign for the return of hostages taken during the Hamas-led terror attack on October 7, 2023, put a new spotlight on their fight.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin was killed on August 1, 2014, just as a ceasefire went into effect to end the conflict and just days before Israel withdrew its troops from Gaza. The Israeli military had activated the so-called Hannibal Directive, a controversial order that enables Israeli troops to take extraordinary measures to prevent a kidnapping, even at the risk of harming the abducted. Goldin’s abduction led to massive Israeli strikes in Rafah. He was 23 years old, one of 68 Israeli soldiers killed during the month-and-a-half-long war.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in that war, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire, Hamas was required to return all hostages, including the bodies of those who had been killed.\n \n\n   \n   Israeli intelligence has previously assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The return of Goldin’s body leaves four deceased hostages still in Gaza. Three are Israelis who were killed on October 7, 2023, and whose bodies were taken to Gaza. The fourth is a Thai citizen who was kidnapped during the attack. The Thai government said in May 2024 that he was presumed dead.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/asia/south-korea-yoon-suk-yeol-charges-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:14:00-05:00","title":"South Korea special prosecutor indicts former President Yoon on charges of aiding an enemy state","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korea’s special prosecutor has indicted former President Yoon Suk Yeol, former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, and former military intelligence chief Yeo In-hyung on charges of aiding an enemy state and abusing power, stemming from their alleged efforts to provoke a military conflict with North Korea in 2024.

\n       \n  By Wayne Chang, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:04 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Louvre’s “Mona Lisa,” the British Museum’s Rosetta Stone, MoMA’s “Starry Night” — major museums often have one must-see item that singlehandedly draws visitors from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  For the National Palace Museum, in Taiwan’s capital Taipei, the star attraction is somewhat humbler: a cabbage.\n \n\n   \n  Carved from a block of white and green jadeite, the remarkably realistic sculpture of a Chinese cabbage glistens as if freshly picked from a field, still wet with morning dew. A katydid and locust lurk in its verdant leaves, while the unknown sculptor used the material’s natural flaws to create the illusion of ribs running along its stems.\n \n\n   \n  Resting gently on a wooden stand, the carving is just 7.4 inches tall. But it is so popular that it occupies its own exhibition hall. The museum even publicizes which dates the object will be away on “business trips” — in other words, when it is on loan or exhibited elsewhere — so visitors are not left disappointed.\n \n\n   \n  The museum does not record how many of its approximately 2 million annual visitors come specifically to view the Jadeite Cabbage. But the long line of people waiting to snap photos suggests that many, if not most, of them do. “When you see it in pictures, it doesn’t seem that vivid, but when you see it here in true light, it’s really more attractive,” said Chloe Wang, a tourist from mainland China, during a recent trip to the museum.\n \n\n   \n  The cabbage’s popularity often sees it dubbed a “national treasure” of Taiwan, although the sculpture is not officially designated as such. Its image is pasted across merchandise and turned into plush toys and replica models, in the museum store and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  The Jadeite Cabbage, like most of the National Palace Museum’s collection, is an imperial relic once housed at the Forbidden City in Beijing before being relocated to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. It is, by no means, the only one: Beijing’s Palace Museum and the Tianjin Museum, also in mainland China, both have cabbages carved from jade. In fact, the Taiwan museum itself even has two other examples.\n \n\n   \n  So why did this one, also known as “Jadeite Cabbage with Insects,” achieve global fame?\n \n\n   \n  Hsu Ya-hwei, an art history professor at National Taiwan University, said the jade’s shimmering colors and the sculptor’s technique help the piece stand out. “The craftsmanship, combined with this particular piece of the material, produced a good result,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the cabbage’s enduring popularity may also come down to its perceived symbolism. Possibly part of a dowry paid to China’s Guangxu Emperor by a consort in the 1880s, the artifact has long been associated with female purity, fertility and abundance. While some historians have questioned the long-held belief that the locust and katydid represent children — and whether the item was even a dowry gift — the idea nonetheless grabbed people’s imaginations, said Hsu.\n \n\n   \n  “The auspicious wishes contained in the artifact are quite important, and probably a key factor in its appeal to ordinary visitors,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Few historical clues\n \n\n   \n  After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Jadeite Cabbage was discovered sitting in a colorful enamel pot in the Forbidden City. It later went on show at Beijing’s Palace Museum, which was opened by China’s Republican government to display the vast imperial collection. Curators opted to present the cabbage without its pot, to make it more visually appealing, and it was an instant success with the public after﻿ debuting in 1928.\n \n\n   \n  In the 1930s, amid fears the palace collection would be seized by Japan’s Imperial Army, many of the treasures were evacuated to other cities and spent years on the road, sometimes hidden in temples and caves on the way. After Communist leader Mao Zedong triumphed in the Chinese Civil War, the fleeing Republican forces shipped thousands of crates of artifacts to Taiwan, where they established a new seat for their government.\n \n\n   \n  The Jadeite Cabbage was among the almost 700,000 items now forming the collection of Taipei’s National Palace Museum, which opened at its current location in 1965. Three years later, Taiwan’s national postal service issued a  stamp  featuring the cabbage’s image that was printed 3.5 million times, further cementing it in the public imagination.\n \n\n   \n  The cabbage is often referred to as one of the institution’s “three treasures,” along with two other popular artifacts — namely the Meat-Shaped Stone, a piece of jasper carved to resemble braised pork belly, and the Mao Kung Ting, a traditional cooking vessel featuring the longest known inscription of ancient characters on any item of Chinese bronzeware.  ﻿ The trio are often collectively described as “pickled cabbage pork hotpot” by tour guides and as a marketing gimmick.\n \n\n   \n  The everydayness of these items may also hold clues to their draw. “The familiar and endearing image of the cabbage instantly creates a connection to the imperial court, which can sometimes feel quite distant and foreign,” wrote Wang Shao-chun, a former researcher with the museum’s antiquities division, in a museum journal ﻿earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, despite the Jadeite Cabbage’s popularity among the public, some art historians and museum curators are unfazed. To trained eyes, it is of similar quality to many other realistic jade carvings, which were quite prevalent in the Qing dynasty.\n \n\n   \n  “It is one of the most unique, but not the only great piece of Chinese craftsmanship,” wrote Chang Li-tuan, a former researcher with the museum’s antiquities division, in the aforementioned﻿ museum journal.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers also say the lack of written records about the artifact — including information on who commissioned, crafted and owned it — leave the item’s historical context largely unknown.\n \n\n   \n  “There are few historical clues about the piece that allow us to talk about it in-depth,” Hsu said. “Or at least, they have not yet been found.”\n \n\n   \n  This may be why Taiwan’s Ministry of Culture has only designated the cabbage a “significant antiquity,” rather than a full-fledged National Treasure.\n \n\n   \n  “Its popularity and its historical value are clearly unproportional,” Wang told CNN. “Just like movies, a blockbuster may not necessarily be a masterpiece, and vice versa.”\n \n\n   \n  For museum curators, Wang added, the Jadeite Cabbage’s fame is a double-edged sword. “We work hard to promote other great exhibits, but sometimes the only thing on people’s minds is the cabbage. It’s kind of like a singer only remembered for that one hit song.”\n \n\n   \n    Celebrating its centennial\n \n\n   \n  The museum attaches high importance to the security of its most prized artifacts. The Jadeite Cabbage is displayed in a reinforced glass cabinet and held in place by tight strings to protect it from sudden movements — an ever-present threat in earthquake-prone Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  When it travels, it is placed in a dedicated container, which in turn is placed in a wooden box filled with protective packaging. Police and dedicated museum staff typically escort the cabbage to the airport.\n \n\n   \n  It is, however, seldom lent to overseas museums. Prior to this year, the last time the item traveled abroad was in 2014, when it (and the Meat-Shaped Stone) was exhibited in Japan. But loans can sometimes serve as tools of diplomacy. In August, as Taiwan celebrates 100 years since the Palace Museum opened, the Jadeite Cabbage was sent, along with more than 130 artifacts, to the Czech Republic, whose ties with Taiwan have warmed — as its relations with China have deteriorated — in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s ruling Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its own territory despite never having ruled over it, criticized Taipei for engaging in “separatist maneuvers” by facilitating the Czech exhibition, which is on show in the capital Prague through December 31. Taiwanese government and museum   officials rejected the accusation, calling it simply a “cultural exchange.”\n \n\n   \n  In late September, Taiwan’s government said it had received an anonymous email threatening “arson, theft, shootings or terror attacks” if the exhibition continues. In a statement, the National Palace Museum said it was working with Czech authorities to enhance security.\n \n\n   \n  The exhibition remains open, with the Jadeite Cabbage proving to attract Czech visitors.\n \n\n   \n  “It dates from the late 19th century. But it is a perfect example of the highest artistry achievable with jade,” the show’s curator, Ondřej Crhák, told Radio Prague International in September, calling the loan “a rare opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is its first appearance in Europe,” he added. “Given its importance to the National Palace Museum and to Chinese culture, that makes it truly unique.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/europe/ukraine-russia-power-attack-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"02:20:00.000Z","title":"Millions of Ukrainians Face Dark and Cold After One of Russia’s Largest Attacks on Energy Infrastructure","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, including power stations and gas facilities, across multiple regions including Kyiv, Poltava, and Dnipropetrovsk.

temperatures and darkness after a wave of Russian attacks against energy facilities caused widespread power outages across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian authorities have warned that the large scale of the damage means it will take time to restore energy flows. Electricity supplies across the country are being rationed – with people in the capital Kyiv set to be without power for 10-12 hours on Sunday, according to schedules published by energy companies.\n \n\n   \n  Svitlana Grynchuk, Ukraine’s energy minister, said the attack on Saturday was “one of the largest direct ballistic attacks on energy facilities” since the start of the war.\n \n\n   \n  She said that emergency power cuts were implemented across almost all regions to stabilise the network. “We then switched to hourly power cuts, so that consumers could more easily plan their activities around the outages,” Grynchuk said.\n \n\n   \n  The attack over the weekend came just as temperatures in Ukraine began to drop to single digits degrees Celsius. Russia has targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure on numerous occasions since it launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, usually stepping up attacks around this time of the year.\n \n\n   \n  These frequent disruptions have forced Ukrainians to adapt – diesel generators have become a common sight across the country and people have become accustomed to scheduling their lives around planned outages.\n \n\n   \n  Many families are now scheduling cooking and homework time around the power schedules, and elderly people not leaving their homes in fear of getting stuck without an access to the lift.\n \n\n   \n    Russia strikes when people are asleep\n \n\n   \n  Nine Ukrainian regions came under attack overnight into Saturday, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n \n\n   \n  At least 15 civilians have been killed by Russian strikes over the weekend, according to Ukrainian local authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed and 12 injured when a Russian drone struck a nine-story apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro.  Video captured  the moment the drone struck in the darkness.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s nothing here, just ordinary buildings,” said a woman who gave her name as Maia.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how I survived, because all the shrapnel flew onto the bed where I was sleeping,” said Larysa, another resident of the building.\n \n\n   \n  “We gathered quickly and started to go downstairs. People were screaming. You could already hear screams from the street,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Of the 45 missiles fired by Russia overnight Saturday, some of which were ballistic weapons, the Ukrainian air force said only nine had been intercepted. Some 450 drones were also launched.\n \n\n   \n  “26 missiles and 52 strike UAVs (drones) have been recorded hitting 25 locations,” it said, with many of the attacks occurring in the central regions of Poltava and Dnipropetrovsk as well as Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  “It is extremely difficult to counter ballistic and aero-ballistic missiles,” Zelensky said in his daily address later Saturday. “Only a few systems in the world are capable of intercepting such missiles effectively – and to protect our entire territory, we need far more of these systems and far more of the missiles for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian president said Kyiv was working with the US to purchase additional Patriot air defense systems, which have proved capable in intercepting Russian missiles.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has requested more help from allies to replenish its air defenses, as well as longer-range missiles to attack Russian energy and military facilities. Its request for US Tomahawk missiles was turned down by President Donald Trump last month.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s defense ministry said the strikes had come in response to Ukrainian attacks, and had included Kinzhal ballistic missiles and other weapons in strikes against “enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex and gas and energy facilities of Ukraine that supported their operations.”\n \n\n   \n  The frequent attacks on energy have seriously damaged Ukrainian gas production. Ukrainian officials have said they’ll have to turn to expensive imports of European gas to make up the shortfall.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the enemy’s plans, Ukraine will have light and heat this winter,” said energy minister Grynchuk.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian military and security services  have also stepped up  drone and missile attacks against Russian refineries and other infrastructure such as pipelines and pumping stations in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, Ukrainian drones carried out what one Russian official described as a “massive attack” on energy facilities in the Volgograd region, a frequent target of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  A substation was hit, according to Andrey Bocharov, the regional governor, who said power was restored several hours after the strike.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/climate/south-america-oil-gas-brazil-guyana-argentina-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Welcome to the planet’s newest oil frontier","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South America is emerging as a major new frontier for oil production, driven by significant discoveries in Brazil, Guyana, and Argentina.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Off Brazil’s northeastern coast, where the sediment-heavy water of the vast Amazon River tips out into the Atlantic, are two very different types of treasure. The first is an ecological gem: a 3,600 square-mile  deepwater coral reef  discovered less than a decade ago. The second treasure puts the first in immediate danger. Billions of barrels of oil may lie in the ancient sediments beneath the seabed, and licenses have just been approved to drill there.\n \n\n   \n  A few hundred miles north, off the coast of Guyana, companies are already pumping around 650,000 barrels of oil a day from a huge deep-water reservoir discovered in 2015. The find has transformed this rainforest-carpeted country into the planet’s newest petrostate and highest oil producer per capita.\n \n\n   \n  Several thousand miles inland to the south, the wide, dusty plains of western Argentina’s Vaca Muerta — “dead cow” in English — are dotted with oil wells. Fossil fuel production from this enormous shale deposit has boomed over the past decade, putting it on track to produce  more than a million barrels a day  by 2030, analysts predict.\n \n\n   \n  Welcome to South America’s new oil frontier. “It’s really incredible how fast and how much it’s expanding,” said Nicole Figueiredo de Oliveira, the executive director at environmental non-profit Arayara.\n \n\n   \n  Countries across the region are ramping up extraction but Brazil, Guyana and Argentina are at the forefront —  among the top five drivers  of global oil growth outside of OPEC, the group of major oil exporters.\n \n\n   \n  They are three very different countries: an economic behemoth with an  environment-championing president , a  biodiversity hotspot  with high rates of poverty and an  economically volatile  country led by a  chainsaw-wielding climate denier . Yet they are united in their quest to expand oil production, arguing it’s vital to their economic and social development.\n \n\n   \n  This new fossil fuel boom is happening just as the impacts of the climate crisis — driven by fossil fuels — are beginning to bite in ever more alarming ways. People in South America are dying in  fires ,  floods ,  storms  and  droughts  made longer and more catastrophic by climate change.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s role as  host of the COP30 climate conference , which is supposed to be a landmark summit where countries set out goals to radically reduce planet-heating pollution, adds a particular dissonance to this oil surge.\n \n\n   \n  But as global oil demand stays strong, and other, richer, countries show few signs of scaling back, their argument is: Why shouldn’t oil supply come from South America?\n \n\n   \n  The continent has a long history of fossil fuel extraction; it holds the  second-largest reserves of oil and gas  after the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  Yet it’s one of the few regions that didn’t take advantage of the oil boom at the beginning of this century due to political riskiness and an aversion to private investment, said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University. “But that is changing very significantly,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Recent discoveries have stirred excitement, especially as the oil in South America is typically cheaper than average — deepwater sources, in particular, tend to produce large amounts at lower cost — and it also tends emit slightly lower levels of climate pollution per barrel, as it often requires less processing and is produced using newer infrastructure and cleaner energy.\n \n\n   \n  Huge oil companies including Exxon and Chevron have plowed in, seeing dollar signs in South America’s deep oceans and shale fields just as the US shale boom starts to plateau.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil is a superstar: the  region’s largest  oil and gas producer. Production has “reached levels that have never been seen in the region,” Monaldi said. This is in large part due to  ultra-deep “pre-salt” oil reserves  discovered in 2006 buried under thick layers of ancient salt beneath the ocean.\n \n\n   \n  Crude oil became the country’s top export in 2024 for the first time, overtaking soybeans, and there are hopes production will ramp up much further.\n \n\n   \n  In August, BP  announced  it had made its largest oil and gas discovery  in 25 years  off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Farther south, near Uruguay, oil companies hope the Pelotas Basin could be another new frontier.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the most controversial project is the one at the mouth of the Amazon River — the Foz do Amazonas basin — part of what’s known as the “Equatorial Margin,” a stretch of ocean along the northern coast of Brazil.\n \n\n   \n  In June, Brazil  auctioned off  several offshore oil blocks in the region, 19 of which are in the Amazon Basin, to companies including Chevron, Exxon and Brazil’s state-run oil company Petrobras.\n \n\n   \n  Petrobras has been trying to drill here for many years. In 2023, Brazil’s environmental agency IBAMA  denied  it an offshore drilling license, citing environmental concerns. But last month,   the agency gave the greenlight for exploratory drilling “after a rigorous environmental licensing process,” according to a  statement  from IBAMA.\n \n\n   \n  The agency’s task was to assess the “technical feasibility” of the project only, not the political or strategic side of oil exploitation, said a spokesperson for Brazil’s Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, which oversees IBAMA. Any process involving high-risk areas such as the Foz do Amazonas “must comply with the strictest technical, scientific, and environmental standards,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  The decision “is an achievement of Brazilian society,” said Magda Chambriard, president of Petrobras, in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  Environmental advocates are strongly opposed, arguing drilling in this ecologically delicate swath of ocean, with its unique reefs and huge stretches of mangrove forests, could bring catastrophic consequences.\n \n\n   \n  Ultra-deep water and strong currents mean any oil spill could quickly be swept across miles of ocean and coastline, and the remoteness of the drilling location from large settlements could delay clean-up operations, said Arayara’s Figueiredo de Oliveira.\n \n\n   \n  Approving drilling here mere weeks before the start of COP30 in the city of Belém — known as the gateway to the Amazon — presents tricky optics for Brazil, which is trying to walk a tightrope between environmental champion and fossil fuel power.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s mighty rivers and abundant rains mean  most of its electricity  comes from clean hydroelectric power. Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has presided over a  sharp decline in deforestation  and an increase in renewables.\n \n\n   \n  But Lula has always been pro-oil, Figueiredo de Oliveira said. He greeted Brazil’s big pre-salt discovery, made during his previous presidential term, with the words, “ God is Brazilian .” A famous photo shows him raising oil-drenched hands at a Petrobras event in 2010.\n \n\n   \n  Lula has firmly rejected claims of hypocrisy. “I don’t want to be an environmental leader. I never claimed to be,” he  said  at a COP30 meeting last week, adding it would be “irresponsible,” to quit oil.\n \n\n   \n  He argues oil wealth can help fund Brazil’s clean energy transition, although some fear the quest to become a major oil power will only delay it. “Every new discovery does set back the effort to move the world off fossil fuels; there’s a loss of momentum,” said Michael Ross, a political science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps Lula’s main narrative  is that oil revenues will provide a route to development and a pathway out of poverty, especially for the country’s poorer Amazon states. But Brazil is already a powerhouse “with many other economic opportunities,” Ross told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The argument oil is vital for development may be easier to make in a country like Guyana, where  around 48%  live on less than $5.50 a day, according to the World Bank.\n \n\n   \n  Guyana, which has a similar geology to Brazil’s Equatorial Margin, is experiencing a remarkable oil boom. The 2015 offshore   discovery “represents one of the most transformative milestones” in the country’s modern history, said President Irfaan Ali.\n \n\n   \n  It has transformed the nation of around 820,000 people into the  world’s fastest expanding economy . “We have never seen a country produce so many barrels per capita in the history of (the region)… they belong now in the category of the countries of the Middle East,” Monaldi said.\n \n\n   \n  The government has insisted it can balance oil exploitation with environmental priorities. Guyana is one of the few countries that stores more planet-heating pollution than it produces due to its vast rainforests. It also says that revenues will boost socioeconomic growth.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not see a contradiction between the responsible development of our oil and gas sector and our commitment to protecting the planet’s climate,” Ali told CNN. Both are “integral parts of a single national mission” to cut poverty, boost the economy and protect the environment, he said.\n \n\n   \n  But there are concerns Guyana could fall victim to the “resource curse,” in which huge windfalls can make life worse for those who live there. Venezuela, for example, holds the world’s largest proven oil reserves, and has descended into authoritarianism and economic crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Ali insists the resource curse “is not destiny” and oil wealth will translate into “benefits for every household.” Yet some residents say they face  sky- high living costs  they blame on oil development, and the country’s health outcomes remain below the regional average, according to the World Bank.\n \n\n   \n  South American oil is not just about deep water. Argentina’s huge shale region, Vaca Muerta, often compared to the Permian Basin in Texas, holds the world’s second largest reserves of shale gas and fourth largest of shale oil.\n \n\n   \n  It’s Argentina’s big hope for economic recovery under libertarian President Javier Milei. “Almost everything is about expanding Vaca Muerta,” said Gabriel Blanco, a professor in the Faculty of Engineering at the National University of Central Buenos Aires and former national director of climate change in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Oil and gas are a very easy sell domestically, Blanco told CNN. Climate change has “never ever” been on the public or political agenda, he said. Instead, “the narrative says that we are going to be rich and we’re going to develop.”\n \n\n   \n  Vaca Muerta is an attractive proposition for fossil fuel companies. Shale is a very different type of investment than deep-water drilling, Monaldi said. Companies can spend relatively small amounts to see if they can recover their money before putting in more. This encourages investment in Argentina, a country with “high political and regulatory risk,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But environmental experts fear the impacts of this booming shale field. Fossil fuels are extracted by “fracking,” a process that involves drilling into the Earth and injecting fluids at high pressure. “They use a lot of water, they use a lot of sand and chemicals, and so it’s a mess,” Blanco said.\n \n\n   \n  Exactly how South America’s oil future will unfold is not yet clear. New discoveries in Brazil may turn out to be less viable than hoped. For projects already drilling and pumping, reserves often run out earlier than anticipated, UCLA’s Ross said.\n \n\n   \n  Oil demand is also predicted to peak at the start of the next decade, which could mean countries that go hard on fossil fuels will find themselves locked into an unprofitable industry. “These countries are getting to the party right as the bar is closing,” Ross said.\n \n\n   \n  For now, however, demand remains. “While there’s still a gap between current production and demand, there will be investment into new projects,” said Flávio Ferreira Menten, an analyst at the research firm Rystad Energy.\n \n\n   \n  There are geopolitical considerations, too. If US oil production doesn’t keep growing, South America “becomes much more important,” Monaldi said, otherwise the world risks becoming reliant on countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  What’s happening in South America is reflective of something bigger, according to Blanco. The region’s love affair with fossil fuels is part of a global movement, he said: an implicit — and sometimes explicit — consensus that oil exploitation can and should continue for decades to come even in the face of a barreling climate crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like leaders decided to step strongly on the on the gas pedal and move forward with fossil fuels everywhere,” he said, “no matter what.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/democratic-unity-fractures-government-reopen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:05:00Z","title":"Democratic unity fractures, paving the way for the government to reopen","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After 40 days of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, a bipartisan compromise reached in the Senate allows for the reopening of federal operations through January 30, 2026.

Their move will offer relief to millions of Americans whose lives have been severely disrupted by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But the compromise was opposed by some key party leaders and is already igniting a firestorm of protests from progressives who accuse their more moderate colleagues of disastrously backing down, handing President Donald Trump a victory and turning their backs on millions of Americans who can’t afford  spiking health care premiums .  \n \n\n   \n  “I will not support a deal that does nothing to make health care more affordable,” Democratic Sen Elizabeth Warren, a leading progressive, wrote on X. “We are in a health care emergency. … A vote for this bill is a mistake.”\n \n\n   \n  It might be crass to parse the human misery caused by the shutdown for a partisan win after a political duel that deprived millions of Americans of  food benefits , left federal workers with $0 paychecks, and created chaos and safety fears in  commercial aviation .\n \n\n   \n  But the crisis — precipitated by the expiration of enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans,  whose prices are skyrocketing  — was fought for multilayered political reasons. It will influence judgments on Trump’s second presidency and the Republican majorities in Congress and help define the trajectory of the Democratic Party’s comeback bid ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  The deal sets a date for a vote in the Senate on ACA subsidies in December, but falls well short of cementing their extension. It funds the government through January 30 and guarantees pay for federal workers furloughed during the shutdown and those who worked without pay. It also reverses Trump’s firing of federal employees throughout the impasse and funds  food stamps  through 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Once the package works through procedural steps in the Senate, the Republican-led House must be recalled to vote on the measure.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘political disaster’\n \n\n   \n  The headline here is that sufficient numbers of Democrats are folding without achieving the goal that led them to withhold votes from a government funding bill and halt federal operations at the beginning of October.\n \n\n   \n  On the face of it, this looks like a massive failure. Democrats won no undertaking that Obamacare subsidies will be extended — despite insisting that such a move was their bottom line. The best they will get is a Senate vote. There is no guarantee that a bill extending subsidies will pass, considering the Senate’s GOP majority. And the prospects of the Republican House endorsing it seem even more remote.\n \n\n   \n  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive leader who sits as an independent but votes with Democrats, said the compromise risked “a policy and political disaster.” He added before the Senate vote: “My own thought is that it would be a horrific mistake to cave in to Trump right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Many leading Democrats  argued their party’s big wins  in elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City last week were attributable to the effective way their candidates lacerated Trump over  the cost of living .\n \n\n   \n  Now, at the first chance they got to put that lesson into practice — fighting for the affordability of health care — they gave up, even though polls showed most  voters blame Trump  for the shutdown and agree with the Democratic position.\n \n\n   \n  The blowback could be severe, exposing deep divisions in the party that may show the “big tent” that leaders kept citing in the aftermath of last week’s election victories may be more viable in theory than in practice.\n \n\n   \n  There were many unhappy Democrats inside and outside the Senate. Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego warned he would not turn his back on Americans seeing their premiums sharply rise as he voted no on the resolution. “At a time when prices are already too high, Americans are shopping for health insurance and experiencing such sticker shock that they are being forced to sign up for a crappy, overpriced plan or not signing up for insurance at all,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer, did not vote for the deal. But Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the party’s No. 2 leader in the chamber, who is retiring next year and is therefore shielded from a left-wing backlash, supported it.\n \n\n   \n  Another Democrat who voted for the deal, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, represents thousands of federal workers and welcomed the move to reverse firings during the shutdown. He also argued that the Senate vote on extending the enhanced subsidies would put the GOP on the spot. “Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don’t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,” Kaine said.\n \n\n   \n    A more pragmatic view of the Democratic concessions\n \n\n   \n  Still, assessments of the break in the deadlock that came on Day 40 of the shutdown must also factor in whether the Democrats’ demand was achievable in the first place and whether the deepening pain of the shutdown, which is fast becoming a national crisis, was about to make their position unsustainable.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat who opposed the shutdown all along, warned his party might overplay its hand by carrying on. “I don’t think much anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval,” Fetterman told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders, dealing with intense fury over Trump’s bulldozing presidency among their base, and disillusionment over the party’s disastrous 2024 election loss, had no real political option but to fight — even if it was obvious that securing an extension to Obamacare subsidies might be unattainable.\n \n\n   \n  The party may accrue some political benefits for forcing Trump into the longest-ever shutdown. Multiple polls showed more Americans blamed him and his party at a time when his  approval ratings  are dipping into the kind of steep slump second-term presidents struggle to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the shutdown, Trump, a billionaire surrounded by a Cabinet of millionaires and billionaires, seemed indifferent to the daily struggles of millions of Americans. It was easy for Democrats to portray him as cruel as his administration fought court orders to restore funding to food assistance for 42 million Americans. While Trump is pledging to talk more about affordability, that is an impression that might stick.\n \n\n   \n  And there is an unpalatable truth that some progressives prefer not to contemplate. Democrats have almost no power in Washington. They’ve used their only leverage — the capacity to withhold their votes in the Senate, where 60 votes are required for most legislation — to frustrate a president who gets almost no pushback. That’s not nothing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump seemed quite willing to allow the pain and anxiety of the shutdown to deepen for millions of Americans. He was implicitly daring Democrats to pick the suffering of one set of millions of Americans over the duress being experienced by millions more. With the president refusing to negotiate, it was incumbent on Democrats to consider whether the cost of carrying on was justified.\n \n\n   \n  Progressives are already dismayed about what many will see as a humiliating climbdown by Senate moderates. But another lesson from Democratic wins in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races last week was that moderate candidates racked up big victory margins. A pragmatic view of the shutdown as it stood on Sunday was that as the fast-worsening consequences became clear — with Thanksgiving travel chaos looming — Democrats may have risked losing their incremental political gains if public opinion swung against them as well as the GOP.\n \n\n   \n  In that sense, the classic building of pressure that historically ends up forcing the reopening of the government — namely that political damage caused by carrying on is outweighed by the advantage of staying shut down — did its work again, albeit belatedly.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, it’s become clear as we go deeper into the second month of this Republican government shutdown that President Trump and Washington Republicans are weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt,” Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said in a statement after voting to support the compromise deal.\n \n\n   \n  But whatever the recriminations, there’s no doubt Democrats succeeded in highlighting a core issue — the exploding cost of health care — which the GOP seems to have no viable plan to tackle.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown has not changed this issue: The health care system is broken, people may lose insurance, and Republicans may end up with the blame if they don’t fix it, since they are the party in power.\n \n\n   \n    Trump didn’t cave, but he may have badly damaged his brand anyway\n \n\n   \n  Given the exhausting pace of the Trump presidency, and the multiple controversies unfolding at once under the chaos agent in the White House, it seems unlikely a shutdown now will play a major role in influencing the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Trump may have gotten what he wanted.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout his presidency, business career and life, Trump has always tried to impose personal leverage. His self-image as a winner who doesn’t give into pressure will exit the shutdown intact. Trump was determined not bend to Democrats employing the kind of hardline tactics he so often uses himself. And he didn’t. The president warned that he wouldn’t negotiate on health care with the government closed. And he held firm.\n \n\n   \n  But the political cost wrought by his actions over the last 40 days could be considerable. He often looked callous, as though unconcerned about the real pain inflicted by the shutdown. After all, he went to the Supreme Court to try to overturn a court order requiring him to pay food stamp benefits. And when the deal was struck in the Senate on Sunday night, he was absent — after attending a Washington Commanders NFL game and spending the weekend at his luxury resort in Florida, reinforcing an impression he doesn’t care about the economic concerns of regular Americans.\n \n\n   \n  And Republicans are still not off the hook on the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. GOP leaders now face the question of whether they are willing to let them expire, in a scenario that could put health care out of reach for millions of people. This seems an unsustainable political position in the run-up to midterm elections, and the issue is set to only gain in traction as the end of the year looms.\n \n\n   \n  And bitter divisions in the GOP — most graphically exemplified during the shutdown by  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene , with her scathing criticism of her party’s dearth of ideas on health care — are likely to burst open when the House returns from its weekslong absence, and will again test the authority of Speaker Mike Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown drama also revealed rare signs that Trump’s authority over his own party isn’t absolute on Capitol Hill. Republican senators ignored his demands to  abolish the filibuster  that requires most bills to get 60 votes in the chamber. Such a move would have given Trump almost unlimited power to use GOP majorities to transform the nation over the next year.\n \n\n   \n  But GOP senators feared what any Democratic majority might do in the absence of the filibuster. Their position was a nod to a future in which Trump is not the dominant GOP figure, underscoring that lame-duck status may beckon even for a president who has shattered almost every convention of his office.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/asia/philippines-typhoon-fung-wong-uwan-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-05:00","title":"More than 1.4 million evacuated as second typhoon in a week slams into the Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong (known as Uwan locally) struck the Philippines in late November 2025, following the devastation caused by Typhoon Kalmaegi, killing at least four people, including two children, and displacing over 1.4 million residents.

     \n  By Laura Sharman, Caitlin Danaher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:26 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Typhoon Fung-wong triggered floods and landslides, cut power to entire provinces and killed at least ﻿four people, including two children, before barreling out of the Philippines on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan,   follows on the heels of  Typhoon Kalmaegi , which killed almost 200 people in the central part of the archipelago nation, as well as five people in Vietnam.    \n \n\n   \n  About 1.4 million people were evacuated ahead the typhoon making landfall on Sunday night, according to the Office of Civil Defense. Fung-wong slammed into the coastal municipality of Dinalungan, on the main island of Luzon, with sustained winds of up to 185 kph (115 mph) and gusts of up to 230 kph (143 mph).\n \n\n   \n  A mudslide buried a house and killed two children in the town of Kayapa in central Luzon, regional civil defense official Alvin Ayson told Reuters news agency Monday.\n \n\n   \n  They followed the deaths of   two people  —  one who   drowned in Catanduanes province and a woman who died after being trapped under the debris of a collapsed home in Catbalogan City, according to the civil defense.\n \n\n   \n  The storm, with a footprint that spanned nearly the entirety of the archipelago, lost strength as it swept through mountainous northern provinces and agricultural plains overnight, before heading into the South China Sea toward Taiwan, according to the Philippines’ weather agency PAGASA.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan is now bracing for Fung-wong, with school closures announced in parts of the eastern county of Hualien, and evacuation orders issued in flood and landslide-prone areas, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Dramatic video from the Philippines showed rescuers braving strong winds and homes submerged in water as recovery efforts continued overnight into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Drone footage from Reuters showed vast areas of flooded farmlands in Nueva Ecija province, while other videos showed massive waves crashing into the Catanduanes coastline, flooded streets, and water surging into a building in Aurora province, while families queued for food in shelters.\n \n\n   \n  About 1.4 million residents took emergency shelter at gymnasiums, theaters and relatives’ homes before the typhoon hit, with 318,000 remaining in evacuation centers on Monday, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “We could not sleep because of the winds hitting our metal sheets and tree branches falling,” Romeo Mariano, who sheltered with his grandmother at home in Isabela province, told Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  “When we got out to check our home, we saw the damage.”\n \n\n   \n  Filomina Mariano, a 69-year-old resident in Santiago City told Reuters: “I was not able to sleep last night. I told my grandchildren to pray for our safety. I was just sitting the whole night waiting for the storm to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  Around 1,000 houses were damaged in the storm, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) said, adding that some homes remain blocked by landslides and rescuers are working to reach them once conditions improve Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “While the typhoon has passed, its rains still pose a danger in certain areas in northern Luzon, including in metropolitan Manila,” Alejandro said. “We’ll undertake today rescue, relief and disaster-response operations.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 130 northern villages were flooded, with residents in at least one community trapped on their roofs as floodwaters rapidly rose, according to the Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  “People are a little shellshocked,” Butch Meily, president of the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF), told CNN, noting this marks the country’s fourth major typhoon, in addition to  two earthquakes , within the past seven weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Recovery efforts were interrupted in Kalmaegi-stricken Cebu and Davao to the south ﻿ , to concentrate all available resources on Fung-wong, including a 24-hour operation center near the capital Manila, said Meily of the PDRF, a major private-sector coordinator for disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  “But our funds are starting to get exhausted because of the number of emergencies,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  At its height, the typhoon’s massive circulation spanned 1,800 km — enough to cover the entire country, PAGASA weather specialist Benison Estareja told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared a state of emergency on Thursday due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected damage from Fung-wong.\n \n\n   \n  More than 325 domestic and 61 international flights were canceled over the weekend and into Monday, and more than 6,600 commuters and cargo workers were stranded in ports after the coast guard prohibited ships from venturing into rough seas, AP reported. About 3 million people were left without power on Sunday, according to Philippines News Agency.\n \n\n   \n  While the Philippines has not requested international aid after Kalmaegi, officials said the US and Japan are prepared to assist, and authorities have ordered schools and most government offices to close until Wednesday, according to AP.\n \n\n   \n    No pause for relief\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is no stranger to typhoons, and Fung-wong is the 21st named storm to impact the country this year, according to local officials.\n \n\n   \n  Its predecessor Kalmaegi left a trail of death and devastation as it tore through the central Philippines on Tuesday, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble and displacing tens of thousands of people. At least 188 people were killed, most in Cebu province, a tourist hotspot, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  Though not the strongest storm to hit the country this year, Kalmaegi was slow-moving and dumped huge volumes of water over highly populated areas. Officials said most people died from drowning.\n \n\n   \n  Its impact was worsened by clogged waterways in an already flood-prone area, and an apparent lack of understanding of early warnings, Alejandro of the Office of Civil Defense, told local media.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is one of Asia’s most flood-prone countries but this year it has also been mired in a massive corruption scandal involving flood control projects that have brought thousands of protesters onto the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of legislators, senators and construction companies have been accused of receiving kickbacks with money intended for thousands of flood control projects.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have  long warned  the human-caused climate crisis – for which industrialized nations bear greater historical responsibility – has only exacerbated the scale and intensity of regional storms that disproportionately impact populations in the Global South.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is one area where the weather is changing, with more intense storms and severe tropical storms with a wide rain band, Meily said.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past, we used to focus on where the storm would make landfall. But now we have to consider the rain band because it’s so wide in scope that areas far away from where the storm makes land are getting flooded.”\n \n\n   \n  The western Pacific is the most active tropical basin on Earth but global ocean temperatures have been at record levels for each of the last eight years.\n \n\n   \n  Hotter oceans, fueled by  human-caused global warming , provide ample energy for storms to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  The climate crisis is supercharging rainfall events as warmer air can hold more moisture, which it then wrings out over towns, cities and communities, as it already has this week in Southeast Asia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/us/coal-mine-flood-accident-west-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:28:00-05:00","title":"Flood Traps Miner in West Virginia Coal Mine","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A flood in the Rolling Thunder coal mine in West Virginia, near Drennen, has trapped a miner after a compromised old mine wall allowed water to enter.

client’s innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning,”   attorney Chris Georgalis told CNN in an email. “Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court.”\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s attorney, Michael J. Ferrara, also told CNN that his client is “innocent of all charges and looks forward to clearing his name in court.”\n \n\n   \n  “Emmanuel Clase has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win,” Ferrara added.\n \n\n   \n  Both players were placed on non-disciplinary leave during the 2025 MLB season in relation to a sports betting probe.\n \n\n   \n  “We are aware of the recent law enforcement action,” the Guardians tell CNN. “We will continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.”\n \n\n   \n  Major League Baseball says it has also been cooperating with the DOJ investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “MLB contacted federal law enforcement at the outset of its investigation and has fully cooperated throughout the process,” a league spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “We are aware of the indictment and today’s arrest, and our investigation is ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  The indictment alleges “the defendants agreed in advance with their co-conspirators on specific pitches that they would throw in MLB games. The co-conspirators then used that information to place hundreds of fraudulent bets on those pitches.”\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s involvement in the scheme is alleged to have started in 2023. The three-time All-Star coordinated with corrupt sports bettors to rig proposition bets on particular pitches he would throw, prosecutors say.\n \n\n   \n  The bettors would then wager on the speed and type of Clase’s pitches, based on information they received in advance from Clase, sometimes even during games, per the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ says bettors won at least $400,000 using inside information on Clase’s pitches.\n \n\n   \n  Ortiz is accused of joining the enterprise in 2025, working alongside Clase to coordinate with bettors on rigged pitches he would throw.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors allege Ortiz was paid a total of $12,000 to intentionally throw a ball instead of a strike in two MLB games. Clase allegedly received matching payments for his role in helping to arrange Ortiz’s rigged pitches, the feds say, with gamblers winning at least $60,000 in the process.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment, which was filed on Wednesday and unsealed Sunday, comes on the heels of a series of  similar indictments  involving Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones.\n \n\n   \n  The trio was arrested in October in relation to two separate federal gambling investigations, one involving rigged high-stakes poker games and the other involving insider trading in sports betting.\n \n\n   \n  Both the MLB and NBA cases are being handled by Nocella’s Brooklyn office.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted of all charges, Clase and Ortiz could potentially face decades behind bars.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Amanda Musa contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/government-shutdown-reopen-deal-senate","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"11:57:00-05:00","title":"Senate Advances Deal to Reopen Government After Centrist Democrats Strike Major Deal to End Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate advanced a bipartisan funding deal to end a 40-day government shutdown, with eight centrist Democratic senators supporting a temporary extension of funding through January 30, 2026.

deal to end shutdown \n       \n  By Manu Raju, Ted  Barrett, Alison Main, Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:57 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A critical bloc of eight Senate Democratic centrists on Sunday helped advance a funding deal to reopen the government in exchange for a future vote on extending  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies , putting Congress on a path to end the  longest shutdown in US history  within days.\n \n\n   \n  That deal would include a new stopgap measure to extend government funding until January and be tied to a larger package to fully fund several key agencies. It includes no guarantee from Republicans to extend the health care subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  What Democrats did secure is a future vote on the matter. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on the chamber floor Sunday that he will hold a vote on a measure to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits by the middle of next month. Democrats involved in the talks believe that will give enough time for House and Senate GOP leaders to negotiate a true compromise in the coming weeks, though it would be a major lift to get through a Republican-controlled Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the outrage from the rest of the Senate Democratic Caucus, GOP leaders are determined to move the funding measure quickly through Congress and to President Donald Trump’s desk in the coming days. Once Trump has signed it into law, it’s still not clear how quickly agencies can restore services for the tens of millions of Americans  facing shutdown pain , from the loss of federal food aid to child care closures to delayed paychecks. Senate GOP leaders have not yet scheduled a final passage vote.\n \n\n   \n  “I am optimistic that after almost six weeks of this shutdown, we’ll finally be able to end it,” Thune declared from the Senate floor on Day 40 of the funding lapse.\n \n\n   \n  An exasperated Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado voted no on the deal but argued that his colleagues who supported it did not “cave” and instead were doing “what they feel is helping the most number of people.”\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no good solution,” Hickenlooper said, adding that some of his colleagues believe Trump will “stop at nothing to prevent that subsidy from being restored.” He added: “I voted no just because … piss off, I’m just frustrated. We tried it and now we’re going to use every other tool. We’re not going to quit.”\n \n\n   \n  Once the Senate has given final approval to the funding measure, it heads to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson must muscle the deal through a fractious GOP conference — likely with help from Trump himself. It’s not yet clear how many House Democrats will help Johnson with that job.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government say Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending the Obamacare subsidies forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  They believe that Democrats have an upper hand on the issue of health care and that a separate health care vote will spotlight the differences between the two parties, even though it has little chance of becoming law. And they’re not ruling out another shutdown showdown in January, when the next tranche of funding expires (though critical programs such as food aid and WIC will already be funded, to lessen the pain for millions of Americans).\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a retiring Democrat from New Hampshire, said Republicans made clear repeatedly over recent months that “this was the only deal on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  “Now I understand that not all of my Democratic colleagues are satisfied with this agreement, but waiting another week or another month wouldn’t deliver a better outcome.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether Democrats would willing to vote down the next funding measure on January 30 if Congress fails to deliver a health care fix by then, Shaheen said: “That’s certainly an option that everybody will consider.”\n \n\n   \n  The deal, which has been in the works for the last five weeks, came together between three former governors — Shaheen of New Hampshire, Angus King of Maine and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire — along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House. Details of the deal were first reported by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One of those Democrats involved is Sen. Tim Kaine, who represents thousands of federal workers in Virginia and who said he supports the GOP’s promise for a future vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don’t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,” Kaine said of GOP senators who choose not to support extending the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  And importantly for Kaine, Democrats also secured an agreement from the White House to reverse its mass firings of federal workers during the shutdown, as well as protections against them happening the rest of this fiscal year. It also guarantees all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But inside the Democratic Party, the funding deal has exposed a deep divide. Liberal senators were fuming at their colleagues for backing the deal, with House Democratic leaders vowing to “fight” the deal in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democratic leadership was split on the vote, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opposing the deal while his No. 2, retiring Sen. Dick Durbin, supported it.\n \n\n   \n  But some liberal senators have fiercely opposed the plan, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s no deal without health care,” Blumenthal said, voicing a widespread sentiment in the Democratic caucus. “So far as I’m concerned, health care isn’t included, and so I’ll be a no.”\n \n\n   \n  Even some centrist-leaning Democrats, like Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, voiced concerns with the idea on Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  “I was involved for many weeks, and then over the last couple of weeks, it changed — last week it changed,” Slotkin said, noting that she was no longer involved in talks in recent days. “But I always said, like, it’s got to do something concrete on health care, and it’s hard to see how that happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Across the Capitol, House Democratic leaders sharply condemned the deal. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his caucus “will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” adding: “We will fight the GOP bill in the House of Representatives.”\n \n\n   \n  One member, Rep. Ro Khanna of California,  took to X  on Sunday night calling for Schumer to be replaced. “Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced. If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?” Khanna wrote.\n \n\n   \n  House Democrats plan to have their own caucus huddle on Monday, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture. That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The next step after Sunday night’s vote is a vote on the full measure, which includes the larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate would first vote to take up the House-passed stopgap measure, which means eight Democrats would need to support it for it to advance. Then, the Senate would amend that bill with the larger funding package negotiated between the two parties.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, who has voted on the GOP funding plan throughout the shutdown and criticized his own party’s stance, said Sunday that it is time to ”take the win.”\n \n\n   \n  Vote yes, he said, “and then we can find a way to lower our costs about health care.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/sport/football-nfl-former-commissioner-paul-tagliabue-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00.000-05:00","title":"Longtime NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue dies at 84","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Tagliabue, the former NFL commissioner who led the league from 1989 to 2006, has died at 84 from heart failure.

commissioner  but was criticized for not taking stronger action on concussions, died Sunday from heart failure at 84 years old.\n \n\n   \n  NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Tagliabue’s family informed the league of his death in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue, who had developed Parkinson’s disease, was commissioner after Pete Rozelle from 1989 to 2006. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of a special centennial class in 2020. Current Commissioner Roger Goodell succeeded Tagliabue.\n \n\n   \n  “Paul was the ultimate steward of the game — tall in stature, humble in presence and decisive in his loyalty to the NFL,” Goodell said in a statement. “I am forever grateful and proud to have Paul as my friend and mentor. I cherished the innumerable hours we spent together where he helped shape me as an executive but also as a man, husband and father.”\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue oversaw a myriad of new stadiums and negotiated television contracts that added billions of dollars to the league’s bank account. Under him, there were no labor stoppages.\n \n\n   \n  During his time, Los Angeles lost two teams and Cleveland another, migrating to Baltimore before being replaced by an expansion franchise.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue implemented a policy on substance abuse that was considered the strongest in all major sports. He also established the “Rooney Rule,” in which all teams with coaching vacancies must interview minority candidates. It has since been expanded to include front-office and league executive positions.\n \n\n   \n  When he took office in 1989, the NFL had just gotten its first Black head coach of the modern era. By the time Tagliabue stepped down in 2006, there were seven minority head coaches in the league.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue certainly had his detractors, notably over concussions. The issue has plagued the NFL for decades, though team owners had a major role in the lack of progress in dealing with head trauma.\n \n\n   \n  In 2017, Tagliabue apologized for remarks he made decades ago about concussions in football, acknowledging he didn’t have the proper data at the time in 1994. He called concussions “one of those pack-journalism issues” and contended the number of concussions “is relatively small; the problem is the journalist issue.”\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously,” he said on Talk of Fame Network, “I do regret those remarks. Looking back, it was not sensible language to use to express my thoughts at the time. My language was intemperate, and it led to serious misunderstanding. I overreacted on issues which we were already working on. But that doesn’t excuse the overreaction and intemperate language.\n \n\n   \n  “Bottom line, it sounded like I was shooting the messenger, which was the concussion issue. My intention at the time was to make a point which could have been made fairly simply: that there was a need for better data. There was a need for more reliable information about concussions and uniformity in terms of how they were being defined in terms of severity.”\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue is survived by his wife Chandler, son Drew, and daughter Emily.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/health/byheart-infant-formula-outbreak-positive-bacteria","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:15:00Z","title":"Preliminary Tests Find Germ That Causes Botulism in ByHeart Baby Formula","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Preliminary tests have found bacteria associated with botulism toxin in two lots of ByHeart baby formula, leading to at least 13 infants across 10 U.S. states being hospitalized.

Preliminary tests showed that ByHeart baby formula contained the type of bacteria that produces the toxin linked to  a botulism outbreak , California health officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The outbreak has sickened at least 13 infants in 10 states. No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers in possession of this product should stop using it immediately,” the California Department of Public Health said in a statement late Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  More tests of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula are pending as state and federal health officials investigate the outbreak that started in mid-August. The New York-based company this weekend recalled two lots of the powdered product.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know about the outbreak and infant botulism.\n \n\n   \n    Infant botulism outbreak\n \n\n   \n  The outbreak of infant botulism has sickened babies aged 2 weeks to 5 months since mid-August. All were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  The cases occurred in Arizona, California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart officials agreed to recall two lots of the company’s Whole Nutrition Infant Formula, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The formula has a best-by date of December 2026.\n \n\n   \n  California health officials tested a can of the powdered formula that was fed to a baby who fell ill. The results “suggest the presence” of the type of bacteria that produces the botulism toxin confirmed in other cases. It can take several days to confirm the results.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart officials said that “more testing is needed” to know whether the type of bacteria that causes botulism is present. It comes from a large family of bacteria, many of which are found naturally in the environment and don’t cause illness, the company said.\n \n\n   \n  “We take this very seriously,” it said in a statement Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA is investigating reports of 83 cases of infant botulism reported since August including the cases linked to Byheart baby formula.\n \n\n   \n    Causes of infant botulism\n \n\n   \n  Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It is caused by a type of bacteria that produces toxins in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis.\n \n\n   \n  Infants younger than 1 are particularly vulnerable and can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey.\n \n\n   \n  Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel “floppy” and can have problems swallowing or breathing.\n \n\n   \n  No known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, said Dr. Steven Abrams, a University of Texas nutrition expert.\n \n\n   \n  “This would be extremely rare,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Infant botulism treatment\n \n\n   \n  The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California’s Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators.\n \n\n   \n  All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said.\n \n\n   \n    Potential impact on U.S. formula supplies\n \n\n   \n  There is no danger of infant formula shortages because of this outbreak. ByHeart, which was founded in 2016, accounts for an estimated 1% of national formula sales, according to the CDC. The company sells formula through its website and in retail stores nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  That’s different that the crisis caused when formula produced by Abbott was linked to infant deaths and illnesses in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  That product was contaminated with a different germ that can cause severe illness and death in babies. Because Abbott is one of the top manufacturers of infant formula in the U.S., the closure of its manufacturing plant in Michigan triggered massive shortages of formula across the U.S.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company’s packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii, the germ at the heart of the Abbott crisis. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing “areas that still require corrective actions.”\n \n\n   \n    Reviewing infant formula ingredients\n \n\n   \n  Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul  the U.S. food supply  and are taking a new look at  infant formula .\n \n\n   \n  Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the Food and Drug Administration  to review  the nutrients and other ingredients in infant formula, which fills the bottles of millions of American babies.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, dubbed “Operation Stork Speed,” is the first deep look at the ingredients since 1998.\n \n\n   \n  FDA officials are reviewing comments from industry, health experts and public to decide next steps.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/media/resign-bbc-trump-speech-edit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:07:00Z","title":"BBC Leadership Resigns Amid Political Pressure Over Trump Documentary Edit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The resignation of BBC Director General Tim Davie and BBC News Chief Deborah Turness in November 2025 is attributed to a 'febrile' media environment marked by political attacks, editorial missteps, and intense scrutiny.

November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One word in  outgoing BBC boss  Tim Davie’s statement explains not just his resignation, but the political reality for media leaders in 2025: “Febrile.”\n \n\n   \n  To save you from Googling, Dictionary.com defines “febrile” as “a more formal way of saying feverish — having a fever.”\n \n\n   \n  Arguments over the BBC in recent days have certainly been fevered, but then again, those arguments are never-ending, owing to the broadcaster’s immense power and unique place in British public life.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, the job of BBC director general — though certainly prestigious —is also relentless and thankless. The current controversy over a misleading edit to a 2024 documentary about President Donald Trump illustrates the dynamic perfectly.\n \n\n   \n  In a vacuum, the more-than-a-year-old misstep by unnamed producers would not cause the very top heads of the organization to roll.\n \n\n   \n  But Britain’s right-wing press has been “feasting like vultures” over the bad edit, as a source at the BBC put it on condition of anonymity. And the corporation’s response to the row was feeble at best, enabling conservative critics to advance their long-running campaign against the broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  Trump celebrated the BBC shakeup on Sunday, but the political pressure over the documentary was just one of many factors at play.\n \n\n   \n  But in a politically poisonous atmosphere with near-daily disputes over coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza; the equally frequent attacks from the BBC’s rivals; and a looming review of the BBC’s license-fee model; it’s easy to understand why Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness both tendered their resignations. A sigh of relief was almost audible in their respective memos.\n \n\n   \n  “Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,” Davie wrote. Turness similarly wrote that “mistakes have been made.”\n \n\n   \n  BBC Radio 4 host and former BBC News political editor Nick Robinson spoke for many both inside and outside the organization when he said, one day before the resignations, “It’s clear that there is a genuine concern about editorial standards and mistakes. There is also a political campaign by people who want to destroy the organization.” Robinson’s point: “Both things are happening at the same time.”\n \n\n   \n  This all contributes to the fever that Davie referenced on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  He said the BBC board had unanimously supported him throughout his “entire tenure, including during recent days,” indicating he was not forced out. And he said “the current debate around BBC News” was just one factor in his departure.\n \n\n   \n  Another factor: The government is currently reviewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, which is the contract that determines how the BBC is funded and run. The current charter, which expires at the end of 2027, has a license-fee system in which British households pay £174.50 ($230) a year for BBC shows and services. This license fee structure has supported a diverse array of programming for decades, but has also opened up the BBC to all sorts of criticism.\n \n\n   \n  Some conservative leaders have argued that the license fee system is anachronistic in the age of Netflix and Spotify. They have also lobbed countless complaints about perceived political bias.\n \n\n   \n  Davie said, “I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering.”\n \n\n   \n    BBC faces politically charged media climate\n \n\n   \n  When Davie took charge in 2020, he said his No. 1 priority was “to renew our commitment to impartiality.”\n \n\n   \n  Most of the battles over the BBC relate back to that commitment in one way or another.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, for instance, the BBC removed “Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone” from its streaming service amid intense scrutiny of the documentary. The narrator was the son of a Hamas official, a conflict that breached the BBC’s editorial guidelines. Davie issued an apology after a review of the matter.\n \n\n   \n  BBC officials have highlighted and defended the news organization’s exhaustive reporting about the war. Similarly, they have urged people to take stock of the BBC’s coverage in totality — from groundbreaking exposes about the civil war   in Sudan   to thoughtful pieces about Trump’s second term in office.\n \n\n   \n  But all of that risks getting flattened when a partisan media firestorm erupts.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC is “blatant propaganda” and “total, 100% fake news,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Saturday in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper, fanning the proverbial flames against Davie and Turness.\n \n\n   \n  The trigger was a misleading edit in “Trump: A Second Chance?” In the documentary, portions of Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech to supporters at the Ellipse were stitched together to make it sound like he had said he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.” It was edited together to sound like one threatening sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tone was certainly combative that day, but in the actual speech, his exhortations to “fight” were separate from his suggestion about walking to the Capitol to “cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  The edit apparently escaped scrutiny when the documentary aired on “Panorama,” the BBC’s flagship current affairs program, shortly before the 2024 US presidential election. But it was subsequently described in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former editorial adviser to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee.\n \n\n   \n    Trump celebrates Davie’s exit\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph, which has published anti-BBC commentary for years, reported on the existence of the memo on November 3, triggering days of controversy in the United Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph published daily follow-ups about the “growing crisis at the corporation,” and amplified many critics, including by interviewing Leavitt. Meanwhile, the producers of the documentary, which was made by an outside production company, remained silent.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his aides treated Sunday’s resignations like personal victories. The president wrote on Truth Social that the BBC executives were “caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th.”\n \n\n   \n  There is no evidence that either executive was involved in the nitty gritty of the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also wrote “thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.”\n \n\n   \n  There is no indication that the edit was politically motivated. Furthermore, the documentary’s primary audience was in the UK, not the US.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt used the occasion to promote a right-wing upstart channel, GB News, that is sometimes described as the Fox News of the UK.\n \n\n   \n  To borrow Davie’s word, it is a “febrile” media environment, indeed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/usda-pauses-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"08:07:00-04:00","title":"USDA Orders States to Stop Issuing Full SNAP Benefits and to ‘Undo’ Benefits Sent for November","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directed states to halt the issuance of full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for November 2025 and to reverse any prior full allocations, following a temporary pause by Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on a lower court order that required full benefits.

(Many recipients will receive  less than 65% of their usual assistance  because of the way food stamp benefits are calculated.)\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  States that fail to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over issuances of benefits, the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly 1 in 8 Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program. Over the past week, the USDA has issued guidance multiple times as lawsuits over the agency’s decision not to tap into a contingency fund to pay November benefits have worked their way through federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  The latest guidance follows   a memorandum  from the department on Friday saying it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal lower court order, and that the process should be completed later that day.\n \n\n   \n  Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Friday that residents who should have already gotten their SNAP benefits this month will start getting their full payments on Friday. The next day, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that residents who received their benefits are able to spend them, but the state has paused issuing full allocations to additional people.\n \n\n   \n  Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that there’s “no clarity at all” in the guidance and that the administration is causing “intentional chaos.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once we decided to step up and say we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK … we’ve now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money,” Moore said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n \n\n   \n    Legal battles\n \n\n   \n  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday evening temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover  full food stamp benefits , siding with the administration on a short-term basis in a legal fight that has quickly become a defining confrontation of the  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The ruling meant the USDA does not have to immediately honor a lower court order that required it to transfer $4 billion to the key food assistance program.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s ruling followed one a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island that directed the agency to make the full payments, reversing his own order from earlier in the month requiring the USDA to tap into its $5.3 billion contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits for the month.\n \n\n   \n  His more expansive ruling mandated the agency shift tariff revenue meant for child nutrition programs to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in appropriations for the government.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling in recent weeks that the agency must at least pay partial benefits or, at its discretion, provide recipients with their full allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The agency opted to provide partial payments — first saying states could issue 50% of the maximum benefit and then revising the figure to 65%. But the USDA warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell last week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\n \n\n   \n    Providing full benefits\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards, according to the Department of Justice’s filing to the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to the USDA’s demand that states should undo any steps taken to issue full benefits, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said on Sunday, “No.”\n \n\n   \n  The state loaded November benefits onto the cards of nearly 700,000 residents on Friday prior to the Supreme Court’s pause, he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We are eager for the court to resolve this issue by directing the Trump Administration to comply with court orders and provide the certainty to the many Wisconsin families and businesses who rely on FoodShare,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, the filing said.\n \n\n   \n  These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, according to the DOJ. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “In accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.”\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina, which issued partial benefits to more than 586,000 households on Friday, said it was pausing the issuance of full benefits in light of the Supreme Court decision. It had hoped to issue them over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “The hard-working people and families who rely on SNAP benefits deserve certainty, not confusion about whether they’ll be able to put meals on the table this weekend and the rest of the month,” North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement Saturday. “I am urging for a swift resolution by the courts and some humanity from the Trump administration so North Carolina families can receive the support they need.”\n \n\n   \n  In Massachusetts, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey said that residents should continue spending the benefits on their EBT cards, noting the state funded them in accordance with USDA’s Friday guidance before the Supreme Court’s pause.\n \n\n   \n  “If President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court,” Healey said in a statement Sunday, adding that state officials will continue to work to “make sure everyone gets the full benefits they are owed.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN is reaching out to other states to ask the status of their SNAP programs.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Fritze and Devan Cole contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/science/new-glenn-rocket-launch-mars-escapade","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"16:58:00Z","title":"Landmark Mars mission and first big test for Jeff Bezos’ New Glenn rocket is delayed by weather","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, designed to compete with SpaceX, has been delayed twice due to weather conditions at Cape Canaveral, with its second launch attempt scheduled for Monday, November 9, 2025, during a 2:40–4:08 p.m. ET window.

Landmark Mars mission and first big test for Jeff Bezos’ New Glenn rocket is delayed by weather \n       \n  By Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:58 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New Glenn, the towering orbital rocket that  Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin  designed to compete with SpaceX’s dominant Falcon rockets, is back for its second launch ever — this time with a job to send twin spacecraft on a long, winding trip to Mars.\n \n\n   \n  The 322-foot (98-meter) rocket was set to take off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida during an 88-minute launch window that opened at 2:45 p.m. ET on Sunday. But Blue Origin revealed during  a livestream  that cloud cover rolled into the area, preventing liftoff. (Rockets often seek to avoid clouds because flying through one that is electrified can actually trigger a lightening strike.)\n \n\n   \n  “We’re reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt based on forecasted weather,” the company said in a social media post.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin officials previously indicated they have the ability to try again during a launch window on Monday. The weather forecast for that opportunity, however, appeared “somewhat consistent” with Sunday’s conditions, noted Laura Maginnis, New Glenn’s vice president of mission management, during a Saturday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  The Federal Aviation Administration recently said that it would be  putting a stop  to commercial rocket launches between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. ET, beginning Monday, to ease the burden on air traffic controllers amid the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working really closely with both our partners at the FAA and with the NASA team to ensure that we’re, of course, honoring and respecting the airspace expectations,” Maginnis said.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin’s launch window on Monday would run between 2:40 and 4:08 p.m. ET, according to a news release.\n \n\n   \n    Blue Origin aims to reuse rocket boosters\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin is also attempting to land and recover New Glenn’s first-stage booster, which is the bottommost portion of the rocket that gives the initial burst of power at liftoff, on a seafaring barge called Jacklyn. Much like Blue Origin’s  chief competitor, SpaceX  — which has long been a dominant force in the commercial launch business — Blue Origin rockets are designed to be partially reused in order to drive down costs.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin had hoped to nail its first attempt at landing a booster on New Glenn’s inaugural orbital flight in January, but engines failed to reignite properly, causing the rocket to veer off course.\n \n\n   \n  However, the primary mission of Blue Origin’s January launch — delivering a test satellite called the Blue Ring Pathfinder to orbit — went off without a hitch, prompting the company to declare the flight a success.\n \n\n   \n  But Blue Origin does view safely recovering and reusing its rocket boosters as crucial for its business model.\n \n\n   \n  Maginnis said during the Saturday news conference that working to pinpoint why the booster did not stick its landing in January, and implementing fixes to help it succeed this time around, were the primary reasons Blue Origin waited nearly 10 months to attempt a second New Glenn launch.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve incorporated a number of changes to our propellant management system, some minor hardware changes as well, to increase our likelihood of landing that booster,” Maginnis said.\n \n\n   \n  But, she added, “if we don’t land the booster — that’s OK. We have several more vehicles in production.”\n \n\n   \n  Maginnis declined to specify how many boosters Blue Origin has in production.\n \n\n   \n  The next New Glenn flight, which had been slated for this year but does not currently have a target launch date, is expected to deliver a Blue Origin-designed lunar lander called Mark 1 to the moon’s surface.\n \n\n   \n    NASA Escapade’s Mars mission\n \n\n   \n  After taking flight, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket will set twin satellites on a path into deep space. The orbiters are expected to linger in a holding pattern before heading for Mars next year when the red planet is better aligned for a less fuel-intensive journey.\n \n\n   \n  The mission, called Escapade — short for Escape and Plasma Acceleration Dynamics Explorers — is a low-cost planetary science project funded by NASA and spearheaded by the University of California, Berkeley, with support from commercial companies Advanced Space and Rocket Lab.\n \n\n   \n  If all goes to plan, the vehicles will arrive in Martian orbit in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  Once there, the spacecraft will work in tandem to investigate why the planet began to lose its atmosphere billions of years ago — and to study how its harsh climate may affect future explorers.\n \n\n   \n  “We will be making the space weather measurements we need to understand the system well enough to forecast solar storms whose radiation could harm astronauts on the surface of Mars or in orbit,” said the mission’s principal investigator, Robert Lillis, of UC Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/trump-pay-americans-directly-healthcare","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s Proposal to Pay Americans Directly for Health Care Costs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has proposed redirecting the billions of dollars currently used to subsidize Affordable Care Act (ACA) premiums—paid to insurers—to be sent directly to Americans, allowing them to use the funds to purchase their own health care.

Rick Scott enthusiastically announced on X that he’s “writing the bill right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Currently, ACA enrollees who qualify for tax credits, also known as premium subsidies, never see the funds.

Lindsey Graham called the ACA “the biggest scam on the planet,” touting Trump’s proposition to put money in the pockets of Americans to purchase their own insurance plans.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina Republican predicted a weekend “breakthrough” in funding talks on Capitol Hill, where negotiators so far have not presented a compromise deal that includes an ACA solution that would win over enough Democrats to back a short-term bill to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’ll have a breakthrough today.

Wilkens, the godfather of Seattle basketball, dies at 88 \n       \n  By Associated Press, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:49 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Lenny Wilkens, a three-time inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame who was enshrined as both a player and a coach, has died, his family said Sunday. He was 88.\n \n\n   \n  The family said Wilkens was surrounded by loved ones when he died and did not immediately release a cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens was one of the finest point guards of his era who later brought his calm and savvy style to the sideline, first as a player-coach and then evolving into one of the game’s great coaches.\n \n\n   \n  He coached 2,487 games in the NBA, which is still a record. He became a Hall of Famer as a player, as a coach and again as part of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team — on which he was an assistant. Wilkens coached the Americans to gold at the Atlanta Games as well in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  “Lenny Wilkens represented the very best of the NBA — as a Hall of Fame player, Hall of Fame coach, and one of the game’s most respected ambassadors,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Sunday. “So much so that, four years ago, Lenny received the unique distinction of being named one of the league’s 75 greatest players and 15 greatest coaches of all time.”\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens was a nine-time All-Star as a player, was the first person to reach 1,000 wins as an NBA coach and was the second person inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player and coach. He coached the Seattle SuperSonics to the NBA title in 1979 and remained iconic in that city for the rest of his life, often being considered a godfather of sorts for basketball in Seattle — which lost the Sonics to Oklahoma City in 2008 and has been trying to get a team back since.\n \n\n   \n  And he did it all with grace, something he was proud of.\n \n\n   \n  “Leaders don’t yell and scream,” Wilkens told Seattle’s KOMO News earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens, the 1994 NBA coach of the year with Atlanta, retired with 1,332 coaching wins — a league record that was later passed by Don Nelson (who retired with 1,335) and then Gregg Popovich (who retired with 1,390).\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens played 15 seasons with the St. Louis Hawks, SuperSonics, Cleveland Cavaliers and Portland Trail Blazers. He was an All-Star five times with St. Louis, three times in Seattle and once with Cleveland in 1973 at age 35. A statue depicting his time with the SuperSonics was installed outside  Climate Pledge Arena  in June.\n \n\n   \n  “Even more impressive than Lenny’s basketball accomplishments, which included two Olympic gold medals and an NBA championship, was his commitment to service — especially in his beloved community of Seattle where a statue stands in his honor,” Silver said. “He influenced the lives of countless young people as well as generations of players and coaches who considered Lenny not only a great teammate or coach but also an extraordinary mentor who led with integrity and true class.”\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens twice led the league in assists but was also a prominent scorer. He averaged in double figures scoring in every season of his career, except his final one in 1974-75 with the Trail Blazers. His best season as a scorer came in his first season with the SuperSonics in 1968-69 when he averaged 22.4 points, 8.2 assists and 6.2 rebounds.\n \n\n   \n  Leonard Wilkens was born on Oct. 28, 1937, in New York. His basketball schooling came on Brooklyn’s playgrounds and at a city powerhouse, then Boys High School, where one of his teammates was major league baseball star Tommy Davis. He would go on to star at Providence and was drafted by the Hawks as the sixth overall pick in 1960.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/trump-washington-commanders-stadium-name-nfl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:16:00-05:00","title":"White House says Washington Commanders stadium bearing Trump’s name would be ‘beautiful’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House has expressed support for naming the Washington Commanders' new stadium in Washington, D.C., after President Donald Trump, calling it 'beautiful' and crediting him for enabling the stadium’s rebuilding.

Other personnel are troops with the National Guard, the  reserve arm  of the Army and Air Force.\n \n\n   \n  Here is a look at the agencies involved and how their complicated and often overlapping duties have evolved under the current administration’s deportation policy.\n \n\n   \n    Customs and Border Protection\n \n\n   \n  In its  own words , US Customs and Border Protection “is one of the world’s largest law enforcement organizations and is charged with keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the U.S. while facilitating lawful international travel and trade.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency started as the Customs Administration in 1789 to collect tariffs, the federal government’s primary source of revenue at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Back then, the United States was effectively an “open borders” country until the passage of a  law  in 1875 blocking the immigration of most Chinese women on the premise of curbing prostitution and human trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Full federal border inspections under a new agency  began  in 1891, which later became the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n \n\n   \n  The functions of enforcing immigration law and collecting tariffs and customs duties stayed separate until shortly after the   September 11 terror attacks , when a push to consolidate more agencies under the new Department of Homeland Security  created  Customs and Border Protection in 2003.\n \n\n   \n  “The intent was to create a single focused agency responsible for issues at the border,” Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service who is now at the Migration Policy Institute, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The sizeable agency has more than  60,000 employees , including about 20,000 Border Patrol agents, all tasked with one mission: “Protect the American people, safeguard our borders, and enhance the nation’s economic prosperity.”\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  Two decades later, the Border Patrol division of CBP has taken on an increasingly significant role in high-profile immigration actions under Trump, with sector chief  Gregory Bovino  emerging as the  on-the-ground face  of “Operation Midway Blitz.” The initiative targets “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago,”  DHS says .\n \n\n   \n  Armed agents, who once apprehended migrants across the US’s borders and stopped drug and human trafficking operations, now stand sentinel over federal immigration facilities that are the sites of immigration protests.\n \n\n   \n  “These officers are not accustomed to policing urban civil unrest; nor are they trained to do so,” former CBP Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske  testified  in a  lawsuit  filed by journalists. The lawsuit stemmed from what they called “overwhelming and illegal violence” against protesters in Los Angeles this summer, a response that was also helmed by Bovino.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions from the summer’s violent clashes between immigration officers and demonstrators continued to boil over this fall in America’s largest cities.\n \n\n   \n   Jason Houser , a former DHS official, said the current administration is putting Border Patrol agents in security and crowd control situations they’re not equipped to handle.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re trained for border interdiction, terrorist threats, drug interdictions on swift boats,” Houser said. “Those tactics aren’t for de-escalation of a protest or riots. That’s not their core training.”\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago, the indelible image of a  pastor in a clerical collar  shot in the head with a pepper ball by agents standing on the rooftop of an ICE building is a direct violation of CBP’s use of force  policy .\n \n\n   \n  Officers using pepper balls “shall not intentionally target the head, neck, spine, or groin of the intended subject, unless the use of deadly force is reasonable,” ﻿the  policy  states.\n \n\n   \n  But Bovino, who has said agents have acted proportionally and in response to attacks from demonstrators, expressed ambivalence about protesters being injured – also a direct violation of CBP’s use of force  policy. \n \n\n   \n  “If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that’s on them,” Bovino  told CBS News  in October. “Don’t protest and don’t trespass.”\n \n\n   \n  Like many law enforcement agencies since 9/11, the CBP has substantially beefed up its equipment with military-style weaponry and aircraft, including a  fleet  of Black Hawk helicopters and Predator drones.\n \n\n   \n  The equipment was put to use in an  overnight raid  in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood, when agents clad in tactical gear  rappelled  from a Black Hawk helicopter and burst through the windows of an apartment building to pull families from their homes.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been on military bases for a good portion of my life, and the activity I saw – it was an invasion,”  said  neighbor Darrell Ballard.\n \n\n   \n  The show of force in Operation Midway Blitz even included sending  speedboats  – the kind   typically seen on the waterways along the nation’s borders – to patrol the Chicago River, in the shadow of the Windy City’s Trump International Hotel and Tower.\n \n\n   \n  The boats “are from Detroit. Those are interdiction patrol boats that patrol up and down the border between Canada and Michigan,” said Houser, who worries their presence in Chicago leaves the northern border vulnerable.\n \n\n   \n  “If they’re not there in Michigan, does that mean those smuggling lines are open that day, but they were out going up and down (the Chicago River) like it was St. Patrick’s Day?”\n \n\n   \n  CBP has not said if the Border Patrol assets used on the Chicago River impacted operations along the Canadian border and did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  While a city that is more than 400 miles from the nearest international border crossing may seem like an unusual choice for intense stops and searches, there is a legal loophole.\n \n\n   \n  The CBP can legally conduct warrantless searches of vehicles and property believed to be involved in immigration violations anywhere within 100 miles of the US border or coastline. The agency also  includes  the entire coastline of Lake Michigan, which lies fully within the United States, as the “functional equivalent” of an international border.\n \n\n   \n  Under CBP policy, Chicago is as much of a border town as El Paso, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “Border enforcement does need to be as modern as possible and as updated as possible in terms of technology,” Meissner said. “But it should be taking place at the border because that’s the crossing point.”\n \n\n   \n    Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n \n\n   \n  Like its cousin CBP, ICE started as part of the new Department of Homeland Security in 2003. But in addition to having a catchier name, ICE had a different mission – focus on the nation’s interior to catch and deport undocumented immigrants, along with investigating “narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, gang violence, money laundering and other financial crimes,” the agency’s website  says .\n \n\n   \n  To accomplish these two very different tasks, the agency has two divisions: Enforcement and Removal Operations, which deports people in the country illegally, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), where  agents  “launch and pursue investigations into transnational crime.”\n \n\n   \n  During the Biden administration, HSI took steps to rebrand itself and  set up  its own website to try to distinguish its work from deportations.\n \n\n   \n  “The civil immigration enforcement side of the ICE mission is not what HSI does,” Katrina Berger, then-executive associate director of HSI,  told ABC News  last year, a few months before retiring.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of his second term, Trump made clear that ICE – including HSI – has a singular focus under his administration.\n \n\n   \n  “The primary mission of (HSI) is the enforcement of … (laws) related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States,” the president  said  in an executive order signed on Inauguration Day.\n \n\n   \n  The HSI patch on uniforms has become a common sight in immigration raids. It was the lead agency in the  operation  at a Georgia Hyundai plant in September that  rounded up  nearly 500 workers accused of being in the country illegally.\n \n\n   \n  While HSI is typically the  lead  on worksite enforcement issues, former agency leaders fear that increasing HSI’s focus on removing undocumented workers from the country comes at the expense of investigating more significant dangers to the US, like targeting the importation of  fentanyl  and firearms  smuggling .\n \n\n   \n  “HSI, within ICE, has always been focused on human smuggling, sex trafficking, cybercrimes, Deep Web threats to children,” said Houser, who served as the ICE chief of staff during the Biden administration. “What we see now is a fundamental shifting away from that focus on national security.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency has also faced criticism for  aggressive tactics  used by ICE agents in executing the president’s immigration policy. Migrants have been  pulled from cars ,  off streets  and  tackled in courthouses  by masked agents.\n \n\n   \n  The heavy-handed tactics have also been used to control crowds at protests, where federal agents have at times used pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear gas to clear  demonstrators .\n \n\n   \n  ICE and US Customs and Border Protection agents are trained “to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officers under DHS are “highly trained” in de-escalation tactics and “regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois’ Democratic governor disagreed, accusing the agents of being provocative with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “ICE is causing this mayhem,” Gov. JB Pritzker  said . “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois state Rep. Hoan Huynh says he got firsthand experience after accusing an ICE agent of  pointing a gun  at him when he was following an ICE vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  “These are ICE agents who are wearing masks. Their badges aren’t very clear,” Huynh  told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not comment on whether a gun was drawn, but McLaughlin accused Huynh of “stalking law enforcement” and said agents had to “assess if he was a threat.”\n \n\n   \n  Huynh’s encounter demonstrates the difficulty people have just figuring out what agency an officer represents, especially since most DHS agencies do not have standard uniforms.\n \n\n   \n   Video  of the incident shows the  ICE agents  wearing camo uniforms marked with “POLICE.” The agency’s tan and olive shoulder patch blends into the camouflage color scheme. On a backpack, another agent is identified as being with “SRT,” the ICE Special Response Team, with SWAT-style training. Another uniform appears to say BORTAC, the Border Patrol’s own tactical unit. None of the uniforms seen in the video specifically said ICE.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Chicago expressed her own concerns about the confusion caused when agents aren’t clearly identified, issuing an  order  that all agents “must have visible identification.”\n \n\n   \n  “The way that they’re carrying on without any visible identification – even that they’re law enforcement, much less what agency they’re with – it really is pretty unprecedented to see at this scale, and I think it’s very dangerous,”  said Scott Shuchart , a senior ICE official during the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just the uniforms – masked federal officers have also become the  new calling card  of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  DHS officials say the masks are necessary to deal with increasing threats against ICE agents, including violence from protesters and doxxing.\n \n\n   \n  Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has said  federal officers are covering up to protect their families  after some have been publicly identified and then harassed online, along with relatives.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a proponent of the masks at all, but if it’s going to keep officers safe, it’s going to keep people from using advanced AI to find out their addresses and their families’ information, then by all means I’ll let them do it,” he  told NewsNation  in October.\n \n\n   \n   John Sandweg , an acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama and a former acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, has been on dozens of ride-alongs during his tenure and said he never saw anyone wear a mask.\n \n\n   \n  “When you’re at ICE and you’re at DHS, the first and highest priority is the safety of the workforce, and you have to do what’s necessary to protect them, but I think there’s no doubt it’s gone past what any reasonable policy would allow, and it really has to be a situation where it’s the exception, not the rule,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    US Coast Guard\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard was created in 1915 after a  merger  of agencies that focused on maritime tax evasion and emergency response on the high seas. The Coast Guard is responsible for “safety, security, and stewardship” on the water.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, its jurisdiction has expanded to include coverage of inland waterways, coastlines, bridges and ports.\n \n\n   \n  It is the only agency of government that is a branch of the military but operates as a civilian law enforcement agency during peacetime. The Coast Guard has been under civilian command since the end of World War II, and DHS has been in charge of the agency since 2003.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard’s unique hybrid structure straddling the military and civilian worlds allows Trump a great deal of leeway in deployment. But the administration has turned its focus to largely urban areas instead of waterways, relegating the Coast Guard to a supporting role.\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard said it was  preparing to support CBP agents  at the Coast Guard base in Alameda, California.\n \n\n   \n  It is working with other agencies to “detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border,” the Coast Guard told CNN affiliate  KCRA .\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Coast Guard “ personnel defensively fired their weapons ” at a U-Haul truck backing toward them outside the Coast Guard base in Alameda, where a  protest  had taken place against an anticipated federal deployment in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n \n\n   \n  No Coast Guard personnel were hurt, DHS  said  at the time, and the driver’s injury was not life-threatening,  according to  the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.\n \n\n   \n  Trump later  stood down  on plans to “surge” resources to San Francisco after friends, including local tech executives Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Marc Benioff of Salesforce, told him San Francisco had made “substantial progress” against crime.\n \n\n   \n    National Guard\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard says its beginnings go back more than a century before the Revolutionary War, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony  established  its own permanent militia. But the current organization didn’t come  until 1933 , when the National Guard Mobilization Act created a unique two-tiered structure.\n \n\n   \n  Today’s National Guard is the descent of state militias and also the combat reserve for the Army and Air Force. The National Guard is under the direction of its state’s governor, who decides when and where to deploy troops. The president has full power over the  DC National Guard  and can also federalize the states’ National Guard for US operations in the case of an emergency when “regular forces” are unable to enforce federal law. Exactly what the law means by “regular forces” is still being discussed in the courts.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Trump’s call-ups this year in Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon, the last time the National Guard was put under federal control for an operation within American borders was during the Los Angeles riots in 1992 – and it was  coordinated with state officials  at the time.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s attempt to invoke a rarely used law to deploy National Guard troops to several major American cities to curb crime and shut down protests has been one of the most striking and legally aggressive moves by the president — and one that’s come up against legal  challenges   over  and  over  again.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration recently attempted to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to protect ICE facilities that have been targeted by demonstrators in  Chicago  and  Portland , comparing the cities to a war zone and saying there is either “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion”  there .\n \n\n   \n  “You look at a place like Portland, it’s just — it’s ridiculous, when they say that there’s no problem. The place is — it was on fire over the weekend,” the president  said  last month.\n \n\n   \n  But both deployments have been halted by federal judges who say there is no justification to bring in the military.\n \n\n   \n  In  August , Trump  announced he is placing  the Washington, DC, police department “ under direct federal control ” and deploying National Guard troops to the nation’s capital, saying the move is aimed at restoring order in the city. The president has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC, but overall crime numbers are  lower this year  than in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,000 National Guard troops in DC are stationed throughout the city at metro stations and monuments or memorials, while other soldiers and airmen are helping with “beautification projects,” like picking up trash, replanting grass and spreading mulch.\n \n\n   \n  The ongoing mission costs about  $1 million  a day, experts estimated to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The president brought the stepped-up law enforcement model next to Memphis, Tennessee, in an attempt to crack down on crime. The move marked the first such effort in a Republican state, and Tennessee Republicans, including Gov. Bill Lee,  welcomed the announcement .\n \n\n   \n  Like in Washington, DC, the National Guard troops in Memphis are not dedicated just to securing federal property but are also supporting local law enforcement in their operations.\n \n\n   \n  Although the city’s leadership disagreed with the Guard’s deployment, officials have cooperated and  advised  residents that the troops will be “serving as extra ‘eyes and ears’ in our neighborhoods.”\n \n\n   \n  “I want to be clear I did not ask for the National Guard and I don’t think it is the way to drive down crime,” Mayor Paul Young  said  in September. “However, that decision has already been made.”\n \n\n   \n  Young and others said they wanted the task force to  focus on targeting violent offenders  rather than use their presence to scare, harass or intimidate the general public.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic-elected officials in Tennessee filed a  lawsuit   trying to stop the Memphis deployment, but the court has taken no action yet.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, graphic designer Leah Abucayan and photo editor Austin Steele contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/health/infant-formula-recall-botulism","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"11:02:00-05:00","title":"Infant Botulism Linked to Formula Recall in 10 U.S. States","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A voluntary recall of two lots of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula has been initiated after 13 infants across 10 U.S. states—Arizona, California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington—were hospitalized due to suspected infant botulism.

They might walk and talk through a busy street or store. There’s a warm camera filter, and quick cuts, as they move rapid-fire through a list of talking points and policies.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at how some Democrats are producing content echoing the Mamdani style.\n \n\n   \n    The Mamdani aesthetic\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s videos are instantly recognizable by the saturated colors that help them stand out on social feeds crowded with content.\n \n\n   \n  The videos are also characterized by quick cuts and big gestures — a tendency Mamdani joked about in one spot: “My team says I move my hands too much,” he  says .\n \n\n   \n  It’s an aesthetic that’s worked for other Democrats, including a pair of progressives in Michigan’s Democratic Senate primary.\n \n\n   \n  Former Detroit public health official Abdul El-Sayed scored a hit with a video using burgers to illustrate billionaire excess, similar to a Mamdani video that used mango lassis to explain New York’s ranked choice voting system. And state Sen. Mallory McMorrow earned her own viral moment with a video highlighting grocery prices, calling to mind Mamdani’s bodega tours.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Mamo, a Democratic strategist advising McMorrow and Texas state Rep. James Talarico, another 2026 US Senate contender, underscored the importance of visually engaging content.\n \n\n   \n  “Understand that you’re not just competing against the other Democrats in the primary. You’re not just competing against the Republicans,” Mamo explained. “You are competing against dog videos and sports highlights and Netflix on your other television and someone FaceTiming you and your group chat for attention on your phone and on your laptop and on your iPad.”\n \n\n   \n    The substance: affordability\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s campaign insists that its relentless focus on affordability was equally important to the success. “The style is downstream from the substance,” said Andrew Epstein, a top campaign aide.\n \n\n   \n  “Unless you have a message and an agenda that is directly relevant to people’s lives that speaks to the economic conditions in this country, that credibly presents itself as an alternative to this incredibly broken status quo and the alienation that so many people feel from mainstream politics — it’s not going to work,” Epstein said.\n \n\n   \n  Roxie Richner, El-Sayed’s communications director, echoed the Mamdani team’s emphasis on the issues.\n \n\n   \n  “I think at the end of the day, what resonates with people is the substance,” Richner said, pointing to one of El-Sayed’s  videos  in which “he explained the privatization of the Bay City bridges in Bay City, Michigan, in a way that people understood and that maybe folks in other parts of the state weren’t aware of it.”\n \n\n   \n  And while many politicians have taken to addressing voters’ concerns about affordability, strategists pointed to the importance of getting specific, exemplified by Mamdani’s focus on everyday pressure points like rents and bus fares.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not the affordability crisis in this country — it’s, ‘I need new deodorant and it’s $13.99, when did deodorant get to be $13.99?” Mamo said. “If you’re sitting in a bar, that is how you would say that. And if you’re on video, you should say it the same way, if you’re explaining it to your neighbor or a stranger at the bar, it’s the same way you should talk on camera.”\n \n\n   \n    Emulation, not imitation\n \n\n   \n  Soon after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary this summer, rival Andrew Cuomo began producing videos in which he was walking and talking in soft-filter video. Mamdani’s team noticed.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean, I want to say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but in Andrew’s case, I think it’s a lot more pathetic than that, frankly,” Epstein said.\n \n\n   \n  Other strategists underlined the importance of authenticity in campaign communications, with candidates across the country from different backgrounds facing a diverse array of issues.\n \n\n   \n  “It has to be real to you,” Mamo said, pointing to the example of California Sen. Adam Schiff. “He’s a lawyer, a professor and an explainer. So their videos are lawyer-professor-explainer, Adam Schiff, lawyer-professor- explaining what’s going on in Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  And Richner with El-Sayed’s campaign in Michigan said  Tuesday’s election results  demonstrated the party’s need for talented communicators.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether it was bringing down utility prices in New Jersey, or it was making buses faster and free in New York, I think people are suffering in this moment, and they want to believe that things can be better, and they need leaders and messengers that can show them that,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/us/new-york-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree","dateOfPublication":"1109-10-09","timeOfPublication":"10:56:00-05:00","title":"Rockefeller Center Christmas tree arrives in Manhattan, kicking off New York’s holiday season","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, a 75-foot Norway spruce from East Greenbush, New York, was delivered to Manhattan on November 9, 2025, marking the official start of New York City’s holiday season.

‘a new moment’ for party \n       \n  By Kaanita Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:52 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Democrats’  sweeping election victory  on Tuesday, including the approval of a  redistricting ballot measure  in his state, “represents a new moment” for the Democratic Party as it debates its path forward.\n \n\n   \n  “Clarity, conviction, purpose, energy. On our toes, not on our heels. A resurgent Democratic Party, and it’s a party that understands what’s at stake for our democracy,” Newsom said during a wide-ranging interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in Houston on Saturday.   \n \n\n   \n  Along with the approval of California’s Proposition 50, which creates five US House seats more favorable for Democrats, the party won in high-profile races across the country on Tuesday.  Zohran Mamdani  was elected mayor of New York City, while  Abigail Spanberger  and  Mikie Sherrill  won gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom traveled to Houston on Saturday for a rally, during which he touted the win and also credited Texas Democrats for inspiring the push for Proposition 50.\n \n\n   \n  “I think just the energy that the delegation from Texas brought to the Democratic Party, to democracy as a whole, when they stood up and pushed back against (Texas Gov.) Greg Abbott and Donald Trump’s overreach … in many ways that was the beginning of this comeback,” Newsom said to Tapper following the rally.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Texas Republicans moved to redraw the state’s congressional maps to shift five US House seats to the right at President Donald Trump’s behest. The move sparked outrage among state legislative Democrats, who left Texas to avoid a vote. They  ultimately returned , and the maps were passed and  signed into law .\n \n\n   \n  In response, Democrats in California began the efforts to redraw the state’s congressional maps. Newsom, who is widely expected to be a 2028 presidential candidate,  made himself the face  of California’s redistricting efforts and nationalized the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom acknowledged criticism that California made the redistricting process partisan, including from  Republican former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , and told Tapper that he supports “independent redistricting.”\n \n\n   \n  “But you can’t do it state by state with one arm tied behind your back,” he said. “You can’t unilaterally disarm as other people are not playing by the rules.”\n \n\n   \n  After the GOP win in Texas, Republicans have also redrawn seats in their favor in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio, and they are attempting to do the same in other states, including Indiana and Kansas.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, following California’s lead, Democrats are seeking changes to maps in at least three other states: New York, Virginia and Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not screwing around. They’re consolidating power,” Newsom said of Republicans’ efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom also weighed in on attending the COP30 climate summit this week in Brazil as the Trump administration has decided not to send a  high-level delegation .\n \n\n   \n  When asked what his role will be at the summit and whether he’s standing in for the president, Newsom said he’ll be “standing in for my kids and grandkids, for common sense, for, you know, our economic future.”    \n \n\n   \n  During the interview, Newsom also reiterated his warnings of the threat he says Trump poses to democracy.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, Newsom claimed, “it’s not about the rule of law. It’s about the rule of Don.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is not normal times,” he later added. “The rules have changed and we need to change.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Eric Bradner, Arit John and David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/americas/brazil-rio-deadly-raid-criminal-gangs-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"16:27:00Z","title":"Behind Rio’s deadly raid: Brazil’s billion-dollar criminal networks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the October 28, 2025, 'Operation Containment' raid in Rio de Janeiro, targeting Brazil’s long-standing Red Command (CV) gang in the Complexo da Penha and Complexo do Alemão favelas.

deadly raid: Brazil’s billion-dollar criminal networks \n       \n  By Alessandra Freitas, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:27 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Armored vehicles rumbling through narrow alleys. Rifle shots cracking in heavy crossfire. Helicopters and weaponized drones firing from above. Soldiers in military gear engaged in violent combat. Bodies scattered on blood-slicked streets.\n \n\n   \n  These could be scenes from a war zone.  But on October 28, they unfolded not on a desolate battlefield but on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro — a postcard city better known for its breathtaking coastline and lively bossa nova music scene.\n \n\n   \n  “Operation Containment” brought 2,500 police officers, soldiers and snipers up the slopes of Rio’s Complexo da Penha and Complexo do Alemão favelas, home to roughly 110,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  Their target was the Comando Vermelho (CV), or Red Command, a criminal organization that has ruled these hillside shantytowns for decades. During the operation, at least 117 suspected gunmen and four police officers were killed, and about 100 people were arrested. Authorities said they seized 118 weapons, including 91 rifles and 14 explosive devices, as well as a ton of drugs.\n \n\n   \n  The raid followed a year-long investigation into the Red Command and was triggered in part by the gang’s expansion into new territories, a recent surge in violence and an effort by authorities to reassert state control.\n \n\n   \n  Officials called the raid a success. But with at least 121 dead, and early reports putting the toll at 132, the operation drew sharp criticism from local and international human rights groups. It also laid bare a deep divide over how to confront Brazil’s entrenched organized crime syndicates.\n \n\n   \n    Life in a crossfire\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not the first time we see blood being spilled for a ‘greater good,’” said Thainã de Medeiros, who lived in Complexo da Penha for 35 years. “But this ‘good’ never comes.”\n \n\n   \n  Now a community organizer and member of an anti-violence collective who works in the favela, Medeiros is no stranger to how the Red Command instills fear in its territories. “You walk around and see people carrying big rifles on every corner, standing by your door with grenades and pistols,” he said. “No one feels safe. And there is always the risk of instability — of another operation like this.”\n \n\n   \n  The gangs also “determine who gets in and operates inside the communities,” said Rafael Alcadipani, a member of the Brazilian Forum on Public Security, a nonprofit civic group. “Internet companies, for instance, need to pay them a fee to offer service in the area. They issue permits for people to build houses — not the government.”\n \n\n   \n  The rise in violence, weaponry and gang control in the favelas has made it increasingly difficult for government officials and police to access these areas.\n \n\n   \n  “The state abandons these communities, and then gangs end up gaining even more control,” Alcadipani said.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s criminal organizations have also extended their reach from the illegal economy to politics through such means as vote-buying, violence, intimidation and the funding of political candidates, as studies and police investigations have found, helping them to become one of the most powerful gangs in South America.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A necessary operation’\n \n\n   \n  Luiz Lima, a right-leaning congressman representing Rio, defended the October 28 raid as unavoidable.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a necessary operation,” Lima told CNN. “What happened that day — 117 criminals killed — happens every day in Brazil. With more than 38,000 homicides last year, “that’s 106 deaths a day,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lima insisted that the public backs a tougher stance and that the vast majority of favela residents supported the operation.\n \n\n   \n  “The people living there are extorted,” he said. “Their shops are extorted. Women are raped by traffickers. It’s unbearable.”\n \n\n   \n  But Daniela Fichino, deputy director of the human rights group Global Justice, blames “a state policy that defines an entire population as disposable.” She added: “Brazil doesn’t have the death penalty, and yet the state acts as if it does — simultaneously finding, prosecuting and executing young, Black, poor residents under the banner of public security.”\n \n\n   \n  The result, Fichino said, is “a perpetual cycle of war that reinforces the very criminal structures it claims to dismantle.”\n \n\n   \n  The debate over lasting solutions reveals the complexity of how criminal organizations have grown so powerful, weaving themselves into nearly every layer of Brazilian society over time.\n \n\n   \n    A faction born from dictatorship\n \n\n   \n  The Red Command was founded in 1979 inside an island prison off the coast of Rio, the Cândido Mendes Penitentiary, where common criminals were locked up alongside leftist political prisoners opposed to the Brazilian military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. In the harsh conditions there, what began as an informal alliance for protection soon became an organized network.\n \n\n   \n  One of its founders, William da Silva Lima, spent more than 30 years behind bars after being convicted of armed robbery, extortion and kidnapping. In prison, he became a spokesman for other inmates and negotiated with authorities.\n \n\n   \n  The deplorable conditions inside the nineteenth-century Cândido Mendes — long known among inmates as the “Cauldron of Hell” — pushed prisoners to organize in resistance, da Silva Lima wrote in his 2010 book, recounting the origin of the Red Command and his part in creating the Brazilian organized crime group.\n \n\n   \n  When political prisoners were released in 1979, da Silva Lima wrote, members of what was then called the Falange Vermelha  or Red Phalanx, began orchestrating mass prison breaks and investing in the burgeoning cocaine trade.\n \n\n   \n  By 1985, the Red Command controlled roughly 70% of all drug-selling points in Rio — and the city’s deadly turf wars with other factions began.\n \n\n   \n  According to Márcio Sérgio Christino, a São Paulo state criminal prosecutor and author of a book on the gangs, while the Red Command is Brazil’s oldest faction, it is not the biggest — although its recent expansion shows it aims to achieve that goal. Its main obstacle is not the police or the government, he said, but a competing faction: bigger, better organized and highly influential in South America.\n \n\n   \n    Brazil’s biggest underground empire: The PCC\n \n\n   \n  Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), or First Capital Command, is a criminal organization created in 1993 that also has its genesis in a prison — the Taubaté Penitentiary in São Paulo. Its founders were survivors of the Carandiru massacre the year before, when 111 inmates were killed by military police.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until February 2001 that the group revealed its full reach. In what became known as the “big rebellion,” PCC members coordinated uprisings in 29 prisons simultaneously. About 27,000 inmates were involved, leaving at least 16 killed and 77 injured, among those incarcerated and police officers. At the end of the 27-hour uprising, the flag of the PCC — black and white, some accompanied by handmade signs reading “peace and justice” — was raised across São Paulo’s penitentiaries. The message was clear: the state had lost control.\n \n\n   \n  “At first, their focus was … controlling the prison environment,” Christino explained. “Then they began to grow, to organize, and one of their main pillars became the drug trade.”\n \n\n   \n  To obtain a higher-quality supply of cocaine, the PCC expanded into Brazil’s border states with Bolivia and Paraguay — two of South America’s main cocaine sources. With the US market already dominated by Mexico and Colombia, cocaine producers in landlocked Bolivia focused on reaching Europe, and a deal was struck.\n \n\n   \n  “Bolivia agreed to sell only to the PCC,” Christino said. “In return, the PCC handled transport, logistics and sales — to Europe, Africa, and beyond.”\n \n\n   \n    From friends to rivals\n \n\n   \n  Until then, the Red Command and PCC were not enemies. But their fragile coexistence collapsed once the Red Command, blocked from Bolivia, turned to Peru and built a cocaine trade that operates almost entirely within Brazil. Notably, the gang came to dominate supply routes through the northern part of the country, using the major rivers and their tributaries of the Amazon region.\n \n\n   \n  Competition over these routes ignited a series of prison riots and massacres across northern Brazil, Christino said.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at those uprisings — dozens, sometimes hundreds of deaths, even cannibalism — that was all about the routes,” he said. “It was a territorial war.”\n \n\n   \n  The syndicates now clash for control of Brazil’s highways, rivers and prisons as they branch out into other criminal realms.\n \n\n   \n  A 2025 study by the Brazilian Forum on Public Security found that gangs such as the Red Command and PCC generated 146.8 billion Brazilian reais ($27 billion) in 2022 through the illegal trade of gold, fuel, alcohol and cigarettes — nearly 10 times more than from cocaine trafficking, which was estimated at 15 billion reais ($2.8 billion).\n \n\n   \n  They also engage in money laundering and invest in construction firms, transport companies, fuel distributors and even crypto markets to wash billions of reals in illicit profits.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the command centers: An ongoing battle\n \n\n   \n  Investigations by the Public Ministry of Rio de Janeiro show that gang leaders continue to issue orders from behind bars — through coded messages, letters and encrypted apps.\n \n\n   \n  While high-risk inmates have been isolated in individual cells, the flow of information never truly stops, said Christino. “There’s no such thing as absolute isolation,” he said. “Cellphones still get in, and when they don’t, messages travel through lawyers or visitors. There’s always a way.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, the Federal District’s Secretariat of Penitentiary Administration said that “intelligence units operate in close coordination with other security forces and the judiciary to monitor faction-linked inmates.” They work to determine an inmate’s position in the hierarchy and isolate leaders “to prevent them from issuing orders,” the secretariat said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite these measures, investigators acknowledge that Brazil’s penitentiaries remain the backbone of command and communication for its largest criminal organizations — a paradox that the state struggles to contain.\n \n\n   \n  “The state’s militarized response only strengthens the factions,” Alcadipani said. “Each operation kills dozens, but the leadership remains. For every man who dies, another fills the gap … What we have now is reactive — a war without an endgame.”\n \n\n   \n  “We were about to launch a partnership with UNICEF” to help favela youth enter the job market, said Medeiros, the community organizer. Career fairs were scheduled for the day after the deadly operation in the Rio favelas. “We had to cancel everything,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, I thought today I’d be finalizing the details for that beautiful day,” he said. “Instead, we were cleaning bodies from the streets. And now, we’re bracing for what’s next.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/climate/paris-agreement-anniversary-cop30","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"09:05:00-05:00","title":"It’s been a dangerous decade since the Paris Climate Agreement, but there’s still reason for hope","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reflects on the decade since the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, acknowledging that despite initial optimism, global emissions have continued to rise, climate disasters have intensified, and political leaders like Donald Trump have undermined climate science.

decade since the Paris Climate Agreement, but there’s still reason for hope \n       \n  Analysis by John D. Sutter\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:05 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A decade ago, the world got together and decided to fix the climate crisis by adopting the Paris Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  I remember it like yesterday. This was December 2015 at the UN climate talks in Paris. I was standing in front of a CNN camera as the news came through an earpiece: Nearly every country on Earth agrees to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 — holding warming short of catastrophic levels. A hilariously on-the-nose green gavel hit a desk. The convention center erupted in applause. Diplomats wept and hugged. Even Al Gore managed to not look all that wooden.\n \n\n   \n  My column the next morning trumpeted this headline: “ This is the end of fossil fuels .”\n \n\n   \n  Somehow, it doesn’t feel like 10 years and some 300 gigatons of carbon have floated by since then.\n \n\n   \n  Paris was not the end of fossil fuels, of course. From the perspective of the atmosphere, the last decade could accurately be described as a slow-moving fever dream — one in which pollution from fossil fuels has continued to rise year after year. All those emissions drive global heating and make the planet more dangerous.\n \n\n   \n  And in this dangerous decade climate disasters have continued to intensify — from the massive hurricane that  walloped Puerto Rico in 2017 , to Jamaica this October where  the most powerful Atlantic storm  on record came aground.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a decade in which  new fossil fuel projects continued to be approved  by the very governments that had promised to slash emissions; and one in which the United States twice elected a climate-denier to the nation’s highest office. This fall, US President Donald Trump, after  cancelling billions toward clean energy projects  and  moving to open a swath of the Arctic for oil extraction , bucked the scientific consensus on global warming again by falsely stating that climate change is the “ greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world. ”\n \n\n   \n  Ironic, then, that this has also been a decade during which scientists realized that, if anything,  they underestimated some of the threats of climate change .\n \n\n   \n  Just last month, for example, researchers reported that Earth had crossed one of  its first climate tipping points , with such a massive percentage of coral reefs struggling amid warming that we’re entering a “new reality” in which those reefs won’t be able to recover.\n \n\n   \n  One key goal of the Paris Agreement was to prevent this sort of thing, by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. A group of especially climate-vulnerable countries, calling themselves the  High Ambition Coalition , banded together to push for that target. In Paris, delegates carried the rhyming theme over to wearing buttons that said, “1.5 to stay alive,” a reference to the existential threat warming poses, especially to low-lying areas that are flooding as ice melts and oceans rise.\n \n\n   \n  That “1.5 to stay alive” target, we now know, is almost certainly out of reach. Either  we’ve crossed that line already  or  we’re well on the way . Does that mean we’re “dead”? That we’ve failed to “stay alive”?\n \n\n   \n  No — thankfully, the world doesn’t burst into flames at 1.51 degrees of warming.\n \n\n   \n  We do know that every ton of heat-trapping pollution makes the world more dangerous. But, conversely, every ton of it we save makes the world safer for future generations. Yes, by many metrics, we’ve backslid in the years since Paris. Jamie Henn, co-founder of 350.org and director of Fossil Free Media, told me that if climate action is  Star Wars  then “I think we’re in the  Empire Strikes Back  episode of the trilogy” — where it all falls apart.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s still possible to adjust the lens and bring other storylines into focus.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve come an incredibly long way since Paris,” said Jean Su, energy justice director and senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. Of note, Su told me, is the fact that world leaders in 2023, at the COP meeting in Dubai,  added language to the Paris Agreement  that calls for moving away from fossil fuels. At that meeting, “we really reached a pinnacle in terms of addressing the root causes of the climate emergency,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Just because Trump thinks climate change is a scam, doesn’t mean the rest of the world agrees.\n \n\n   \n  Henn, the climate activist, pointed to renewable energy as a bright spot. In the first half of 2025,  renewables overtook coal  as the world’s top energy source for the first time. Wind and solar power — which don’t produce the heat-trapping pollution of coal and gas — are  expected to meet 90% of new electricity demand  this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The transition is moving  even faster than people predicted back in 2015 ,” Henn said.  Fifteen times faster , in fact, if you’re looking at solar power installations, according to the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, it continues to be crystal clear how the public feels about this issue: 89% of the global public  surveyed in a 2024 study  favored stronger political action on climate change.\n \n\n   \n  “That is a supermajority,” said Mark Hertsgaard, executive director of Covering Climate Now, the group behind a media collaboration called the  89 Percent Project . “And it’s a [super]majority that doesn’t know that it’s a majority. People in that majority think that they’re 29% of the population. They think they’re a minority.”\n \n\n   \n  But even in the United States, positive trends hold: 79% of registered voters  surveyed in May 2025  said they support the US being part of the Paris Agreement and 75% support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant.\n \n\n   \n  Climate advocates are planning new efforts to make use of this supermajority. Among them is a push for a  Fossil Fuel Nonproliferation Treaty . Alex Rafalowicz, executive director of that initiative, told me the idea for a treaty builds on an  International Court of Justice decision earlier this year  that held nations legally responsible for curbing climate-heating pollution.\n \n\n   \n  “The economics do demonstrate that the transition [to clean energy sources] has an inevitability about it,” Rafalowicz said. “But the question is whether it is fast enough, and whether it is fair enough. That is part of the problem we’re trying to solve.”\n \n\n   \n  A meeting about that treaty is likely to happen next spring in Colombia, he said. Meanwhile, the UN is prepping for COP30, in Brazil, which begins November 10. Plenty of the delegates there will remember that green gavel moment from Paris. I’ll be thinking of it as I watch news from the summit, too.\n \n\n   \n  On the day the Paris Agreement was adopted, I spent hours with the delegation from the Marshall Islands, a nation of low-lying islands in the Pacific that fears being subsumed by rising seas. I’d visited the country earlier in 2015 for a CNN article. I’ll never forget a woman telling me that the sound of the ocean, which used to lull her to sleep, had become threatening after waves crashed through her home and flooded it. Her family had decided to move to Arkansas to get far away from the water and that sound.\n \n\n   \n  The Marshallese delegation in Paris gave me a palm frond ribbon to remember them by. I kept it in my pocket as I relayed news of the agreement to viewers around the world.\n \n\n   \n  It’s sitting on my desk as I type this, 10 years later.\n \n\n   \n  It reminds me that the optimism and the urgency of that moment have not been forgotten.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/syrian-migrants-germany-repatriation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"08:39:00-05:00","title":"Syrian migrants in Germany face uncertain future as government floats repatriation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Germany is facing a major political and humanitarian debate over the future of its Syrian migrant population, as new Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his conservative coalition propose repatriation of Syrians, citing a shift in national policy and pressure from the far-right AfD party.

Approximately 1.3 million live in Germany currently, including 25,000 who were born there.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Chancellor Friedrich Merz and other conservatives in his coalition cabinet are calling for their repatriation.\n \n\n   \n  Merz this week said that Berlin would approach the issue in a “very concrete matter,” as he signaled that there are “no longer any grounds for asylum in Germany, and therefore we can also begin with repatriations.”\n \n\n   \n  While the German government will first and foremost encourage voluntary repatriation, Merz said those who refuse “can, of course, also be deported in the near future,” as he said that the return of Syrians to their homeland would be key to rebuilding the war-torn country.\n \n\n   \n  The German chancellor also revealed he has invited Syrian President  Ahmad al-Sharaa  to Berlin to discuss the issue.\n \n\n   \n  What’s changed in Syria is that the Assad government  is no more , bringing an end to years of civil war. And in Germany, Merz’s coalition is trying to fend off the far-right  Alternative for Germany (AfD)  party.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Merz’s rhetoric, it remains unclear at this stage how wide-reaching deportations would be. Germany has so far only announced plans to deport Syrians with criminal records.\n \n\n   \n  Since the collapse of Assad’s regime, around 1,300 Syrians – or 0.1% - have voluntarily returned to their homeland, according to Germany’s interior ministry.\n \n\n   \n  Syrians live in Germany under varying legal statuses – some have been granted German citizenship, while others hold permanent residence permits. Over 160,000 Syrians had obtained German citizenship by the end of 2023, Deutsche Welle reported. Those who fall into these categories will not need to leave Germany, CDU politicians said during a coalition debate on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands more hold temporary residence permits, which they are granted after receiving a protection status, such as asylum, refugee or subsidiary protection, which applies when neither of the former can be granted and serious harm is threatened in the country of origin.\n \n\n   \n  Temporary residence permits allow foreigners to live and work in Germany, as well as receive government benefits, but mean their ability to remain there is uncertain.\n \n\n   \n  The issue of repatriation is contentious and comes with significant legal hurdles. Meanwhile Syria remains scarred by years of conflict and nationals in Germany are looking on at the debate with mounting worry.\n \n\n   \n  “Merz’s comments are heading in a direction that fuels right-wing desires to deport anyone who doesn’t fit their so-called idea of who belongs in Germany and that’s terrifying,” said Rafif Dawoud, a 33-year-old architect living in Berlin, who migrated from Syria over 12 years ago and is now a German citizen.\n \n\n   \n  Dawoud said that while she knows people who have willingly returned, “talking about sending back people who have been trying to integrate, who see Germany as their second or even first and only home, who actively contribute to this society and economy, well that’s an absolute disgrace.”\n \n\n   \n  Others are concerned about a volatile political situation back home. A retired engineer, who currently lives in Germany but does not hold citizenship, described the overthrow of Assad’s government as a “historical necessity” while questioning its replacement.\n \n\n   \n  “We must ask whether the country is moving toward a state that mirrors European and specifically German values, respecting freedoms and human principles, or whether dictatorship and a new totalitarian religious system are simply being reproduced under a different name,” the man, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Since Assad’s ousting, Syria has  seen flare-ups  of deadly sectarian violence, with clashes erupting between security forces and those loyal to the former president, including in Syria’s coastal Latakia region in March.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN, Akram al-Bunni, a Syrian political activist who was jailed under Assad’s regime, said the German government must take into consideration the nature of the country’s new authority, which he believes could expose many Syrians to new persecution. The security situation must also be considered, al-Bunni said, stating that weapons remain “uncontrolled in the hands of extremist factions.”\n \n\n   \n  Johann Wadephul, Germany’s foreign minister and a politician in Merz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), hinted at some of the problems awaiting Syrians on a recent visit to  Damascus , when he compared the country’s devastation to “images we saw from Germany in 1945 after World War II” and expressed doubt that large numbers of Syrian migrants would return voluntarily.\n \n\n   \n  But after receiving backlash from within his own party over the comments, Wadephul has sought to stress that his overall view remains in alignment with his party.\n \n\n   \n  Other politicians, particularly on Germany’s left, have criticized the plans. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Lamya Kaddor, of Germany’s Green Party, said “to believe that mass deportations (to Syria) are now possible underestimates the reality on the ground.”\n \n\n   \n  The Association of German-Syrian Aid Organizations has spoken out against the government’s plans, with its chairman Nahla Osman saying the debate represents a huge blow for Syrians who have integrated into German society, including skilled workers, in a recent interview with Deutschlandfunk radio.\n \n\n   \n  Germany’s health sector, for example, employs over 6,000 Syrian doctors, according to official figures – making them an integral part of the country’s healthcare system. Late last year, then-Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned “whole areas” in Germany’s healthcare sector would fall away if the Syrians who worked there currently were to leave.\n \n\n   \n    Countering the far right\n \n\n   \n  Despite the opposition, it is clear that the days of “Wilkommenskulture” or “welcoming culture” regarding immigration to Germany under Merkel are gone.\n \n\n   \n  The  AfD  came second in Germany’s federal election in February, securing an unprecedented number of votes after campaigning on an anti-migration platform and a manifesto that states that “Islam does not belong in Germany.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the collapse of the Assad regime, the AfD has been calling for Syrians in Germany to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, the party has continued to enjoy strong popularity, even temporarily surging ahead of the CDU in some polls, leaving Merz’s government fighting to retain ground.\n \n\n   \n  Merz – who had long been a critic of Merkel’s open-door policies – has taken a tougher stance on migration, in part to counter the AfD.\n \n\n   \n  While his predecessor welcomed migrants into Germany under the slogan “Wir schaffen das” – “We’ll manage it,” Merz and his government  announced sweeping revisions  to migration policy after taking office.\n \n\n   \n  “We clearly did not manage it. That is exactly why we’re trying to fix it,” he said of the situation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/aca-enrollment-premiums-increase-impact","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Skyrocketing ACA premiums force enrollees to make tough decisions","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The expiration of enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act in 2026 is causing a surge in health insurance premiums—up 26% on average—forcing millions of Americans, especially those with preexisting conditions or low incomes, to make painful decisions.

Her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, told her that the monthly premiums for her Affordable Care Act policy  would soar  to $1,380 next year, up from $862.\n \n\n   \n  Wick, 57, currently gets $400 in  federal premium subsidies , which makes the monthly cost of her health insurance more manageable. But the Arlington, Texas, resident is not counting on that assistance for next year since she also received a letter from the federal Obamacare exchange saying she likely won’t be eligible for any help in 2026 if the enhanced subsidies expire as scheduled at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  The  rising health insurance rates  and lapsing subsidies could upend Wick’s life. A therapist who focuses on sexual assault survivors, she launched a full-time private practice earlier this year but depends on Obamacare coverage since she has preexisting medical conditions. However, having to pay three times her current tab is unaffordable and could force her to give up her practice and find a job that offers health benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “Health insurance will determine what my life will look like, whether or not I can continue with my private practice,” said Wick, who ruminates over the situation before she goes to sleep and when she’s out for her daily walks.\n \n\n   \n    Agonizing tradeoffs\n \n\n   \n  Wick is among the millions of Americans with Affordable Care Act policies who must contend with the looming lapse of the enhanced subsidies. The increased cost of coverage can lead to agonizing trade-offs for many enrollees, including cutting back on other necessities, trying to avoid getting care or forgoing health insurance entirely.\n \n\n   \n  The issue is  at the center  of the stalemate on Capitol Hill, which has led to a record federal government shutdown. Democrats say they will only support a federal funding package for fiscal year 2026 if it also extends the more generous assistance, but Republicans say they will only negotiate after the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  The enhanced subsidies have enabled many lower-income Americans to obtain coverage with no or very low monthly premiums and broadened eligibility for assistance to many middle-class consumers. Obamacare’s original subsidies, which are part of the 2010 health reform law and are not expiring, are only available to those who earn less than four times the federal poverty level, or about $63,000 for an individual and $129,000 for a family of four.\n \n\n   \n  Enacted by a Democratic-led Congress during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, the extra assistance helped spur a record 24 million people to sign up for Obamacare policies this year, with many new enrollees hailing from states that voted for President Donald Trump in 2024. More than 90% of policyholders receive subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The expiring beefed-up subsidies, along with rising health care costs, contributed to insurers hiking rates by 26%, on average, for next year, according to federal data.\n \n\n   \n  But what enrollees will actually pay will be far higher because they won’t have the additional aid. Premium payments will more than double, on average, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.\n \n\n   \n  Certain policyholders will be hit harder than others. Those with incomes just above the poverty level will go from paying $0 or nearly $0 in premiums to being on the hook for a few hundred dollars a year, said Cynthia Cox, KFF’s director of the Program on the ACA. Nearly half of enrollees are in this group.\n \n\n   \n  “For them, it’s a lot of money,” Cox said. “It may be a big enough increase that they feel they can’t afford it.”\n \n\n   \n  Also, enrollees in their 50s and early 60s, who already pay a lot for coverage, will have to shell out even more. An older couple making $85,000 a year could see their premiums skyrocket by more than $20,000 a year, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to imagine that many of them will be able to afford to continue that coverage,” Cox said.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the situation that Sunni Montgomery finds herself in.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I have fought this so hard. I want to live.’\n \n\n   \n  At 63, Montgomery is facing a relentless battle with lung cancer. Since 2022, she’s undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, relying on her ACA marketplace plan to cover the mounting costs. Thanks to enhanced subsidies, her premium this year was $541 a month — just manageable with Social Security Disability and a part-time job.\n \n\n   \n  But next year, without those subsidies, she says her premium is set to soar to $1,758 a month — far outside her budget.\n \n\n   \n  “I have to face the reality that I am probably going to become a late-stage cancer patient who’s uninsured,” Montgomery said. “I have fought this so hard. I want to live.”\n \n\n   \n  Now on daily oxygen and getting scans every three months, she says she’s at high risk for recurrence. Without insurance, those lifesaving treatments will be out of reach.\n \n\n   \n  “If I’m not getting scans and we don’t know if something’s recurred, then what that can mean is the end of me,” said Montgomery, who is racing to squeeze in every scan and checkup she can before her coverage expires.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Chris and Donna Vetter have made the agonizing decision to drop their health insurance, saying they simply cannot afford it.\n \n\n   \n  Chris, 62, is a retired federal worker, and Donna, 60, runs a small medical billing business. They relied on their ACA plan — reduced to $401 a month by the enhanced subsidies — to manage Donna’s asthma and Chris’ atrial fibrillation. But next year, their premium is set to skyrocket to $1,975 a month — nearly half their income.\n \n\n   \n  They pored over options on the ACA marketplace but say even the cheapest plans hovered near $1,000 a month. Yet those policies “have huge deductibles, big copays, and they don’t cover a lot, so effectively it’s like not having insurance anyways,” Chris said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Vetters, who live in rural Somerset County, Maryland, are bracing for a future without coverage — expecting to cancel appointments, forgo screenings, skip medications, and cross their fingers that disaster doesn’t strike.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just scared, and I don’t know what to do,” Donna said. “If anything should go wrong — God forbid a car accident, heart attack, cancer — we’ll have nothing.”\n \n\n   \n    Planning for the unexpected\n \n\n   \n  Soaring premiums have also left Alison and her husband, Chris, who live in Carson City, Nevada, debating over what to do about their Obamacare coverage. They began buying policies on the exchange three years ago, when Chris, a former police officer, had to retire after a serious injury.\n \n\n   \n  This year, they are paying only $183 a month after nearly $1,350 in subsidies. But next year, their policy will cost $936 after some subsidies. They are contemplating buying a less expensive plan with a much higher deductible, though that will force them to think twice about going to urgent care or the emergency room.\n \n\n   \n  “Just to even be in a situation where you have to think about, well, do I really need it? Do I really need that medication? Do I really need to go to the urgent care? God forbid, do I really need to go to the ER or can I, for lack of a better word, suck it up?” said Alison, who asked that only her first name be used because of her husband’s former profession. “I mean those are all decisions that we’re going to be forced to have to make.”\n \n\n   \n  Younger Americans are also grappling with the increased costs.\n \n\n   \n  Kris McKegney, 23, now pays $300 a month after subsidies for a higher-end plan with only a $3,000 annual deductible. Keeping the same plan would cost him $1,250 a month because he doesn’t expect to qualify for any assistance. That amount is out of the question, said the self-employed accountant.\n \n\n   \n  One option he’s considering is signing up for a $400-a-month catastrophic plan, which would require him to pay for all his medications, doctor visits and therapy appointments. Another is enrolling in a policy with an $850 monthly premium and a $10,000 deductible that would provide more coverage. But the latter would entail dipping into his retirement fund, pausing his efforts to save for a down payment on a house and raising rates on his clients, which are mostly nonprofit organizations.\n \n\n   \n  A Vermont resident, McKegney said health care is important to him because he is transgender. The battle on Capitol Hill over the enhanced subsidies, also known as advanced premium tax credits, makes him feel “degraded.”\n \n\n   \n  “The tax credits have helped millions of people access health care, and it seems very cruel to then take that away,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The enhanced subsidies’ looming expiration led Nolan LeRoux and Emily Clute to contemplate drastic measures to retain at least some assistance. The couple, both 35, were set to get married on Saturday but have considered not filing their license after the ceremony. That’s because they are more likely to qualify for Obamacare’s original subsidies as individuals than as a married couple — the income threshold for a couple is less than double that of a single person.\n \n\n   \n  Otherwise, the Bethlehem, New York, residents are looking at paying more than $1,360 per month next year for coverage, nearly double the total of what they’d pay as individuals for the same plan with some assistance. If the enhanced subsidies are extended, they would be eligible for more aid, even as a married couple.\n \n\n   \n  Since they aren’t comfortable going without insurance, the couple may end up working more to help cover the cost. He is a barber, and she is a tattoo artist. But they aren’t happy about having to spend more time apart as newlyweds to pay for higher premiums. What’s more, the higher tab would also weigh on their honeymoon plans, dampening any thought of going to California.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, though, the stress of not having health insurance would be greater than the concern of how to pay for it since anything could happen, like being hit by a drunk driver, LeRoux said.\n \n\n   \n  “There are not many things health care-wise that are particularly affordable,” he said. “It’d be a lot of stress because I don’t know exactly how we would pay for a medical bill that was in the five figures.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/ups-crash-fleets-grounded-investigation-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"08:05:00-05:00","title":"FAA halts flights of MD-11 cargo planes and requires inspections after UPS plane crash leaves community in mourning","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS MD-11 cargo plane crashed during takeoff from Louisville, Kentucky, killing at least 14 people and damaging nearby businesses, including Grade A Auto Parts.

Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    MD-11s grounded ‘out of an abundance of caution’\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, the cargo plane’s engine and the pylon, which supports the engine, fell off the left wing of UPS flight 2976 as it accelerated for takeoff, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have yet to determine why it happened, but operators are erring on the side of caution until answers emerge.\n \n\n   \n  “Out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of safety, we have made the decision to temporarily ground our MD-11,” UPS said in a statement. “Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.”\n \n\n   \n  McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft are used exclusively for cargo operations and make up about 9% of the UPS fleet. The company said it had contingency plans to temporarily operate without them.\n \n\n   \n  FedEx, the only other major US airline to operate the MD-11, will also ground them for “a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The decisions come after recommendations from Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997.\n \n\n   \n  The UPS freighter that crashed was a  34-year-old jet.  While that may be considered old for a passenger plane, that’s not so unusual in the world of air cargo and there are no initial indications that the age of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was in any way a factor in the  fatal crash .\n \n\n   \n    NTSB is still investigating the cause\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB will release a preliminary report within 30 days, but it could be 18 to 24 months before the investigation concludes, according to  Jim Brauchle , an aviation attorney with law firm Motley Rice and former US Air Force navigator.\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorders and the engine and pylon that fell off the airplane’s wing have been moved to a secure facility, where they are being examined, NTSB investigator Todd Inman said during a news conference Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The  engine was found lying on the ground  and will help investigators determine what may have caused the crash, according to CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s a huge clue and does give the (NTSB) a pretty good idea of what started this all off,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  The  engine coming off the plane  before the final impact and the fireball that followed suggest an “uncontained engine failure, meaning the engine spews out parts,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible pieces flying off of one failing engine could have impacted other key parts of the plane, and the engine likely ruptured the wing fuel tank when it ripped from the plane, she added.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have also recovered two hours of clear cockpit audio from the UPS cargo plane that confirmed the crew completed standard checklists and takeoff briefings, Inman said, before what he described what began as an “uneventful” takeoff roll.\n \n\n   \n  The transcript of the recording will be released to the public in several months, once most of the agency’s reports are completed, Inman said.\n \n\n   \n  Inman also confirmed the aircraft had recently undergone a heavy maintenance check in San Antonio, and clarified earlier reports of the plane reaching 475 feet were inaccurate. Data now shows the jet only climbed to about 100 feet above ground level before crashing.\n \n\n   \n  “The maintenance will be the big issue — what exactly was done to the aircraft, who did it, what parts were replaced, what procedures were followed, and who inspected the work,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators will be particularly interested in which engines or other parts may have been removed or replaced during maintenance, she added.\n \n\n   \n    A lawsuit has been filed on behalf of impacted victims and businesses\n \n\n   \n  Residents living near the crash site and local businesses facing significant economic losses who suffered emotional distress have filed a lawsuit against UPS, Boeing and General Electric.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs accuse the companies of recklessness and negligence, which “upended the lives and livelihoods” of many in the Louisville community, according to the complaint, filed in US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit alleges the Boeing McDonnell Douglas MD-11 crash was preventable and the defendants must be held accountable for the “trauma, fear and uncertainty” their actions have caused, according to the complaint, filed by the law firm Morgan & Morgan.\n \n\n   \n  A Boeing spokesperson told CNN the company has no comment about the lawsuit but said it is supporting NTSB’s investigation and extends its condolences to the families and friends of the victims.\n \n\n   \n  “Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved,” a UPS spokesperson told CNN. “We do not comment on pending litigation.”\n \n\n   \n  General Electric did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “This tragedy has needlessly shattered the lives of many in the Louisville community,” attorneys Mike Morgan, Rene Rocha, and Tanner Shultz said in a statement. “We are committed to uncovering the truth and will stop at nothing to achieve justice.”\n \n\n   \n  The suit also highlights the troubled safety record of Boeing’s MD-11 aircraft, calling it one of the most accident-prone commercial planes still in service. The filing cites past crashes, including a fatal 2009 FedEx MD-11 crash in Tokyo, and alleges similar design flaws or defects in Boeing’s MD-11 may have caused or contributed to the November 4 crash.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs argued UPS’ own modifications to convert the plane into a cargo model could have played a role. The complaint further points to GE’s CF6 engines, which have been involved in multiple catastrophic incidents, as another potential factor in the disaster.\n \n\n   \n    Loved ones of missing victims are losing hope\n \n\n   \n  The fire came first with a plume of red flames and black smoke twisting through the sunset. Then came the screams.\n \n\n   \n  Officials don’t believe it’s likely there are any more survivors, and the number of fatalities linked to the crash is expected to stand at 14, Mayor Craig Greenberg announced Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Search and rescue teams have located 13 victims, matching the number of missing persons reports related to the crash filed with police, Greenberg said in a video posted to  X . The 14th victim died at the hospital Saturday, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The plane crashed into Grade A Auto Parts, an automotive part and recycling facility, where three employees  are still unaccounted for. \n \n\n   \n  “It looked like really hell’s fury around her,” CEO Sean Garber recalled, describing a video he saw showing a “huge fireball” engulfing his business as his employees screamed and ran from the flames.\n \n\n   \n  Among the missing employees is John Loucks, a 52-year-old beloved uncle who worked on and off at Grade A Auto Parts for at least a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s scary really,” his nephew Justin Loucks told CNN. “Did he die on impact? Did he land in the woods somewhere?”\n \n\n   \n  “We were told (DNA testing) could take weeks or even longer,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Three crew members aboard the freight plane are believed to be among those found dead, Kentucky officials said. UPS identified them Thursday as Capt. Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Capt.

foreign leaders as GOP grapples with election losses and a shuttered government \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As Republicans were casting about for explanations for  their party’s dismal showing  in off-year elections last week,  President Donald Trump  had several other pieces of business to attend to.\n \n\n   \n  He hosted Central Asian leaders for dinner at the White House on Thursday. A day later, the 38th day of the government shutdown, Hungary’s authoritarian prime minister came for lunch. On Monday, Syria’s president will make a historic visit to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Among the topics the president spent time in public discussing last week: migration policies in Europe, commercial activity on the Caspian Sea, South Africa’s position in the G20, and the energy limitations presented by Hungary’s geography (“They don’t have the advantage of having sea,” he explained). He  hasn’t met  with congressional leadership about the record-long shutdown or offered any constructive solutions, instead digging in on the  filibuster elimination  that’s a nonstarter on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  Ten months into his new administration, Trump has placed much of his attention on foreign affairs as he works to end conflicts, secure trade agreements and burnish a presidential peacemaking legacy. World leaders pass through the White House weekly, and the president has made three foreign trips just since September.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an approach that’s yielded successes, particularly in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire the president helped broker in Gaza. But as Republicans look to improve their prospects a year out from critical midterm elections, even some of Trump’s allies are beginning to wonder whether his attention abroad is obscuring the “America First” identity he’s spent years building.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re not going to convince them to go to the polls and vote by bailing out Argentina. And you’re not going to convince them to go to the polls and vote by continuing to fund foreign wars and foreign countries and foreign causes,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said last week on CNN. “You’re going to get them to go to the polls and vote, when you show up to work, and actually fix the problems that they face every single day.”\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia Republican has of late become more critical of some of Trump’s tactics, though she still describes herself as a stalwart supporter. Yet she is hardly alone in questioning whether his attention might be better focused at home, and in particular on the economy, rather than on his endeavors overseas.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s having a lot of success with world leaders, and they all respect him,” one Trump adviser said. “He’s focusing where he’s successful. But people know it doesn’t motivate anyone to vote.”\n \n\n   \n  Even Vice President JD Vance said last week that domestic matters should be a priority.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to focus on the home front,” he wrote on X the day after the election, adding: “We’re going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that’s the metric by which we’ll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House said Trump remained focused on cost questions.\n \n\n   \n  “Addressing Joe Biden’s inflation crisis has been a Day One priority for President Trump, who has already lowered prices for essentials like gas and eggs and cooled inflation to an annualized 2.5 percent rate — half the average inflation rate under Joe Biden,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “As the Administration’s robust economic agenda continues taking effect, Americans can count on real wages continuing to increase, investments to make and hire in American continuing to flow in, and for Joe Biden’s lackluster economy to firmly become a distant memory.”\n \n\n   \n  A  CNN survey  released last week found only 1% of adult Americans named foreign policy as the most important issue facing the country; 47% said the economy and cost of living. Trump’s international efforts also did not receive high marks: 56% of respondents said his foreign policy decisions have hurt America’s standing in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the world stage has become something of a welcome respite for the president from the humdrum realities of governing in Washington. Last month in Asia, the president was met with extravagant welcomes, gold gifts and rapid-pace announcement of new trade and peace deals. It was a stark contrast to the atmosphere he left and returned to: gridlocked discussions to reopen the shuttered federal government and growing voter anxiety about an uncertain economy.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has argued Trump’s global efforts are intertwined with his domestic ambitions. His tariff regime, which forms the backbone of his foreign policy, is intended in part to restore American manufacturing and reduce the US trade deficit.\n \n\n   \n  But in many ways, the criticism from the president’s allies is not about policy but about the impression Trump is spending far more time meeting foreign leaders or flying around the world than he is attending to economic problems at home.\n \n\n   \n  “Keeping him on nonstop tours around the world and nonstop meetings with foreign countries’ leaders is not America First. It’s just not,” Greene said. “I think domestic policy should be the most important issue that the president and the Republican-controlled House and Senate are working on, and that showed up in the election on Tuesday.”\n \n\n   \n  It is not uncommon for presidents, in their second terms, to turn attention to foreign policy. Without the burden of another reelection campaign, leaders often have a freer hand to focus on issues not necessarily front of mind for voters. Diplomacy can also be an easier occupation for a lame-duck commander in chief than sweeping domestic efforts, which often require congressional buy-in.\n \n\n   \n  Presidential legacies are often forged in the drama of the world stage, such as Ronald Reagan demanding Mikhail Gorbachev tear down the Berlin Wall or Barack Obama making a historic visit to Cuba. Trump, too, views his peacemaking efforts as critical to his place in the history books, according to aides, and he openly jockeys for a Nobel Peace Price.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, however, the dynamics of his second term are different. He ran for president last year not as an incumbent, but as a challenger seeking to oust the sitting commander in chief. His campaign focused heavily on promises of an economic turnaround for struggling Americans, not the pursuit of a Nobel prize.\n \n\n   \n  When the candidate did make promises about foreign affairs, he often set the bar unattainably high. His pledge to end the war in Ukraine within a day of taking office proved impossible to meet, and he later claimed it was made facetiously.\n \n\n   \n  Since returning to office in January, Trump has hosted at the White House the leaders of Hungary, Ukraine, Argentina, Finland, Canada, Israel, Turkey, Poland, Korea, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Philippines, Bahrain, Congo, Rwanda, Pakistan, Germany, South Africa, Norway, Italy, El Salvador, Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, India, Jordan and Japan. Some have visited multiple times.\n \n\n   \n  He’s also convened summits of leaders from Europe, Africa and Central Asia, and gathered Arab and Muslim leaders at the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  This year, he’s traveled abroad to Italy, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Israel, Egypt, Malaysia, Japan and South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  While the pace of meetings and travel is steady, it does not put Trump on a more rapid pace than his predecessors, or even himself. During his first year in office in 2017, Trump received 35 heads of state for official visits. In 2013, the first year of Obama’s second term, 34 foreign leaders came to the United States for official visits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump visited 13 countries in 2017. And Obama visited 12 in 2013.\n \n\n   \n  President Joe Biden traveled at a slower pace during his first year in office, as the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic lingered, and in his final year, as he tried to turn attention to his reelection campaign. But the intervening years saw him visit roughly the same number of countries as Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Biden, too, struggled to balance domestic matters with the two foreign conflicts that came to consume the end of his presidency. And one point in 2023, he estimated 75% of his job was spent dealing with foreign leaders and traveling the world. Aides later blamed intensive foreign travel for the disastrous debate performance that precipitated his withdrawal from the race.\n \n\n   \n  Other presidents have also found that focusing abroad — at the expense of addressing Americans’ economic pain — yields little political return. George H.W. Bush oversaw the end of the Cold War and the first Gulf War, but voters were more concerned with high unemployment and inflation — a disparity his rival Democratic Bill Clinton seized upon when he ran and defeated him.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/russian-satellite-spying-explainer-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"04:20:00-05:00","title":"UK and Germany Accuse Russia of Threatening Their Satellites","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Germany and the United Kingdom have accused Russia and China of mounting a growing threat through space-based satellite espionage and interference, including stalking, jamming, and signal interception of military and commercial satellites. These actions, particularly involving Russian reconnaissance satellites near IntelSat satellites used by German and allied forces, have raised alarms about the security of satellite communications, navigation, and intelligence systems. Experts note that while Russia's capabilities are developing rapidly, its space systems remain less integrated and less reliable than those of China, which is seen as a more advanced and opaque threat. In response, Europe is significantly increasing investment in space defense, with Germany planning €35 billion over five years and the UK launching new detection systems.

Here’s what that means \n       \n  By Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Germany and the United Kingdom have warned of the growing threat posed by Russian and Chinese  space satellites , which have been regularly spotted spying on satellites used by Western powers.\n \n\n   \n  The countries have in recent weeks highlighted frequent instances of  Russia  stalking, jamming and interfering with their satellites in space.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s actions, especially in space, pose a fundamental threat to us all. A threat we can no longer ignore,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius  told a Berlin conference  of space industry leaders in September.\n \n\n   \n  Targeting communications satellites can impact things like satellite imagery, telecoms and broadband satellite internet access. Disrupting navigation and positioning systems can impact military operations as well as civil aviation, according to the global think tank RAND.\n \n\n   \n  The warnings come in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now well into its third year. Ukrainian officials say Moscow has increased its level of cooperation with China, with Beijing conducting satellite reconnaissance of Ukrainian territory on its behalf.\n \n\n   \n  Here is what officials and experts say about the satellite threats in space.\n \n\n   \n    What has Russia been doing?\n \n\n   \n  Pistorius noted that two Russian reconnaissance satellites were recently spotted tracking two IntelSat satellites, which are used by the German Armed Forces and its allies. IntelSat is a commercial satellite services provider whose fleet is used by governments and companies in the US and Europe.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia and China have rapidly expanded their space warfare capabilities in recent years: They can jam, blind, manipulate, or kinetically destroy satellites,” Pistorius added, announcing a multi-billion-dollar boost in funding for German space programs.\n \n\n   \n  The head of the UK Space Command also sounded the alarm, saying that Russian satellites are stalking British assets in space, as well as jamming them on a “weekly” basis.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve got payloads on board that can see our satellites and are trying to collect information from them,” Major General Paul Tedman told the BBC last month. Jamming is conducted using ground-based infrastructure. Russia has spent years developing electronic warfare capabilities amid the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte once again warned this year of Russia’s plans to develop  nuclear weapons in space  to disable and destroy satellites.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space. But Russia also vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called for member states to not develop space-based nuclear weapons in 2024. China abstained from voting.\n \n\n   \n    How does satellite ‘spying’ work and how is it detected?\n \n\n   \n  In general, it’s relatively simple for space forces to detect and locate foreign satellites, but it’s difficult to determine their exact capabilities and intentions.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities make assumptions about the intent of Russian satellites based on where the satellite is in space, what else it’s near and historical patterns of what similar satellites have done, according to expert Clayton Swope, the deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  For example, if a Russian satellite lingers for a long period of time near a European communications satellite, authorities can infer that it’s there to spy.\n \n\n   \n  Experts believe the Russian satellites that got close to the two IntelSat satellites used in part by Germany were there to intercept signals.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in lower orbits, Russian satellites have previously tested “things that look like weapons and fired projectiles,” Swope told CNN. Authorities can identify satellites that look similar to those equipped with projectiles to determine that they are a physical threat to other countries’ assets.\n \n\n   \n  “The Russians have a history of having those types of satellites shadowing other satellites in a way that people might think it’s a sleeper cell, waiting to strike at a moment’s notice,” Swope said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard to distinguish between a threat in the sense of a weapon and the threat in the sense of intelligence collection,” he added. “Sometimes you really are guessing a lot about what the capabilities of a satellite are as well as the intentions of the operator.”\n \n\n   \n  The Russian space agency has previously downplayed the danger of its weapons tests in space.\n \n\n   \n    How long has the threat from Russia existed?\n \n\n   \n  Germany and the UK are just the latest countries to sound the alarm. The United States and France first warned more than a decade ago that Russian satellites appeared to be spying and collecting information on their assets, including on commercially run satellites.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Defense said in 2015 that a Russian military satellite had parked itself near two Intelsat satellites, prompting the US to contact Moscow about its movements, which many at the time described as  “mysterious.” \n \n\n   \n  Then in 2017, after France and Italy jointly launched an intelligence satellite, Russian satellites were soon getting close to it to take a look, according to Juliana Suess, a security policy researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).\n \n\n   \n  “So, these kinds of behaviors are not entirely new, but I think also need to be seen in the context of Ukraine, and to be seen in the context of the  airspace violations  that we see Russia conducting with regard to NATO airspace,” Suess told CNN of the recent reports of satellite spying and interference. “All of these things ought to be seen in the broader context.”\n \n\n   \n    Is China also posing a threat?\n \n\n   \n  China is just as much of a threat as Russia, if not more so, experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Although the threats from Russia are more pressing for Europe due to their proximity, “the much bigger space power is obviously China,” Suess said. Analysts have noted some sophisticated Chinese maneuvers in space aimed at getting close to other satellites, “at just incredibly high speeds and with precision that I think has really raised some eyebrows in the West.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of China’s capabilities have raised international concerns, according to the SWP analyst. For example, China has tested a satellite with a robotic arm that can shift other satellites into a different orbit.\n \n\n   \n  China also has “a lot more money to conduct themselves in space,” Suess said. “We’re not going to see much more space growth out of Russia at the moment. Their resources are far too stretched for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s activities in space are very active and their objectives are more opaque, according to Swope, the CSIS analyst.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t always know what they’re doing, and they’re doing a lot of different things that leave a lot of people scratching their heads,” Swope added.\n \n\n   \n    Is the European response adequate?\n \n\n   \n  Germany said it will budget up to €35 billion ($40.2 billion) over the next five years for space projects.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a big number, for sure. I think it also reflects that there’s a sort of political will to now catch up and, you know, really get things going,” Suess said. But she also stressed that the space race is an ongoing process, with no finish line in sight. “Europe as a whole has a lot to catch up on. Germany certainly has a lot to catch up on.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the German Ministry of Defense told CNN that its procurement measures relating to space will amount to around €1.9 billion ($2.2 billion) in 2025, “but will grow significantly in the coming years.”\n \n\n   \n  The UK government also announced a commitment to increase defense spending this year and a  strategic review  of British capabilities outlined that “greater attention must be given to the space and cyber and electromagnetic domains.” The UK announced in October that it is testing sensors to detect laser threats in space as part of measures to protect British satellites.\n \n\n   \n  But an analysis from the London-based think tank  Chatham House argued  that even greater near-term investment is needed, and that the strategic review failed to recognize how urgent the threats in space truly are, putting the country at risk of falling behind.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, France has “been very vocal about the need to have what they refer to as ‘bodyguard satellites,’ so, satellites whose job it is to protect other satellites,” Swope said. What those satellites will look like is an open question, he added, with development ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  The US still has a historic advantage in space after investing much more in recent years, analysts said. But European allies may benefit from that through cooperation under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other alliances.\n \n\n   \n  NATO declared in 2019 that space is an “operational domain” for the transatlantic alliance and years later announced that Article 5 would apply in space.  Article 5  is the principle that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all members. Analysts at RAND have argued, though, that  NATO needs to “throttle up”  on its space enterprise or risk falling short at a critical time.\n \n\n   \n  While falling behind is a real concern, particularly compared to China’s advances, there is also evidence that the Russia has not integrated its satellite systems into its military infrastructure as well as many other space powers.\n \n\n   \n  Suess cited an example of a Russian fighter jet downed in Ukraine that was found with a built-in Russian navigation system but also a commercial GPS taped to the dashboard. Analysts have also seen evidence that Russia is procuring commercial satellite imagery from the private market – an indication that its own capabilities are not up to scratch.\n \n\n   \n  “We have seen from anecdotal evidence in Ukraine that Russia does not have some sort of level of confidence that one would typically expect in their own systems,” Suess added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/china/china-people-cafe-change-name-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"02:00:00Z","title":"Chinese Coffee Chain Changes Name After Criticism for Using 'People’s' Branding","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Chinese coffee chain named People’s Cafe faced widespread criticism from state media and the public for using a name and branding elements that closely resembled state institutions, particularly leveraging the politically significant term 'people' (renmin) used in China’s official name, currency, military, and party structures.

Is anyone buying it? \n       \n  Analysis by Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Federal Reserve’s newest policymaker has an unconventional perspective on the US economy that’s proving tough to sell.\n \n\n   \n  In September, President Donald Trump appointed Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to temporarily fill a vacated seat on the Fed’s powerful Board of Governors. So far, Miran has participated in two Fed meetings — and broken ranks with the vast majority of Fed officials each time.\n \n\n   \n  At the central bank’s October policy meeting, Miran dissented from Fed officials’ decision  to lower interest rates by a quarter point , backing a larger, half-point cut instead, just as he did in September.\n \n\n   \n  He hasn’t wasted any time to leave a first impression in other ways, too.\n \n\n   \n  In his first month as a central banker, Miran spoke publicly about the US economy at more than a dozen events and media interviews. Fed officials typically do only about a handful of public engagements in their first month.\n \n\n   \n  Like Trump, Miran has  repeatedly called for aggressive interest rate cuts . He has argued that borrowing costs are exerting more pressure on the economy than most think and that there’s “substantial disinflation” coming down the pike — views Miran proclaims as “out of consensus.”\n \n\n   \n  He reiterated his stance in a Wednesday interview with Yahoo Finance.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone is sold on Miran’s takes on the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “I certainly wouldn’t characterize anything that he’s saying as ridiculous,” David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura, said in an interview with CNN after he moderated a discussion with Miran in Washington, DC. “It’s more of a debate on the inputs that he’s putting into his economic modeling, which are controversial.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think only time will tell if he ends up being right,” Seif said.\n \n\n   \n    Miran’s takes\n \n\n   \n  Miran’s rationale for significant rate cuts is mostly based on how he views Trump’s sweeping economic policies and  his expectation that Trump’s tariffs won’t stoke inflation. \n \n\n   \n  In his first big speech after being sworn in as a Fed governor, Miran explained how Trump’s policies may be contributing to a lower “neutral rate of interest,” which is a theoretical level of borrowing costs that neither stimulates nor dampens the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  Miran specifically pointed to the administration’s aggressive crackdown on immigration, the president’s signature tax and spending bill passed by Congress earlier this year, and Trump’s widespread tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  In Miran’s view, that means the Fed has a lot of catching up to do to bring rates back to a more neutral level, and he believes time is of the essence.\n \n\n   \n  “If you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,” he told The New York Times in an interview that published on November 1. “I don’t see a reason to run that risk if I’m not concerned about inflation on the upside.”\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, Miran has said the ongoing mass deportations should take some pressure off the housing market, further lowering rates and resulting in “substantial disinflation.” He has also frequently downplayed the potential impacts of tariffs on consumer prices.\n \n\n   \n    Some pushback\n \n\n   \n  Miran, who earned a PhD in economics from Harvard University, is still widely seen as a serious economist, but his ideas have had some pushback.\n \n\n   \n  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was critical last month of Miran’s debut speech as a Fed governor.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot remember an analytically weaker speech given before the New York Economic Club or given by a Fed governor,” Summers told Bloomberg. “If this was the best case for the radical reduction in interest rates that President Trump has been advocating, then that case is even weaker than I had previously supposed.”\n \n\n   \n  Some Wall Street economists also haven’t been impressed by Miran’s takes.\n \n\n   \n  “We find some of his arguments questionable, others incomplete and almost none persuasive,”Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients in late September.\n \n\n   \n  Miran’s distinct economic reasoning also doesn’t seem to have gained traction with his colleagues on the Fed’s rate-setting committee.\n \n\n   \n  Like other Trump appointees, such as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, Miran agrees that a weaker labor market is at risk of falling off a cliff. But neither Waller nor Bowman have voted for a half-point rate cut, nor have they suggested that the neutral rate is lower than widely understood.\n \n\n   \n  Fed Governor Lisa Cook, in  her first speech since Trump said he fired her ,  was asked last week how she views the interaction between lower immigration and housing inflation, which is a cornerstone of Miran’s economic views.\n \n\n   \n  She subtly rejected that premise, stating “when I’m thinking about immigration, I’m typically thinking about the labor market.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think that that’s the major role that I see in immigration policy,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/trump-oval-office-event","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"19:24:00-05:00","title":"Images of Trump appearing to close his eyes during Oval Office event spread across social media","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Images of Donald Trump appearing to close his eyes during a public Oval Office announcement about reducing prices for weight-loss drugs went viral on social media, sparking criticism from opponents like California Governor Gavin Newsom, who labeled him 'Dozy Don.'

\nUpdated: \n        8:24 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Images of Donald Trump appearing to close his eyes at an Oval Office announcement this week rocketed around social media this weekend, with the president’s opponents seizing on the footage to raise questions about Trump’s on-the-job performance.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was participating in an announcement Thursday  about cutting prices  for popular weight-loss drugs, speaking from behind the Resolute Desk alongside other officials.\n \n\n   \n  At moments, Trump’s eyes appeared closed, and at others he seemed to struggle to keep them open. He rubbed his eyes at points.\n \n\n   \n  The images drew swift criticism from Trump’s critics. The press office for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the president’s top foils, posted images from the event and wrote: “DOZY DON IS BACK.”\n \n\n   \n  White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CNN that “the President was not sleeping; in fact, he spoke throughout and took many questions from the press during this announcement which represents a historic reduction in prices for Americans on two drugs that help Americans struggling with diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other conditions. This announcement by President Trump will save a significant amount of money and countless American lives, and yet the failing, liberal media want to push a garbage narrative instead of covering it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump appears in public regularly and participates in lengthy question-and-answer sessions with reporters. Aides and Cabinet members routinely praise his stamina and describe receiving phone calls or messages from him at all hours.\n \n\n   \n  A day before Thursday’s event, Trump traveled to Miami for an economic speech that lasted more than an hour. He also completed a three-nation swing through Asia at the end of last month.\n \n\n   \n  Still, questions about Trump’s health have persisted since he took office as the oldest man ever inaugurated to the job. The 79-year-old president said last month that  he received an MRI  during a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center without saying why.\n \n\n   \n  Over the summer, the White House announced that doctors examined Trump for swelling in his legs and  diagnosed him  with chronic venous insufficiency. It’s a condition in which valves inside certain veins don’t work the way they should, which can allow blood to pool or collect in the veins.\n \n\n   \n  All presidents, at moments, have appeared tired in public. Even a much younger president like Barack Obama would occasionally rub fatigued eyes during long summits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has harshly criticized former President Joe Biden for a lack of vigor, labeling him “Sleepy Joe” in last year’s election and continuing to use the moniker. Biden, the oldest president in history, was also seen at moments closing his eyes during public events.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/trump-administration-supreme-court-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"19:37:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court lets Trump pause full SNAP payments for now","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court, led by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, temporarily paused a federal lower court order requiring the Trump administration to fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for November, citing the need for further judicial review.

lets Trump pause full SNAP payments for now \n       \n  By Devan Cole, John Fritze, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:37 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover  full food stamp benefits  for tens of millions of Americans in November, siding with the administration on a short-term basis in a legal fight that has quickly become a defining confrontation of the  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The upshot is that the US Department of Agriculture will not have to immediately honor a lower court order that required it to transfer $4 billion to the key food assistance program by the end of the day. The decision, while temporary, could put at risk the full benefits for millions of Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to feed themselves and their families.\n \n\n   \n  The order does not resolve the underlying legal questions raised by the case – and the Trump administration has already committed to using the program’s contingency fund to partially pay benefits. Rather, Jackson’s “administrative stay” freezes any additional action by the administration to give an appeals court additional time to review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson is the justice assigned to handle emergency appeals from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n \n\n   \n  The legal fight over food stamps has emerged as a central pressure point between all three branches during the historically long government shutdown because it is one of the easiest to understand and most tangible impacts of that impasse so far. At stake is food assistance that nearly 42 million Americans rely on.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how the case will ultimately impact the billions of dollars spent in federal SNAP funding.\n \n\n   \n    Complying with the lower court\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s emergency request to the justices came hours after the USDA told states that it was  working to comply with the ruling to fully fund the program  that was issued a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island.\n \n\n   \n  This latest legal move has injected more uncertainty into whether food stamp recipients would see their full allotments anytime soon.\n \n\n   \n  The administration had made a similar emergency appeal to a Boston-based federal appeals court Friday morning, but the court had not yet weighed in by the time the USDA sent the guidance, which also said the process to make full funding for November available should be completed later on Friday. The appeals court, in a brief order Friday night, declined to put the payments on hold temporarily while it reviewed the case “as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the administration said, “Such a funding lapse is a crisis. But it is a crisis occasioned by congressional failure and one that can only be solved through congressional action.”\n \n\n   \n  “The district court’s ruling,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court, “is untenable at every turn.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration moved to appeal McConnell’s order after he ruled on Thursday that the government had to provide full SNAP benefits for November, instead of issuing only partial benefits as he had mandated days earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Rushing to fund full benefits\n \n\n   \n  Before the latest legal twist, several states had rushed to start issuing full SNAP payments to their residents. But that has caused problems, according to the administration’s filing to the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Sauer told the court that Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards. But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, Sauer said.\n \n\n   \n  These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, he continued. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “Today, in accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.”\n \n\n   \n  Other states have also promised beneficiaries would start receiving their full allotments as soon as Friday or over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania residents who should have already received their SNAP benefits this month will start seeing their full payments hit their electronic benefit transfer cards on Friday, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced at a press conference earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  “We are hoping that by this evening, by midnight or so, that all of those individuals who were owed money over the first week or so of this month, who hadn’t gotten it from the federal administration, are going to get their money,” Shapiro said.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that state officials continue to prepare for the Supreme Court’s ultimate decision. Meanwhile, residents who received their benefits are able to spend them.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the governors of Maryland and New York said beneficiaries could expect to start seeing their benefits over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in appropriations for the government.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling last week that the agency must at least tap into contingency funds to provide partial benefits for this month or, at its discretion, use other revenue to fully fund November’s allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The agency opted to  fund partial benefits , but warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell earlier this week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\n \n\n   \n  “People have gone without for too long,” McConnell said during a hearing Thursday. “Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  Under McConnell’s ruling, the government was required to transfer additional unused tariff revenue used to support child nutrition programs in order to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with more details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/sport/college-football-indiana-penn-state-miracle-catch","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"17:35:00-05:00","title":"Miraculous late toe-tap touchdown keeps No. 2 Indiana’s perfect season alive","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a dramatic finish, No. 2 Indiana football stunned Penn State with a miraculous 7-yard touchdown reception by wide receiver Omar Cooper Jr. in the final moments of a tightly contested game, securing a 27-24 victory and preserving their perfect 10-0 season.

Miraculous late toe-tap touchdown keeps No. 2 Indiana’s perfect season alive \n       \n  By Jacob Lev, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:35 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In need of a miracle, down four points with the clock quickly ticking down,  No. 2 Indiana  was looking their first loss of the season squarely in the eyes until wide receiver Omar Cooper Jr. played hero.\n \n\n   \n  The junior reeled in a seven-yard pass from quarterback Fernando Mendoza, just getting his foot in bounds to secure the 27-24 win over Penn State to keep their dream season alive in State College, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, improving to 10-0 on the season.\n \n\n   \n  The late dramatics came after it seemed like Indiana would have no issues getting the program’s first-ever win in Happy Valley, up 13 points in the third quarter.\n \n\n   \n  But with the intense Beaver Stadium crowd behind the home team despite its struggles all season, the Hoosiers found themselves in unfamiliar territory after Penn State rallied to make it a close game down the stretch.\n \n\n   \n  In the fourth quarter, the Nittany Lions took a 24-20 lead after quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer connected with Nicholas Singleton for a 19-yard score.\n \n\n   \n  Mendoza, a front-runner for the Heisman Trophy, had his “Heisman moment,” orchestrating a 10-play, 80-yard drive that led to the Cooper Jr. touchdown.\n \n\n   \n  The 22-year-old former University of California, Berkeley transfer finished the game with 218 yards, one touchdown throwing, another on the ground and an interception. Cooper finished with six receptions for 32 yards along with the score.\n \n\n   \n  “It was late in the game, I threw a pick, that’s on me. The team still had belief. The defense still had belief. Special teams had belief. This guy believed, he was open and I missed him a couple times,” Mendoza told the Fox broadcast while standing alongside Cooper Jr.\n \n\n   \n  “But it all came around in the end. … With amazing teammates and coaches for being able to rally and get the win here in a hostile environment against a great team.”\n \n\n   \n  The Nittany Lions were unsuccessful in finding a miracle for themselves as a late second Hail Mary attempt fell short. The storied Penn State program now drops to 3-6 with a 0-6 record in Big Ten conference play this season.\n \n\n   \n  The Penn State program came into the season ranked No. 2 in the national with championship aspirations under then-head coach  James Franklin  following a semifinal appearance in the College Football Playoff last season.\n \n\n   \n  However, the school fired Franklin last month after early season struggles that found the program sitting at 3-3. Now, under interim coach Terry Smith, the Nittany Lions are riding a six-game losing streak with three games remaining on the season.\n \n\n   \n  Indiana will host Wisconsin next week while Penn State heads to East Lansing, Michigan, to take on Michigan State.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/europe/pope-leo-meets-abuse-survivors-belgium-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"15:32:00Z","title":"Pope Leo holds hours-long ‘profound and painful’ meeting with abuse survivors","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, held a three-hour meeting with 15 survivors of clerical sexual abuse in Belgium, described as 'profound and painful' by the Holy See.

These are some of the biggest password blunders \n       \n  By Charlotte Reck, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A 2014 security report resurfaced this week showing that the password for the server managing the CCTV network at the Louvre – Paris’ art museum which suffered immense financial loss after a  heist team  successfully  targeted historical jewels  last month – was, in fact, just  “LOUVRE.” \n \n\n   \n  But predictable passwords like these are concerningly common.\n \n\n   \n  Logging into social media accounts, shopping apps and subscriber platforms can be a laborious task that leaves many launching devices across the room in frustration and asking why it’s necessary to hire a crack team just to access a personal account.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps it’s time to consider the demand for 16-character combinations of letters, numbers and symbols to be more method than madness, and learn from the mistakes of the weak-password-makers who’ve gone before.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some examples of technological mishaps and infamous faux pas(swords):\n \n\n   \n    Colonial Pipeline blunder:\n \n\n   \n  In May 2021, one of the largest fuel pipeline systems in the United States was  paralyzed  when a cyberattack brought operations to an abrupt halt. At the time, the FBI said the hackers responsible belonged to criminal group Darkside, believed to be based in Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Colonial Pipeline said its network had been accessed via a compromised password that was linked to a disused virtual private networking account used for remote access. The account was not guarded by an extra layer of security known as multi-factor authentication.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how the attackers obtained the compromised credential. But the company claimed the password in question was not easily guessable, with CEO Joseph Blount telling a US Senate committee in June 2021:”It was a complicated password, I want to be clear on that. It was not a Colonial123-type password.” The shutdown remained in place until the company complied with a ransom demand, paying $4.4 million to end the attack.\n \n\n   \n  By the following year, the FBI had  recovered millions  of dollars extorted from Colonial Pipeline by Darkside.\n \n\n   \n    Zero chance forgetting the nuclear launch code:\n \n\n   \n  According to Bruce Blair, a former Air Force launch officer and nuclear policy expert, between 1962 and the mid-1970s the most powerful digits on the globe were simple – eight zeros.\n \n\n   \n  In a twist as absurd as Peter Sellers’ president declaring the War Room a place where gentlemen must not fight in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 dark comedy “Dr. Strangelove,” Blair claimed just eight zeros separated the US from launching a nuclear attack.\n \n\n   \n  Blair said a “two-man-rule,” which required two qualified crew members to be present at the location of the launch code, was considered the primary human safeguard, but the measure wasn’t always reliable. According to Blair, the two members on shift would often organize alternative sleeping rotas that left just one individual with a straightforward password and all the power.\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, the Strategic Air Command amended the system to include a unique enable code that transmitted to the launch crew from a higher authority. The change added further security steps to the process and, as Blair  said , “It no longer sufficed just to flip one switch.”\n \n\n   \n  The nuclear expert’s shocking revelation came decades after it was decided that solely punching in eight zeros might be a little lax when it comes to initiating nuclear war.\n \n\n   \n    A 158-year-old business tanked by hackers:\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of jobs were lost when an unsuspecting transport company in eastern England was toppled by a hacking gang, British media reported.\n \n\n   \n  Northamptonshire business KNP was targeted in June 2023 by Akira, a group of hackers who gained access to the company’s system by guessing the password of an employee. Once inside, the hackers encrypted KNP’s data and locked its internal systems before demanding a ransom.\n \n\n   \n  Being unable to make the payment, the company’s data was lost, and the 158-year-old business went under.\n \n\n   \n  KNP’s director Paul Abbott admitted he never told the employee with the weak password that it was their information that was compromised and likely led to the company’s demise. “Would you want to know if it was you?” Abbott  told the BBC .\n \n\n   \n    Phone hacking scandal:\n \n\n   \n  Hugh Grant, Prince Harry and Sienna Miller were among the stars who fell victim to  phone hacking  during a scandal perpetrated by British tabloids that spanned several years.\n \n\n   \n  Formal inquiries began after complaints that personal information shared only in private realms was routinely exposed on the front pages of national newspapers, causing distress and compromising the safety of those targeted.\n \n\n   \n  Investigations found the voicemails of public figures were hacked by journalists and private investigators hired by publications who worked on the assumption that few people changed the default voicemail access code their handset came with. Simple combinations like 1111, 4444 and 1234 were used to gain access to the messages waiting in the inbox.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom’s phone-hacking scandal led to the closure of the News Of The World’s in 2011, followed by an inquiry into the practises and ethics of the British press.\n \n\n   \n    A one-time hacker now an opposition party leader:\n \n\n   \n  As head of the opposition, the UK’s Conservative Party leader  Kemi Badenoch  spends a lot of time critiquing the current British government. But her record isn’t squeaky clean.\n \n\n   \n  Back in 2018, the politician confessed to hacking the official website of Labour peer Harriet Harman a decade earlier and changing the content to be pro-Conservative.\n \n\n   \n  But this was no mastermind crime – the password required to edit Harman’s website was, indeed, “Harriet Harman.”\n \n\n   \n  Badenoch, who was not a lawmaker at the time of the hack, has since apologized for what she called a “foolish prank.”\n \n\n   \n    Personal data of millions of UK voters vulnerable:\n \n\n   \n  From August 2021 through to 2022, cyber attackers gained access to computers containing Electoral Registers – lists of names and addresses of millions of voters across the UK, the country’s data privacy watchdog discovered.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said hackers accessed the system by imitating a legitimate user account. The ICO determined this possible because appropriate security measures were consistently missed.\n \n\n   \n  Software designed to fix security holes was not installed, and the company failed to enforce a policy that ensured employees used secure passwords. During inquiries, the ICO found 178 active email accounts using passwords identical or similar to those set by the organization’s IT desk when the account was activated.\n \n\n   \n  The Electoral Commission was formally reprimanded for their negligence. No evidence of data misuse was reported.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/weekend-travel-flight-cuts-government-shutdown-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"10:52:00.000-05:00","title":"Travelers Face Mounting Delays This Weekend as Airlines Cut Hundreds of Flights Due to Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A prolonged government shutdown in the United States has led to widespread flight cancellations and delays across the U.S. and internationally.

mounting delays this weekend as airlines cut hundreds of flights due to the shutdown. Here’s what to know \n       \n  By Emma Tucker, Pete Muntean, Hanna Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:52 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Disgruntled travelers across the US will face more disruptions to their plans this weekend, as airlines cancel hundreds of additional flights and delays continue to mount due to air traffic controller staffing shortages amid a government shutdown with no end in sight.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,700 flights have been canceled from Friday through Sunday, data from Cirium shows, as airlines start to implement a 4% reduction in domestic flights at 40 of the busiest airports mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n \n\n   \n  But the cuts – which officials say are aimed at keeping air travel safe while some of the air traffic controllers and federal security screeners missing paychecks are not showing up to work – haven’t prevented thousands of hourslong delays that have left flyers scrambling to figure out how to get to their destinations.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t want to be stranded at the airport sleeping on a bench,” Michele Cuthbert of Columbus, Ohio, told   The Associated Press , expressing concern about possible flight cancellations ahead of her trip to Dallas.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next week, airlines will ramp up flight cancellations to 10% by next Friday if the government shutdown remains unsolved. And the shutdown will likely disrupt holiday travel plans if no deal is reached after next week, plunging flyers into “uncharted territory,” said former FAA deputy administrator Dan Elwell.\n \n\n   \n  But travelers can still see flight cuts even if the government were to reopen next week, as the FAA’s order requires airlines to cancel flights days in advance.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know if you plan to travel by air in the coming days:\n \n\n   \n    Why is the FAA ordering flight cuts?\n \n\n   \n  An emergency order by the FAA on Thursday said airlines have to cut traffic by 4%, resulting in about 800 flight cancellations for Friday that increased to over 1,000 throughout the day, according to FlightAware.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, there were more than 1,500 flight cancellations and over 6,600 delays, according to the flight tracking website. More than 1,000 flights have already been canceled for Sunday and over 240 delayed, the data show.\n \n\n   \n  The disruptions are primarily caused by air traffic controller staffing and the FAA order, but also include unrelated flight cuts.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines will be required to cut 6% of their flights to those 40 airports on Tuesday, 8% Thursday and 10% next Friday if the shutdown drags on, the FAA says.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage could rise to 15-20% if the gridlock in Congress doesn’t end “relatively soon,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned in an interview with Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to very much disrupt their Thanksgiving travel plans, I’m sure,” Elwell said about the flight cuts. “And let’s just hope we don’t get there.”\n \n\n   \n  Elwell, who served in the first Trump administration, said flight delays caused by the second-longest government shutdown starting in 2018 “actually brought people back to the table and ended the shutdown back in 2019.”\n \n\n   \n    Why are some air traffic controllers not showing up to work?\n \n\n   \n  The effects of air travel disruptions resulting from the shutdown will likely linger even if Congress makes a deal to reopen the government, as the  transportation secretary says  air traffic controllers may not return to work right away.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA said air control facilities nationwide were short-staffed 42 times on Saturday, according to an operations plan. And problems continue despite the flight cancellations designed to relieve stress on controllers struggling to deal with the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Aaron Barker, an employee of the Transportation Security Administration and leader of the American Federation of Government Employees Union, said neither he nor his colleagues are able to make ends meet during the shutdown as controllers miss a second full paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now at the point where today would have been a payday for officers,” he told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on Saturday. “So now I have members who are coming — they’re being evicted. Some of them are already evicted. I have one family who I just learned was sleeping in their car with children.”\n \n\n   \n  More flight reductions – intended to reduce flow and maintain safety – mean the number of air traffic controllers not showing up for work will continue to rise, Elwell said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re going to have to make hard financial decisions,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    What airlines have canceled flights this weekend?\n \n\n   \n  Major airlines have announced further cancellations to hundreds of flights scheduled through the weekend after more than 1,000 were slashed on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines will cut 220 flights from its schedule through Monday, a spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, United Airlines announced hundreds of cuts through early next week, including 168 on Saturday; 158 on Sunday; 190 on Monday and 269 on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Southwest Airlines will cancel about 100 flights Saturday and 150 Sunday to comply with the FAA order, saying in a statement the carrier has already reduced its schedule by 4% through Monday at 34 of the 117 airports it serves.\n \n\n   \n  The vast majority of Southwest flights, however, will not be disrupted, said the airline, which is contacting affected customers directly.\n \n\n   \n  More than 140 Delta and 140 Delta Connection flights have also been canceled. “Additional cancels for Sunday can be expected,” the airline said in a  news release .\n \n\n   \n    How can I get around flight disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  Major airlines like American, Delta, Southwest, United and Frontier are all waiving fees for passengers who want to change their tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Airline officials like Frontier’s CEO Barry Biffle are urging people to book a separate, backup ticket on another carrier if they don’t want to risk being stranded when their flight is canceled.\n \n\n   \n  Try to mitigate any headaches from delays and cancellations by avoiding booking flights with layovers, nonprofit  US Public Interest Research Group  says, and opt to make reservations directly with the airline rather than a third-party website.\n \n\n   \n  Other useful tips for travelers include proactively checking your flight status in case airlines don’t send out alerts; paying for flight disruption coverage or travel insurance with a credit card; and knowing you’re entitled to a full cash refund if your domestic flight is canceled or delayed over three hours, according to guidance from Brian Kelly, founder of travel website The Points Guy.\n \n\n   \n    What airports are seeing flight delays and cancellations?\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s busiest airports were hit hardest as the shutdown’s ripple effects spread across nearly every part of the air travel network on Friday – the first day of the Trump administration’s mandatory cuts to reduce US air traffic – and continue into the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  The three major airports servicing the New York City area are experiencing hourslong delays on Saturday due to staffing shortages, according to the FAA.\n \n\n   \n  A ground stop was temporarily issued for flights traveling to Newark Liberty International Airport Saturday after the FAA noted flights into the airport were delayed an average of over four hours earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  Flights coming into LaGuardia Airport were delayed nearly an hour, while departures were also delayed an average of 75 minutes and increasing. And those headed to John F. Kennedy International Airport are delayed an average of over 2.5 hours, while departures from the airport are currently delayed an average of 105 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, flights arriving at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport are delayed an average of five and a half hours, the FAA said.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Washington, DC’s Reagan National Airport faced the most severe disruption, with nearly 80 flights canceled and almost half of all arrivals delayed, according to tracking site  FlightAware .\n \n\n   \n  Chicago O’Hare, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International, Denver International and Dallas-Fort Worth also experienced dozens of cancellations and hundreds of delays, FlightAware data show. On the West Coast, Los Angeles International and San Francisco International reported similar issues.\n \n\n   \n  Other affected airports include Boston Logan, Phoenix Sky Harbor, Seattle-Tacoma and Orlando International, all reporting slowdowns heading into the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Internationally, major hubs like Amsterdam Schiphol, Toronto Pearson and Tokyo Haneda, saw cancellations climbing into the double digits.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/americas/brazil-tornado-weather-parana-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"17:35:00-05:00","title":"Unprecedented tornado tears through southern Brazil, killing at least six","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful and unprecedented tornado devastated the town of Rio Bonito do Iguaçu in the state of Paraná, Brazil, killing at least six people and injuring over 750.

\n        4:06 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The happy hour regulars were already gathering at Stooges Bar & Grill less than two hours before tip-off at Tuesday night’s University of Kentucky men’s basketball season opener.\n \n\n   \n  About 30 or so customers occupied the wooden stools of the old-school, salty hangout in an industrial strip a few miles from downtown Louisville. Only the University of Louisville Cardinals draw a larger pregame crowd.\n \n\n   \n  Surrounded by big-screen TVs and signs for the domestic beer buckets and other specials, the no-frills, family-owned watering hole near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport is popular among workers from the nearby United Parcel Service package handling facility and the Ford SUV assembly plant.\n \n\n   \n  For the Kentucky opener, Stooges was offering 59-cent shrimp all day.\n \n\n   \n  “I had just ordered my first beer and the lights went out,” Stooges regular Bryson Beck recalled.\n \n\n   \n  Kyla Kenady, working that afternoon, handed him a beer, turned around and looked outside to see “a plane in flames going down.”\n \n\n   \n  The  first report  of the “catastrophic” crash of a UPS MD-11 plane was at about 5:15 p.m. ET on Tuesday, according to state officials. The disaster killed  at least 14 people  and  destroyed nearby businesses  and buildings.\n \n\n   \n  “This plane barely missed a restaurant/bar,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear told CNN. “It was very close to a very large Ford plant with hundreds, if not a thousand-plus workers.”\n \n\n   \n  The randomness of the disaster has left locals in a state of shock.\n \n\n   \n  Debbie Self, who, along with her late husband Rodger, opened Stooges more than 40 years ago, said firefighters told her the plane came down roughly 100 yards from her business.\n \n\n   \n  “It was close. They said, ‘We don’t know how you made it,’” said Self, who was having dinner elsewhere at the time of the crash.\n \n\n   \n  The UPS cargo plane came down after an engine detached during takeoff, officials said. Investigators clarified Friday that their earlier report the plane had reached 475 feet was inaccurate, noting data now shows the jet only climbed about 100 feet above ground level before crashing.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to three UPS crew members identified from the plane, nine members of the community have been reported missing, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. They were believed to be in the area at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The crash left a fiery trail of destruction and a half-mile-long debris field, devastating multiple small businesses, such as Grade A Auto Parts, where mangled, blackened remnants of buildings were set in the background of what a Kentucky official described as an “apocalyptic” ashy sky with an acrid smell in the air.\n \n\n   \n  As flames raged and doors melted shut,  people jumped from windows and ran,  some employees helping shield others from the growing inferno at the recycling plant, according to its owner.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene showed a mountainous plume of charcoal-colored smoke emanating from buildings that were set ablaze. In another video at the facility, a man yelled, “Did everybody make it out?” When another person responded, “No,” he screamed, “What do you mean no?”\n \n\n   \n  “I thought it was the end of the world,” Robert Sanders, a 50-year-old employee at the plant told CNN. He lived in a RV trailer on the site of the facility and believes it was destroyed along with all his personal belongings.\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the crash showed a towering wave of smoke and flames billowing skyward near the airport after the low-flying plane struggled to climb and then erupted into an enormous fireball on impact.\n \n\n   \n    Stooges’ parking lot is now a temporary morgue, owner says\n \n\n   \n  At Stooges, Kenady went into “fight or flight” response. The burning plane appeared to fly right over the volleyball courts in the parking lot.\n \n\n   \n  “I turned around, ran down the bar and screamed to everyone that a plane was crashing, grabbed my things, grabbed my phone, my purse, ran out the door as everyone, in panic, ran out at the same time,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  She got into her car and, across the street, felt the ground shaking and what she said was a terrifying rush of heated air.\n \n\n   \n  It was a horrific scenario Kenady said had crossed her mind before. The roar of the planes on takeoff is so loud that people normally have to pause their conversations in the bar.\n \n\n   \n  “We think that something like that would happen but you don’t ever think it would happen to you,” she said of the disaster.\n \n\n   \n  Beck, the bar customer, did not get past his first beer. The lights went out, then he heard “the biggest boom.” The building shook.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been in earthquakes in California before and it didn’t hold a candle to how this place shook,” he said. “Everybody started freaking out and then there’s more booms.”\n \n\n   \n  Beck ran outside. A thick cloud of black smoke enveloped the afternoon sky. “I thought that maybe a country was bombing us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He ran into a friend, who wanted to rush to the crash scene to help.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not firefighters. We’re not first responders. We don’t have gear,” Beck told his friend. “We have to leave.”\n \n\n   \n  If the plane had gone down a few hundred feet from where it crashed, Beck said, “I would not be talking to you right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Stooges has been in operation since 1984, according to an  obituary  for Self’s husband, who co-founded the business with her.\n \n\n   \n  “Please join us in praying for the victims, their families, and all of the brave first responders,” Self wrote on the  bar’s Facebook page. \n \n\n   \n  “I do believe Rodger shielded that place and all inside, wrapping his angel wings around it,” a local commented on Facebook, referring to Stooges and Self’s late husband.\n \n\n   \n  Another Louisville bar has offered temporary jobs to Stooges employees who are now out of work, according to Self, who has also started a fundraising campaign for her more than 40 employees.\n \n\n   \n  “We were very fortunate. Others were not so fortunate,” Self said.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of the crash, Self said she was having dinner about three miles away from Stooges. She got a call from a worker and rushed to the bar but could not get close.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought it would be gone,” she said of Stooges. “I can’t believe it survived. From now on it will always be known as a place that was left intact in the middle of a war zone.”\n \n\n   \n  Stooges appears to be undamaged but Self said she is unsure when it will reopen. Its parking lot, usually a venue for wrestling matches and volleyball games, is now a temporary morgue.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/sport/baseball-mlb-vesia-dodgers-world-series","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"10:06:00-05:00","title":"After Missing World Series for Personal Reasons, Dodgers’ Vesia Says His Baby Daughter Has Died","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Alex Vesia, a relief pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, missed the 2025 World Series due to a deeply personal family matter, which he later revealed was the death of his daughter, Sterling, who passed away on October 26, 2025.

Ayushi Shah, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:53 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The ritual begins, as it always does, with a pilgrimage.\n \n\n   \n  People pour in from the dense warrens of India’s financial capital and from dusty villages thousands of kilometers away, all flowing towards the fortified, sea-facing Mumbai home of actor Shah Rukh Khan.\n \n\n   \n  The crowd is a mix of teenagers angling for a glimpse of the icon inside; middle-aged women for whom he was a first love; grown men who see their own aspirations mirrored in his trajectory.\n \n\n   \n  Known as “SRK” by millions, and “King Khan” to his fans, he turned 60 last week, and the chaotic display of devotion outside his home is a testament to a level of stardom rarely seen elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  The air is thick with chants celebrating his milestone. Some have waited overnight. They don masks or T-shirts with his face on, or clutch posters of his movies. All are here for the same sacrament: to get a glimpse of the superstar and be included in the sweep of his signature open-armed embrace.\n \n\n   \n  “I have loved him for a long time so I have come here to wish him happy birthday,” one fan told a local news agency. “Happy, happy birthday Shah Rukh brother. Happy birthday to you.”\n \n\n   \n  Another said he comes here every year. “I’ve been a fan of him since I was born… I have watched all his films,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  This bond was forged in a bygone era. As India opened its economy to the world in the 1990s, Khan opened its heart. He was an outsider who stormed the dynastic gates of Bollywood with little more than wit, ambition, and dimples that could disarm a subcontinent.\n \n\n   \n  And while the adoring thousands gather outside his home to worship a film deity, they may also be witnessing the twilight of India’s cinematic gods.\n \n\n   \n  “As stars become more relatable and fandom less devotional, the star-fan contract is less sacrosanct today,” said a recent IMDb report analyzing the last 25 years of Indian cinema.\n \n\n   \n  In today’s fractured attention economy of streaming, the barbed wire of polarizing politics, and the cacophony of social media, winning adoration on this scale isn’t just difficult; it might be impossible.\n \n\n   \n  As the IMDb report put it: “It’s time to stop searching for the next Shah Rukh Khan.”\n \n\n   \n  In 1991, the government dismantled the protectionist economic policies of its socialist past, cracking open the nation to the world. It was a policy shift that ignited a period of economic growth and industrial expansion that essentially reshaped the country. Satellite television brought a plethora of choice into the living room, Western brands began to appear in shops and, for a burgeoning middle class, the definition of success was suddenly rewritten.\n \n\n   \n  An exhilarating mantra became mainstream: Anyone can make it.\n \n\n   \n  Into this moment stepped Khan.\n \n\n   \n  A Muslim boy from a middle-class Delhi neighborhood, Khan says he was shaped by a household rich in intellect but often short on cash.\n \n\n   \n  His father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was a lawyer and Indian independence activist from Peshawar, in modern-day Pakistan, who ran a series of failed businesses. His mother, Lateef Fatima, was the family’s anchor, according to the younger Khan.\n \n\n   \n  “I come from a very normal lower-middle-class family. I saw a lot of failure,” he  said  during a 2012 speech at Yale University. “My father was a beautiful man and the most successful failure in the world… We were quite poor actually and let me tell you… poverty entails fear and stress and sometimes depression.”\n \n\n   \n  He began acting in school plays. By the age of 23, he was already on television in the successful series “Fauji” (Soldier). But just as his career was taking flight, his personal world fell apart.\n \n\n   \n  The death of his mother, years after he lost his father, prompted a move to Mumbai, the heart of India’s film industry.\n \n\n   \n  “I was sad in Delhi,” Khan told CNN in a 2008 interview. “I said to myself: OK, come (to Mumbai) for a change of scene. Maybe I’ll enjoy myself for a year and get over my depression of my parents’ death. But I just I couldn’t go back… I was never trying to be a movie star, I became one by chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Khan made his big-screen debut in the 1992 romantic drama “Deewana” (Obsessed) and soon became known for playing villainous, menacing characters in films like “Darr” (Fear) and “Baazigar” (Gambler). But it was his pivot to the romantic hero in the 1995 cult hit “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” (The Brave Hearted Will Take the Bride, widely known as DDLJ) that catapulted him to superstardom.\n \n\n   \n  His character, Raj, presented a new model of masculinity that wasn’t the angry young man of the previous generation. He was the empathetic partner for the new one, offering a vision of modern love that felt safe and aspirational.\n \n\n   \n  Bollywood certainly has other megastars, like Deepika Padukone, who is among India’s most celebrated women actors; Aamir Khan, known for his versatility; and Salman Khan. Yet, their followings are distinct from the quasi-religious fervor thar surrounds Khan.\n \n\n   \n  It is a phenomenon of near-mythic proportions, engendering a devotion so profound as to lead to the scenes of mass pilgrimage outside Khan’s Mumbai home.\n \n\n   \n  Sher Mohammed had traveled 2,200 kilometers from his village in the eastern state of Jharkhand and waited 95 days for a chance to meet Khan. When Khan learned of Mohammed’s determined vigil, he came out to the street to personally greet his fan.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone told me I won’t be able to meet him… I got even more motivated to meet him,” Mohammed said. “I felt so happy.”\n \n\n   \n  Also present was Visharukh, Khan’s self-proclaimed “biggest fan,” whose home is plastered with posters of the actor, and whose children are named “Simran” and “Aryan” – after Khan’s love interest in “DDLJ” and his real-life son, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Visharukh’s shrine to Khan is just one thread in an intricate tapestry of fandom.\n \n\n   \n  In her book, “Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh,” author Shrayana Bhattacharya explores what he means to women as someone who challenged masculinity in a newly liberalized economy.\n \n\n   \n  “For 15 years, I thought I was talking to fans about Khan,” she said. “Eventually, he became a research device for hundreds of his female fans to use his icon to talk about their own frustrated attempts to assert economic and emotional independence in one of world’s most insidious patriarchies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Bhattacharya, there is no single explanation for his appeal.\n \n\n   \n  For a migrant tribal domestic worker, for instance, she found the appeal wasn’t rooted in grand romance. She most appreciated his characters’ willingness to participate in domestic life, Bhattacharya said, citing “simple gestures such as being in the kitchen in his films, helping with chores.”\n \n\n   \n  For the nation’s elites, Bhattacharya found Khan symbolized something entirely different. He was a living embodiment of the dream that hard work could lead to limitless success. He represented, as she put it, “the myth of meritocracy at a time when India started its love affair with GDP growth and consumer spending.”\n \n\n   \n  And for another crucial group – the first generation of women to ever work in their families – she found his films offered a vital refuge. Khan’s imagery became a “necessary entertainment and escape when their everyday rebellion of prioritizing a career over marriage caused heartbreak or exhaustion,” Bhattacharya said.\n \n\n   \n  “He is one person, but each fan has projected their aspirations and fantasies onto him in their own unique and deeply diverse ways.”\n \n\n   \n  But in today’s world of digital creators, those seeking fame face competition in a way Khan’s generation never could have imagined.\n \n\n   \n  This new reality is the daily grind for Shivam Khatri, an aspiring actor in Mumbai. He, too, left his small town for the city of dreams, but his hustle operates in a different universe. For him, the formula has been inverted: where Khan became a star and then a brand, actors now must become a brand first.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like someone gets picked up from the street,” Khatri said from the home he shares with several other people. “Social media, web shows, it’s changed everything.”\n \n\n   \n  The influence of stardom in India is immense. Cultivated over years through a series of box-office hits, it can define eras, create cultural touchstones, and command a loyal fanbase that transcends generations.\n \n\n   \n  But the very nature of the connection between stars and their audience is now evolving, according to the IMDb report.\n \n\n   \n  “What was once a carefully mediated connection, built through iconic characters and controlled narratives, has become more porous,” it said. “The closing of the metaphorical gap between the big screen’s larger-than-life star and the one on the (Instagram) reel you can hold in your hand has changed the equation between the star and the fan.”\n \n\n   \n  Khatri knows his follower count is as important as his headshot as he competes not just with actors but with food bloggers, comedians and dancers for screen time. “Everyone should have an online presence now,” he said, “and you have to constantly check it.”\n \n\n   \n  His struggle illustrates how the singular path to box-office fame has been replaced by a thousand algorithm-driven streams on social media apps like Instagram and TikTok.\n \n\n   \n  For Ibrahim Qadri, a Khan lookalike and social media influencer from Gujarat, it pays to trade on the existing fame of others, supplying a demand for connection that the real SRK could never sate.\n \n\n   \n  His Instagram feed is a meticulous recreation of Khan’s world: the signature arm-spread pose in a mustard field, a lip-sync to a classic song, a frame-by-frame remake of a famous movie scene. He is, in many ways, more accessible than the real Khan, making a living through brand deals with local businesses and paid appearances at weddings.\n \n\n   \n  “When I perform, I don’t think I’m imitating,” Qadri said. “I become him. I feel like I am him.”\n \n\n   \n  This profound devotion, which has garnered him more than 2 million followers, comes with a paradox: He might be the only person in India who doesn’t want to meet Khan.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve said that many times,” Qadri explains. “Because if I meet him, I feel my passion will end… what will be left to do in life?”\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t talk about Hindu-Muslim,” he once said in a 2020 interview in Hindi. “My wife is Hindu, I’m a Muslim, and our children are Hindustan (Indian).”\n \n\n   \n  But in today’s era of political polarization, defined by a new wave of Hindu nationalism, that same identity has been weaponized, transforming him from a unifying symbol into a cultural battleground.\n \n\n   \n  The 2023 release of his action film “Pathaan” (Warrior) served as a flashpoint. The brief appearance in a musical sequence of a female actor in a saffron bikini – a color associated with Hinduism – ignited a coordinated firestorm of outrage from far-right groups and politicians, who framed it as a deliberate insult to the religion.\n \n\n   \n  Calls for a nationwide boycott trended for weeks, and effigies of the actor were burned,  according  to local media reports. But the film’s eventual record-breaking success was a deafening rebuttal from his loyal fanbase.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if there will be another SRK or not,” said the author Bhattacharya. “What I do know is that we will need icons who unite us in conversation, not divide us into spiritual silos.”\n \n\n   \n  Back at the birthday congregation in Mumbai, a sea of fans surges outside Khan’s home. As the day wears on, the crowd swells to a formidable throng. Police struggle to maintain order, their wooden sticks cracking against the pavement in a futile attempt to control the sheer mass of people.\n \n\n   \n  Afternoon bleeds into evening, and as the sun sets over the Arabian Sea, the collective hope that they’ll see their hero   begins to fade. A message appears on X, confirming their disappointment. “Have been advised by authorities that I will not be able to step out and greet all you lovely people who have been waiting for me,” Khan writes, adding his “deepest apologies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Khatri, the aspiring actor, there will never be another like Khan.\n \n\n   \n  You have to almost be delusional to make it in the industry, he says. “It’s fun until the money runs out… It’s not going to happen in the next 10 days or months. But it will work out.”\n \n\n   \n  Inspired by Khan, a vision board in the corner of his room reads: “India’s next superstar.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/nancy-pelosi-retirement-candidates-replace","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"10:50:00-05:00","title":"Pelosi’s retirement announcement could open floodgates for a wave of new candidates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nancy Pelosi’s announcement of not seeking re-election in the 2026 congressional race has sparked a wave of new candidate entries, including Saikat Chakrabarti, Scott Wiener, Connie Chan, and London Breed.

November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision not to seek reelection next year could open the floodgates on the race to replace her.\n \n\n   \n  Pelosi, who has served in Congress since 1987, already had two primary challengers ahead of her Thursday announcement: Saikat Chakrabarti, a former chief of staff to US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic California state Sen. Scott Wiener.\n \n\n   \n  Chakrabarti launched his bid to unseat Pelosi earlier this year as part of a wave of younger Democratic challengers who argued the party needed candidates with new ideas to reshape it in the wake of Republicans’ 2024 electoral wins.\n \n\n   \n  Wiener, who has represented much of the city in the state Senate since 2016, previously said he wouldn’t challenge the former House Speaker. But he argued that it was necessary to get in against Chakrabarti, a self-funder who made his millions in the tech industry.\n \n\n   \n  “I never wanted to run against Nancy Pelosi. I have enormous respect for her – I think she walks on water,” Wiener said in an interview. “But there are limits to how long you can wait. At some point, you need to get into the race and start making the case to the voters.”\n \n\n   \n  Other candidates are expected to announce their own bids. San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan has been floated as a potential candidate and former San Francisco Mayor London Breed told Politico Friday she is considering running.\n \n\n   \n  Already, the field of prospective and declared candidates has sparked discussions about what kind of leader the district should elect to represent a rare, solidly blue open seat. Pelosi won re-election to the San Francisco seat in 2024 with 81% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re really seeking authentic and courageous leadership for working families across the country, and San Francisco deserves no less,” Jane Kim, the California director for the Working Families Party, told CNN. “It is a generational chance for a bold new voice in Congress for the city by the bay, and we look forward to a robust endorsement process.”\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how the field is shaping up so far:\n \n\n   \n    A tech millionaire and progressive activist\n \n\n   \n  Chakrabarti launched his campaign to unseat Pelosi in February, arguing that while he respected what she had accomplished during her career, the Democratic Party needed new leaders who could meet the current moment. He helped kick off a wave of young challengers who argued the party needs to be completely overhauled.\n \n\n   \n  He praised Pelosi for deciding not to seek reelection.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s a continuation of her leadership, to actually step down from power,” he said in an interview. “It’s a very rare act of leadership in Washington, DC.”\n \n\n   \n  A software engineer by trade, Chakrabarti made his fortune as a founding engineer at the payment platform Stripe. He went on to work on independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, helped found Justice Democrats, a progressive group that backs primary challenges against centrist Democratic incumbents, and managed Ocasio-Cortez’s 2018 congressional campaign. As her chief of staff, he helped author the Green New Deal, the left’s sweeping climate policy legislation.\n \n\n   \n  Chakrabarti has pointed to that resume as proof of his progressive bona fides after  facing criticism from some San Francisco progressives , particularly over his endorsement of a more centrist Board of Supervisors candidate who ousted a Democratic Socialists of America-backed incumbent last year. He said he’s been attacked from both the left and the right over the course of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “In San Francisco, I guess I’m in the center somewhere, and I hope that means the majority of the city is with me,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    A longtime state senator\n \n\n   \n  Wiener has focused on housing policy and LGBTQ rights during his nearly 10 years in the state Senate. He’s also set up a robust fundraising operation – his campaign announced that it had raised more than $730,000 on the day he launched his bid last month, before Pelosi announced her plans to retire.\n \n\n   \n  Wiener said the presence of a self-funder like Chakrabarti in the race, and a looming filing deadline, spurred him to jump in.\n \n\n   \n  Dan Newman, a San Francisco-based Democratic strategist, said that his decision to jump in early was “risky” but proved to be smart.\n \n\n   \n  “People understood that he couldn’t wait forever,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    A wide open field\n \n\n   \n  California’s congressional filing period doesn’t begin until early next year, at which point several Democrats and few Republicans could enter the race.\n \n\n   \n  Chan, who was first elected as a supervisor in 2020 and views Pelosi as a mentor, could garner support from progressives and labor leaders. Pelosi has not endorsed in the race, but political observers have noted the former Speaker and Chan worked together to pass Democrats’ redistricting push, Proposition 50.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is about thanking Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi for her legendary public service, and honoring her and her family for their extraordinary commitment to San Francisco and to bettering our entire country,” Chan said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The latest congressional hopeful to signal interest was Breed. The former mayor led the city from 2018 until 2025, after losing her re-election bid to incumbent Mayor Daniel Lurie.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important that San Franciscans have options,”  Breed told Politico . “I want to explore whether I could potentially be one of those options.”\n \n\n   \n  Another open question is whether Pelosi’s daughter, lawyer Christine Pelosi, will enter the race. Newman said that, for years, conventional wisdom held that the younger Pelosi would pursue the seat when her mother retired. That certainty has faded, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Whoever Pelosi eventually backs would become a frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  “If Nancy picked somebody off the street, then that gives them a little bit of instant credibility,” Newman said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-search-update","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00-05:00","title":"Wig disguises, a swapped license plate and a 1,000-mile drive: Where the search for 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard stands","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 9-year-old girl, Melodee Buzzard, went missing on October 9, 2025, after her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, drove her on a 1,000-mile road trip across six states, including to Nebraska.

Wig disguises, a swapped license plate and a 1,000-mile drive: Where the search for 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard stands \n       \n  By Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:30 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s been a month since Ashlee Buzzard packed her 9-year-old daughter Melodee into a rental car and left their home state of California – only to return three days later with no child and plenty of unanswered questions in tow, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  As investigators  search for Melodee , they say their probe has uncovered a series of wigged disguises, a sprawling multistate road trip, and an “uncooperative” mother who has provided “no verifiable explanation” of her daughter’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  The case took an unexpected turn on Friday when  Buzzard, 40, was arrested  on a charge of false imprisonment – but not for the disappearance of her daughter. “This crime is not connected to the ongoing search for Melodee, however, detectives are unable to fully outline the crime as it would impede their ongoing investigation,” the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the case – and the many questions that still remain.\n \n\n   \n    A concerned school official noticed Melodee’s ‘prolonged absence’\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on October 14, not by her family but by school administrators who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in.\n \n\n   \n  School district officials in the child’s hometown of Lompoc say Melodee was enrolled in August in an independent study program, which allows students to learn from home. That was  the last month  she was seen by the school, the sheriff’s office has said.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear whether the school last saw Melodee virtually or in person, but the sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  The school’s August sighting helped narrow detectives’ timeline at the beginning of the investigation, when authorities were working with outdated childhood photos and family members who said they had not seen Melodee for years.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years. The aunt said their extended family largely lost contact with the child after her father died in a motorcycle accident when she was a baby.\n \n\n   \n  When Melodee’s school asked for a welfare check on October 14, officers arrived at her mother’s home but only found Buzzard, who “provided  no verifiable explanation  for Melodee’s whereabouts,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found.\n \n\n   \n  The  sheriff’s office  said this week Buzzard “has remained uncooperative and has not confirmed Melodee’s location or welfare.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n    Melodee likely disappeared during a whirlwind multistate road trip\n \n\n   \n  Detectives have narrowed their investigation to a small but very eventful three-day window from October 7-10, in which they believe the mother drove Melodee more than 1,000 miles away – as far as Nebraska – crossing at least six states and trading license plates and disguises as they went.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the three-day trip, Buzzard returned home with the rental car, this time without Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  The last time Melodee was seen was on October 9 in an area around the Colorado and Utah state line. Here’s what  investigators say happened  on their trip:\n \n\n   \n  Finding Melodee now hinges on detectives unearthing what happened to the girl after she was last seen on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office released a  travel-route map  of where they believe the mother and daughter traveled between October 9 and 10, and is asking businesses, gas stations, hotels, rest stops and residents along the route to review surveillance camera footage that may catch a glimpse of the child.\n \n\n   \n    A series of wigs may have provided quick disguises, investigators say\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who came across the mother and daughter may not recognize them in some publicly released pictures, as authorities believe Buzzard may have taken steps to conceal their identities, including tucking her daughter’s ringlet curls under a smooth wig.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc on October 7 showed Buzzard and Melodee in what appeared to be wigs, the sheriff’s office said in a release that  shared a clip  of the video.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next three days, authorities say Buzzard appeared to swap wigs, trading fake, honey blonde curls for a darker wig closer to the style Melodee was seen in.\n \n\n   \n  “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel,” the release said.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s grandmother, Lilly Denes, told CNN affiliate  KSBY  that when she first saw the surveillance images, she was overwhelmed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was totally numb and in shock. … This is just so shocking to me in that my granddaughter is dressed in a disguise,” Denes told the affiliate.\n \n\n   \n  “If she’s listening, we love you. We’re here for you, and we just want you to be happy,” the grandmother said. “Call me. There are numbers on the TV that you can call, and I will come pick you up.”\n \n\n   \n    Mother is accused of falsely imprisoning someone in unrelated charge\n \n\n   \n  In a sudden turn of events on Friday, the sheriff’s office  announced  while they were investigating Melodee’s disappearance, they learned her mother had recently “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  “Although this arrest occurred during the course of the missing person investigation, it is not directly related to Melodee’s disappearance,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard  was arrested Friday  on a charge of false imprisonment, a felony charge, and investigators have been reluctant to provide details about the incident while they search for Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard will be booked at a Santa Barbara County jail with bail set at $100,000, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest comes about a week after the  FBI served search warrants  at Buzzard’s home and a storage locker, as well as the rental car Melodee was last seen in.\n \n\n   \n  But the sheriff’s office declined to provide the identity of the victim of the alleged false imprisonment.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheriff’s detectives remain fully focused on locating Melodee and confirming her safety,” the Friday release said.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who has seen Melodee or may have information about her whereabouts is encouraged to call the sheriff’s office or leave  an anonymous tip .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/health/enlicitide-cholesterol-lowering-drug-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Experimental daily pill may lower cholesterol in patients who don’t see enough benefit with statins alone, study finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Phase 3 clinical trial has shown that enlicitide, a new oral PCSK9 inhibitor, significantly reduces LDL cholesterol by up to 60% in patients who do not achieve target levels on statin therapy alone.

patients who don’t see enough benefit with statins alone, study finds \n       \n  By Jacqueline Howard, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:30 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For some people with high cholesterol, making lifestyle changes and taking routine statin medications may not be sufficient to help them reach their target cholesterol levels. For these patients, a new experimental pill could offer some hope.\n \n\n   \n  Phase 3 trial data found that people who took the investigational drug enlicitide with their routine cholesterol-lowering regimen, like statins, saw up to a 60% reduction in their LDL or “bad” cholesterol after 24 weeks of daily treatment, according to a  news release  about the results.  ﻿ That was in comparison with people who took a placebo along with their routine cholesterol-lowering medications. All study participants had high levels of LDL cholesterol and a history of either a major cardiovascular disease event, or they were at an increased risk for one.\n \n\n   \n  The new results, which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, were presented Saturday at the  American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions .\n \n\n   \n  Having high cholesterol in the blood can lead to a buildup called “plaque” on the walls of the arteries, raising the risk of cardiovascular disease. Heart disease is the  leading cause of death  in the United States. It’s estimated that  one person dies every 34 seconds  from cardiovascular disease in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Merck, the pharmaceutical company behind enlicitide, plans to apply for US Food and Drug Administration approval of enlicitide early next year, said Dr. Puja Banka, the company’s associate vice president of clinical research and global clinical development.\n \n\n   \n  “We wanted to show what enlicitide can deliver on top of statins, because we know that  70% of patients  that are treated with lipid-lowering therapies still don’t reach their guideline-directed goals,” Banka said about the new data. “So, the idea is really to show what we can achieve with enlicitide on top of statins.”\n \n\n   \n    When statins alone are not enough\n \n\n   \n  The new Phase 3 trial included 2,912 adults, with an average age of 63, who either had a previous heart attack or stroke or were at intermediate or high risk of a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years. Data were collected across 14 countries between August 2023 and July 2025.\n \n\n   \n  All of the adults in the study had elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite being on a stable course of lipid-lowering therapy like statins for 30 days or more. About 97% of them were taking statins and 26% were also taking another type of medication to help lower cholesterol levels – and they all continued these therapies during the study.\n \n\n   \n  But as an additional treatment, some of the adults were administered a once-daily pill of enlicitide and others were given a placebo.\n \n\n   \n  Enlicitide is a type of cholesterol-lowering drug known as a PCSK9 inhibitor, which works by helping to clear “bad” LDL cholesterol out of the bloodstream. On the other hand, statins lower LDL cholesterol by blocking an enzyme in the liver, which then forces the liver to remove more LDL cholesterol from the body.\n \n\n   \n  “Thus, it might be expected that adding enlicitide that works by a different mechanism to statins could further reduce LDL cholesterol,” Dr. Kristin Newby, a cardiologist and professor at Duke University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers found that after 24 weeks, the adults taking enlicitide not only saw up to a 60% reduction in LDL cholesterol, but reductions were sustained through 52 weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The adults taking enlicitide also showed a 53% reduction in a combination of all other cholesterol except for “good” HDL cholesterol; a 50% decrease in ApoB, a protein that helps carry fat and various “bad” types of cholesterol throughout the body; and a 28% drop in a type of fat in the body known as  lipoprotein(a) .\n \n\n   \n  As for the safety of the drug, about 10% of the adults taking enlicitide experienced serious adverse events during the study and a similar share, about 12%, of those taking a placebo experienced adverse events in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, the side effects were balanced between the enlicitide arm and the placebo arm,” Banka said. “There wasn’t a particular adverse event that stands out as imbalanced between the two.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of the adverse events reported in the trial were gastrointestinal disorders and certain infections, but the occurrence of these events was similar across both groups.\n \n\n   \n  “This provides some reasonable assurance of no major or high frequency adverse events or side effects,” said Newby, who is an expert with the American Heart Association.\n \n\n   \n  “However, similar to other new therapeutics, larger outcomes studies and post-marketing surveillance will be needed to identify any low frequency adverse effects that might occur,” Newby said. “The major benefit that is clear from this study is that enlicitide is very efficacious at lowering LDL cholesterol (by about 55%) compared with placebo on a background of statin therapy, and secondarily, it helps more people reach their LDL cholesterol treatment goal than with statins alone.”\n \n\n   \n    Expanding options for patients\n \n\n   \n  For people with high LDL cholesterol who may not respond sufficiently to commonly used treatments like statins alone, there is already the option to take injectable cholesterol-lowering  PCSK9 inhibitor s that are currently on the market.\n \n\n   \n  But a key difference between the PCSK9 inhibitors already on the market and the experimental enlicitide medication is that those currently on the market are administered as an injection.\n \n\n   \n  “Whereas enlicitide is an oral medication taken daily. Thus, offering an option in route and frequency of administration that may be preferable to some patients,” Newby said.\n \n\n   \n  Banka described enlicitide as the “first oral PCSK9 inhibitor to complete Phase 3 trials.”\n \n\n   \n  One new study has demonstrated that a PCSK9 inhibitor already on the market can  reduce major cardiovascular disease events  in adults with no prior heart attack or stroke.\n \n\n   \n  Adding the injectable PCSK9 inhibitor  evolocumab  — sold as Repatha —   to a cholesterol-lowering treatment regimen was found to reduce the risk of a first-time major cardiovascular event among adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or diabetes, according to a separate study presented Saturday at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was conducted across 33 countries between June 2019 and November 2021, and it included 12,257 adults, with an average age of 66. The adults were randomly separated into two groups. One group received evolocumab injections under the skin every two weeks while the other group received injections of a placebo every two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The data showed that, after an average of 4.6 years, adults in the evolocumab group saw a 25% reduced risk of coronary heart disease deaths, heart attack or ischemic stroke, compared with those in the placebo group.\n \n\n   \n  In the United States, evolocumab injection already has been  approved by the FDA . The  medication is indicated  to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in adults with established cardiovascular disease as well as to be used as an  “add-on” treatment for certain forms of high cholesterol .\n \n\n   \n  The latest trial results represent “the first demonstration of improved cardiovascular outcomes with a PCSK9 inhibitor, or any non-statin for that matter, in patients without a previous heart attack or stroke who are already being treated with a high-intensity lipid-lowering regimen,” lead study author Dr. Erin Bohula, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Brigham & Women’s Hospital and an investigator with the TIMI Study Group, said in a news release on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “Together with data from genetic studies of PCSK9 variants and other PCSK9 inhibitor outcomes studies, our findings suggest that long-term lowering with PCSK9 inhibitors can help to improve cardiovascular morbidity and potentially mortality over time,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/06/tech/openai-backtracks-government-support-chip-investments","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"09:32:00-05:00","title":"Why OpenAI Went Into Crisis PR Mode Thursday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"OpenAI faced a significant public relations crisis in early November 2025 when its CFO, Sarah Friar, made a controversial comment suggesting the U.S. government might need to provide a financial backstop for OpenAI’s $1.4 trillion investment in AI infrastructure.

went into crisis PR mode Thursday \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:32 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  OpenAI, the world’s leader in AI and ChatGPT parent company, went into panic mode on Thursday over what it said was a very public misstatement.\n \n\n   \n  Two top executives furiously backtracked from an earlier comment that suggested OpenAI might need government support to cover the $1.4 trillion in chips and data center infrastructure it’s committed to buying.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how the situation unfolded and why the since-retracted comment was so controversial.\n \n\n   \n    What OpenAI’s CFO said\n \n\n   \n  OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar raised eyebrows on Wednesday when she suggested that the US government should “backstop” the company’s aggressive investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  “The backstop, the guarantee, that allows the financing to happen, that can really drop the cost of the financing but also increase the loan-to-value, so the amount of debt that you can take on top of an equity portion,” she said  at a Wall Street Journal event .\n \n\n   \n  In other words: a federal government “backstop” for the debt AI companies take on to make chip investments.\n \n\n   \n  Friar quickly walked back the comments, clarifying in a  LinkedIn post  that the government needed to “play their part” in combination with the private sector to contribute to America’s AI growth. But OpenAI was “not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments.”\n \n\n   \n  But that may have confused matters even further and added to a chorus of questions that have been growing in recent weeks about how the not-yet-profitable startup plans to pay for its AI data center and chip commitments.\n \n\n   \n    Why was this so controversial?\n \n\n   \n  Friar’s initial comment took heat because it seemed to imply that the US government — and thus, taxpayers — should be on the hook if OpenAI can’t figure out how to pay for all the chips it has said it will buy. Like, how your parents who co-signed on your lease would be responsible if you didn’t pay your rent.\n \n\n   \n  And that didn’t sit well with many people, given that OpenAI is a private company valued at $500 billion, from which taxpayers wouldn’t be seeing any direct benefit if it succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  “Will there be a political movement to forgive AI chip loans like student loans? Can OpenAI wind up in conservatorship like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?” Jones Trading chief market strategist Mike O’Rourke wrote in emailed commentary Wednesday. “It is absurd that OpenAI insiders think the U.S. government should furnish them with preferential borrowing rates while they get to grow the value of their privately held shares on the backs of American taxpayers.”\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, the comments seemed to suggest — as many investors and Silicon Valley watchers have  worried in recent months  — that OpenAI isn’t quite sure how it will pay for its $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments without some creative maneuvering. That would be an issue for everyone, since it has been on a  dealmaking spree  with Nvidia, AMD, Amazon and others, helping to prop up the stock market.\n \n\n   \n    OpenAI CEO Sam Altman weighs in\n \n\n   \n  By Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stepped in to try to further clarify the company’s position on a government backstop. He revealed that the company expects to earn $20 billion in revenue this year and plans to grow to “hundreds of billions” in annual revenue by 2030 with investments in things like enterprise AI and consumer devices.\n \n\n   \n  Altman reiterated that the company “does not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.”\n \n\n   \n  “We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market,” Altman said in an X  post .\n \n\n   \n  The government could consider, however, investing in its own data centers and guarantee loans for building new US chip fabrication plants, he said. The White House has pushed tech giants to do just that to protect national security.\n \n\n   \n  “If we screw up and can’t fix it, we should fail, and other companies will continue on doing good work and servicing customers,” Altman said. “That’s how capitalism works and the ecosystem and economy would be fine.”\n \n\n   \n    How does Trump factor into all this?\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has said that building new AI infrastructure and ensuring that America wins the global AI race are national priorities. His administration has  committed to  pulling back on AI regulations and streamlining permitting for new data centers and energy infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s AI Czar David Sacks said on X Thursday that “there will be no federal bailout for AI,” adding that if one AI company fails, “others will take its place.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/anti-trump-vote-virigina-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-05:00","title":"The anti-Trump vote appears as strong as ever","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 off-year elections in Virginia and New Jersey reveal a significant and growing anti-Trump sentiment, with 41% of voters indicating opposition to Donald Trump and only 21% expressing support—twice as many anti-Trump votes as pro-Trump ones.

I didn’t do a lot of support for the other candidate [in New Jersey]. They asked me about [New York City mayoral candidate Andrew] Cuomo, and I said, well, it’s a question – do you want a thug or do you want a communist?\n \n\n   \n  “So I wasn’t involved in that stuff too much.”\n \n\n   \n  But however you want to characterize Trump’s role in Tuesday’s  off-year elections  in Virginia and New Jersey, there is no question they were about him.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the results appear to have been more of a direct rebuke to Trump than any previous election that didn’t actually feature him on the ballot.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps one of the biggest lessons of this week is that the anti-Trump vote appears stronger than ever. And, as notably, the pro-Trump vote appears as weak as ever.\n \n\n   \n  Even before the election, this was perhaps my biggest takeaway from the  CNN poll  released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  It showed 41% of registered voters said that if they were voting for Congress today, their vote would be meant to show opposition to Trump. Meanwhile, just 21% said their vote would be meant to show support for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  So about twice as many anti-Trump votes as pro-Trump ones.\n \n\n   \n  That’s not normal. While unpopular presidents are not exactly uncommon these days, that was actually the biggest such gap in CNN polling in nearly 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  The last time twice as many voters viewed their vote in a non-presidential election as opposing rather than supporting the president was in 2006. At the time, 36% of registered voters viewed their vote as against George W. Bush, while just 15% viewed it as pro-Bush. (Republicans got shellacked in that election.)\n \n\n   \n  The numbers weren’t quite as pronounced ahead of Trump’s first midterm election, in 2018, when 38% of voters described their votes as anti-Trump, versus 25% who were pro-Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Okay, that’s national polling. So, did this show up on Tuesday in the election? It sure did.\n \n\n   \n  While we didn’t have a nationwide election, the exit-poll data we do have from the key states suggests the anti-Trump vote was stronger than before.\n \n\n   \n  The gap between anti-Trump votes and pro-Trump votes in Virginia went from 17 points in 2017 (34%-17%) to 22 points on Tuesday (38%-16%).\n \n\n   \n  It grew even more in New Jersey, going from 17 points in 2017 (28%-11%) to 28 points this time (41%-13%).\n \n\n   \n  And 2017 was the worst-polling year of Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  The gaps between anti- and pro-Trump votes in these states were also significantly larger than they were nationally in either the 2018 or 2022 midterms, when both measured at 12 points. (Trump was out of office in 2022, of course, but he still loomed large in American politics.)\n \n\n   \n  That’s not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, given Virginia and New Jersey lean modestly to the left. (Trump lost both states in 2024 by 6 points.) But it’s not like these are deep-blue states, either.\n \n\n   \n  And New Jersey is a state Trump and his allies have tried to pitch as a swing state in the making. Yet there were three times as many anti-Trump voters there Tuesday as pro-Trump ones.\n \n\n   \n  All of which suggests a couple things.\n \n\n   \n  The first is that the massive size of the  “No Kings” rallies  was no fluke. The anti-Trump movement appears as strong, motivated and robust as ever. Its adherents might not be keen on the Democratic Party these days, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t engaged and even prepared to vote.\n \n\n   \n  The second point hasn’t gotten as much attention. And that’s that, for all of Trump’s huge power grabs and his political domination of the Republican Party, his base actually doesn’t seem terribly enthused right now.\n \n\n   \n  Just 1 in 5 registered voters said in the CNN poll ahead of the election that their vote would be intended to support Trump. It was even less than that in New Jersey and Virginia on Election Day, according to CNN’s exit polls\n \n\n   \n  These are not the numbers of an all-powerful, domineering force whose actions are beloved by half the country and who can marshal voters to the polls when he decides to get more involved.\n \n\n   \n  And it suggests there’s something to the data we’re seeing where Trump’s base isn’t exactly gung-ho about some of his policies. I wrote about this back in July – the idea that there was  something of a “malaise” setting in on the right . It looks like that’s a real electoral problem for Trump and the GOP now.\n \n\n   \n  Whatever the case, these numbers are worth paying close attention to moving forward.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/health/cholesterol-gene-edit-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"09:56:00-05:00","title":"Scientists Have Edited a Gene That May Reduce High Cholesterol Permanently","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A pilot study using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to disable the ANGPTL3 gene in patients with severe high cholesterol shows a nearly 50% reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 55% reduction in triglycerides.

9:56 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With a snip of a gene, doctors may one day permanently lower dangerously  high cholesterol,  possibly removing the need for medication, according to a new pilot study published Saturday in the  New England Journal of Medicine .\n \n\n   \n  The study was extremely small — only 15 patients with severe disease — and was meant to test the safety of a new medication delivered by CRISPR-Cas9, a biological sort of scissor which cuts a targeted gene to modify or turn it on or off.\n \n\n   \n  Preliminary results, however, showed nearly a 50% reduction in  low-density lipoprotein , or LDL, the “bad” cholesterol which plays a major role in heart disease — the No.1 killer of adults in the  United States  and  worldwide .\n \n\n   \n  The study, which will be presented Saturday at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in New Orleans, also found an average 55% reduction in  triglycerides , a different type of fat in the blood that is also linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope this is a permanent solution, where younger people with severe disease can undergo a ‘one and done’ gene therapy and have reduced LDL and triglycerides for the rest of their lives,” said senior study author Dr. Steven Nissen, chief academic officer of the Sydell and Arnold Miller Family Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s a dream come true,” Nissen said. “If you’d asked me 15 years ago if we could have done something like this, I would have thought you were crazy,”\n \n\n   \n  Today, cardiologists want people with existing heart disease or those born with a predisposition for hard-to-control cholesterol to lower their LDL well below 100, which is the average in the US, said Dr. Pradeep Natarajan, director of preventive cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n \n\n   \n  “There is evidence to suggest that the optimal cholesterol level is 40 to 50, which is very hard to do through diet and lifestyle,” said Natarajan, who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, today’s medications can already lower LDL cholesterol to the levels found in the study — in fact, some medicines are a little more potent,” he said. “So we’re going to have to wait and see if this treatment works as well as this first study suggests.”\n \n\n   \n  While early, the findings are exciting due to the difficulty of remembering to take a daily medication — and sometimes three or four — to control high cholesterol levels, said preventive cardiologist Dr. Ann Marie Navar, an associate professor of cardiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “In spite of having a lot of available therapies, the majority of people do not have their LDL under control,” said Navar, who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re 20 and you have really high cholesterol, it may make a lot more sense to have a one-time treatment that doesn’t require you to have to take a pill every single day or shot every two weeks for the next 60 years,” she said. “The potential for this is just enormous.”\n \n\n   \n    A lucky mutation to reduce high cholesterol\n \n\n   \n  The idea for a gene-editing treatment came from an unusual source — a genetic mutation. In that scenario, the ANGPTL3, or angiopoietin-like protein 3 gene, which is responsible for regulating LDL and triglycerides is shut off.\n \n\n   \n  People with a nonfunctioning ANGPTL3 gene  — which Natarajan says applies to about 1 in 250 people in the US — have lifelong levels of low LDL cholesterol and triglycerides without any apparent negative consequences. They also have exceedingly low or no risk for cardiovascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a naturally occurring mutation that’s protective against cardiovascular disease,”  said Nissen, who holds the Lewis and Patricia Dickey Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine at Cleveland Clinic. “And now that CRISPR is here, we have the ability to change other people’s genes so they too can have this protection.”\n \n\n   \n  Various doses of the CRISPR-based drug were given to study participants by infusion: One set of people received a very tiny dose of 0.1 milligrams per kilogram, while others received levels from 0.3 to 0.8 milligrams per kilogram, said lead study author Dr. Luke Laffin, a preventive cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic’s Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “The average 55% decrease in triglycerides and nearly 50% in LDL cholesterol occurred at the highest dose,” Laffin said. “That’s exciting because there are no therapies available now that simultaneously lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.”\n \n\n   \n  There was a small decrease in HDL (high density lipoprotein), which is known as “good” cholesterol. However the drop in HDL is also found in people with the ANGPTL3 mutation and doesn’t appear to be harmful, Laffin said.\n \n\n   \n  “The most common disorder that we see in our prevention clinic is mixed hyperlipidemia —people who have trouble controlling both their LDL and triglycerides,” Nissen said. “So to be able to do this simultaneously is really an important development.”\n \n\n   \n    Long-term safety profile\n \n\n   \n  In people with the natural mutation, the ANGPTL3 gene is turned off in every cell in the body — muscles, heart, lungs and so forth. The new medication, however, targets only the liver, the organ responsible for synthesizing triglycerides and producing cholesterol while also removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n \n\n   \n  That’s reassuring for the long-term safety of the drug’s impact, Nissen said, making it less likely that genes in other parts of the body could also be edited.\n \n\n   \n  Side effects of the initial treatment were minimal, mostly irritation at infusion sites, according to the study. One person suffered a spinal disk herniation, and another had an increase in enzymes that could signal liver damage, but those levels resolved within two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  However, one person died six months after the infusion: “He had extensive, advanced cardiovascular disease, and he got the tiniest 0.1 dose, a dose that doesn’t do anything,” Nissen said.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t think that his death has any implications to the study at all,” he said. “In addition, the FDA has recommended these people be followed after the trials are all over for 15 years to see if there are long term adverse effects.

Christian Edwards, Alejandra Jaramillo, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:42 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Donald Trump has granted Hungary a one-year exemption from US sanctions for buying Russian oil and gas, a White House official told CNN Friday, after Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán met the US President in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  For months, Trump has berated European Union countries for continuing to buy oil and gas from Russia, saying this helps fuel the Kremlin’s war machine and prolong the  war in Ukraine  that he has been at pains to end.\n \n\n   \n  But when Orbán – whose country buys more Russian oil and gas than any other EU nation – showed up at the White House on Friday, Trump was full of praise for the “great leader” of a “great country,” claiming it has been “difficult” for Hungary to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, since it is landlocked.\n \n\n   \n  For Orbán, a darling of the MAGA movement, the carve-out has spared Hungary from the violent economic shock it was facing after the Trump administration last month put sanctions on two Russian oil giants. Before those sanctions were announced, Orbán had told Trump, his longtime ally, that cutting Russian energy supplies would bring Hungary’s economy “to its knees.”\n \n\n   \n  The exemption for Hungary will raise questions about the Trump administration’s seriousness in enforcing its sanctions on Russia’s oil exports. Analysts warn that Trump’s cutting his allies some slack will embolden others to try to circumvent US sanctions, eroding their ability to inflict economic pain on Russia and hasten the end of its war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “The US decision is a terrible and unnecessary mistake that will allow over 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to flow into the Kremlin’s war chest,” Isaac Levi, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), told CNN. “By carving out special treatment for Hungary, Washington is telling other buyers that they can keep handling Russian oil and still expect to be let off the hook.”\n \n\n   \n  Levi also questioned the Trump administration’s rationale for the exemption, pointing to how the Czech Republic, another landlocked country, manages without Russian crude oil and has lower fuel prices at the pump than Hungary. “This clearly shows that the oil flows that continue to finance Putin’s war in Ukraine are entirely unnecessary,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Orbán is also hoping that Trump might re-open the door to a summit with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, which the US president announced last month, but which was soon shelved. Trump said Friday that his team was talking with Orbán about meeting with Putin.\n \n\n   \n  In a press conference before the lunch with Orbán, Trump expressed sympathy for Hungary’s energy insecurity since “they don’t have ports, and so they have a difficult problem,” he said. The president added that he was “disturbed” that other European countries that “don’t have those problems” were continuing to buy “a lot of oil and gas from Russia.”\n \n\n   \n  But Hungary and neighboring Slovakia are the only EU countries still receiving oil from Russia, via the Druzhba pipeline. In the wake of Moscow’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, EU countries moved to phase out Russian oil, but granted an exemption to Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – three countries heavily reliant on Russian imports – to give them time to reduce their reliance.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, Hungary and Slovakia used the exemption to deepen their dependence. Hungary upped its dependence on Russian crude oil from 61% pre-invasion to 86% in 2024. This year, Russia accounted for 92% of Hungary’s crude oil imports. Slovakia, meanwhile, is “almost 100% dependent” on Russian crude oil, according to a  report  from CREA, and the Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD).\n \n\n   \n  The report said phasing out Russian oil is “fully feasible” for Hungary and Slovakia, as the Adria pipeline in Croatia “can meet their combined needs.” Orbán, however, denied this, claiming that the Croatian government would need to enlarge the pipeline to meet Hungary’s needs.\n \n\n   \n  Although EU countries have continued to buy Russian gas, funneled via Turkey through the TurkStream pipeline, Russia’s share of EU gas imports fell from 40% pre-invasion to 11% in 2024. Last month, EU countries agreed to ban all imports of Russian gas from 2028. Hungary and Slovakia opposed the ban.\n \n\n   \n  In an analysis published before Trump’s meeting with Orbán, the Atlantic Council said the White House should be “clear-eyed about the fact that, despite Trump’s chumminess with Orbán, he has been the roadblock to the action the United States is demanding from Europe.”\n \n\n   \n  But, using talking points that have helped win him Trump’s affection in the past, Orbán claimed Hungary, as a “Christian” country that has taken a hard stance against immigration, is a “special island of difference in a liberal ocean in Europe.”\n \n\n   \n  Orbán praised Trump for repairing what he described as damage caused to the US-Hungary relations by the Biden administration, which imposed sanctions on Hungary largely to punish Orbán for democratic backsliding. The Trump administration has since removed some of those sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  “Now we are (in) quite a good position to open up a new chapter – let’s say a golden age – between the United States and Hungary,” Orbán said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604157","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:08:00Z","title":"Flesh wins 2025 Booker Prize: 'We had never read anything quite like it'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Szalay’s novel 'Flesh' has won the 2025 Booker Prize, praised for its innovative use of white space and its portrayal of a quiet, introspective character, István, whose life spans Hungary and England.

Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —President Trump has announced that no U.S. officials will attend the G20 Summit hosted by South Africa – the current rotating chair of the group of major world economies – in Johannesburg later this month, citing \"human rights\" concerns. Vice President JD Vance had been due to attend in Trump's place. \"It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa. Afrikaners (People who are descended from Dutch settlers, and also French and German immigrants) are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,\" Trump posted on Truth Social over the weekend. He previously said South Africa should be kicked out of \"the gs\" altogether. Trump has been relentlessly critical of South Africa since his return to office. He  ambushed  the country's president Cyril Ramaphosa during a White House visit in May falsely accusing his government of seizing white-owned land;  cut aid  to South Africa;  his administration  expelled  the South African ambassador to Washington; slapped the country with  30 percent tariffs;  repeated debunked far-right claims about a white genocide -  and as a result prioritized Afrikaners for  fast-track refugee status  in the U.S. (while stopping refugee admissions from most other countries). The South African government has repeatedly tried to correct the White House, providing statistics that disprove these claims – for example the fact that Black people are by far the worst affected by violent crime and that whites still own the majority of commercial farmland – to no avail. Now, some white Afrikaners themselves, as well as Afrikaans groups, are calling out what they say are the U.S. administration's \"lies\" and \"falsehoods\" in their name. \"We reject the narrative that casts Afrikaners as victims of racial persecution in post-apartheid South Africa,\" a group of over 40 prominent Afrikaners said in an  open letter last month . \"We are not pawns in America's culture wars.\" The group included writers, journalists, musicians, university lecturers and Christian clergy. \"Afrikaners have done harm in the past, and we acknowledge that,\" the letter said, referring to the fact that their ancestors – as well as British settlers – colonized the country. The Afrikaners later set up the apartheid system which segregated the races, prevented the Black majority from voting, and brutally clamped down on dissent. \"As citizens of post-apartheid South Africa, we have dedicated ourselves to building our country. Singling us out as victims of multiracialism alienates us from our fellow-South Africans and harms relationships that have been fostered over the past 30 years.\" 'Please stop lying'  Max du Preez, an Afrikaner journalist and author who was among the signatories of the letter, told NPR they rejected the narrative coming out of the White House as \"the abuse of our ethnic identity to further the MAGA movement's interests.\" \"There is no genocide in South Africa, there's absolutely no persecution of anyone based on race. Our constitution has iron-clad protection of every citizen's human rights,\" he said. \"Not a single square inch of white-owned land has been confiscated since we became a democracy in 1994,\" du Preez added. \"Please stop lying about us and using us as pawns.\" Trump has repeatedly said he particularly wants to help white Afrikaans farmers. But some agricultural organizations that represent them have stressed their businesses will be hurt too if the US sanctions South Africa. Christo van der Rheede represented white farmers for years as head of the biggest agricultural organization in South Africa. He now leads the FW De Klerk Foundation, named for the former Afrikaans president who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela for their roles in ending apartheid. \"It is now very important for all South Africans to unite and refute the statements by President Donald Trump…that Afrikaners are being killed and slaughtered and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated. This is simply not true,\" van der Rheede said after Trump's G20 announcement. He said the U.S. should reconsider boycotting the G20. \"The role of the G20 as a key driver of uniting and building a better and just world is critical and it will be very negative for the US and its business interests in South Africa should it continue to premise its reasons for staying away on falsehoods,\" he added. Despite the pushback from some segments of Afrikaans society, there are others who are fierce supporters of Trump and have welcomed his position on South Africa. For years some Afrikaner groups have been travelling to the US pushing the \"white genocide\" narrative and lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill. For its part, the South African government released a measured statement noting Trump's announcement. \"We really think this is going to be one of the most significant G20's to date albeit without the U.S.A. I think that is something that will affect the U.S. as a country, not the entire G20,\"   Chrispin Phiri, spokesman for the Department of International Relations, later told NPR. The summit  will be attended by European heads of state and China's President Xi Jinping is expected. Its theme – which the US State Department has objected to – is \"solidarity, equality and sustainability.\" \"South Africa is doing very bad things,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X in February. \"Using G20 to promote \"solidarity, equality, & sustainability.\" In other words: DEI and climate change.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604664","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00-05:00","title":"Trump slams air traffic controllers who called out during the government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, air traffic controllers were forced to work without pay for over 40 days, leading to widespread operational challenges, including a 10% flight reduction at major airports and over 4,500 flight cancellations.

Trump said in a  post on Truth Social  Monday morning that he was \"NOT HAPPY\" with controllers who took time off. \"All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!! Anyone who doesn't will be substantially 'docked,'\" he wrote. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Federal Aviation Administration had been contending with a shortage of air traffic controllers since well before the shutdown began, but the crisis deepened when the government closed and controllers received a partial paycheck and then no pay at all.. Some have taken on second jobs, while others have called in sick. Controllers are set to miss their second full paycheck this week. In a statement to NPR, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said, \"This nation's air traffic controllers have been working without pay for over 40 days. The vast majority of these highly trained and skilled professionals continue to perform one of the most stressful and demanding jobs in the world, despite not being compensated. Many are working six-day weeks and ten-hour days without any pay.\" \"These unsung heroes, who report for duty to safely guide this country's passengers and cargo to their destinations, deserve our praise. They have certainly earned it.\" Meanwhile, Trump called controllers who took no time off during the longest shutdown in U.S. history \"GREAT PATRIOTS\" and said he would recommend giving them each a $10,000 bonus. He said any controllers who wanted to quit shouldn't hesitate, but would receive \"NO payment or severance of any kind!\" and would be \"quickly replaced by true Patriots.\" (In fact, one reason for the shortage is that  it takes years to train and certify  new controllers.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a subsequent  post on X , Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy praised \"those who have worked throughout the shutdown\" and said he would work with Congress to \"reward your commitment.\" Others offered sharp criticism of Trump's comments. \"The President wouldn't last five minutes as an air traffic controller,\" former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg  said in a post on X , \"and after everything they've been through - and the way this administration has treated them from Day One - he has no business s****ing on them now.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Last week, the  FAA announced  it would reduce flights by up to 10% at 40 of the busiest airports in the country, starting with a 4% reduction put in place on Friday.

At Philadelphia International Airport, Phill Hicks' flight to West Palm Beach, Fla., was canceled and rebooked twice on Sunday.

The challenge to the court's 2015 ruling came from Kim Davis, the former Kentucky clerk who refused to issue same-sex licenses after the court's Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. In the aftermath of her refusal, Davis was jailed for acting in contempt of court and lost her clerk re-election. A jury also ordered her to pay $360,000 to a couple who she refused to marry. Davis attempted to get out of paying this verdict by additionally requesting that the court assert that she has a First Amendment religious protection from liability for her actions. The court declined her petition without comment. Davis has long argued that religious liberties conflict with Obergefell.  \"If ever there was a case of exceptional importance, the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it,\" she argued in her  petition  before the court. She is not alone in wanting to challenge the legality of same-sex marriage. According to  Lambda Legal , which advocates for gay rights, in this year alone at least nine states have entertained bills or resolutions criticizing Obergefell or have sought to limit marriage to heterosexual couples. On Oct. 24, the Supreme Court of Texas  adopted language  allowing judges to refuse to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies due to religious beliefs.  In his concurring opinion in the case that overturned the constitutional right to abortion, Justice Clarence Thomas  expressly stated  that the Supreme Court should reconsider its stances on birth control, same-sex marriage, and same-sex intimacy. Had the Supreme Court decided to hear Davis' case and later overturn Obergefell, same-sex marriage would still be protected on the federal level. In 2022, former President Joe Biden signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act, which repeals the Defense of Marriage Act and recognizes the legitimacy of same-sex and interracial marriages. If Obergefell was overturned, however, individual states could refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. The court's decision to not hear Davis's petition means that the constitutionality of same-sex marriage is reaffirmed, at least for now. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts, showcasing musical performances on a popular NPR platform.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","NPR","Music","Featured Performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604283","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"19:18:00-05:00","title":"FDA Commissioner on lifting warnings on hormone therapy for menopause","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is removing black box warnings from hormone therapy products—such as pills, patches, and creams—used to treat menopause and perimenopause symptoms.

This is based on a robust review of the latest scientific evidence.\" It was time for a change, Makary told NPR's  All Things Considered , because women have \"been denied or never offered hormone replacement therapy despite the profound short term and long term benefits.\" ( Watch the interview above. ) Instead of black box warnings on labels, he said, the agency wants to see a nuanced explanation of potential risks appear in a packaging insert: \"The idea is to get better information in front of women.\" The label change will make estrogen products more accessible to perimenopausal women and improve their lives, said  Dr. Steven Fleischman ,   president of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, or ACOG,  in a statement .  \"The updated labels will better allow patients and clinicians to engage in a shared decision-making process, without an unnecessary barrier, when it comes to treatment of menopausal symptoms.\" Though he added that the medical organization's official guidance on estrogen therapy hasn't changed because it has \"long advised\" its members to talk to patients about their unique risks. The FDA convened an expert panel in July to discuss removing them from at least low-dose vaginal estrogen. The agency then  opened a docket  to solicit comments from the public and received nearly 3,000 by the Sept. 24 deadline. In its formal comment, ACOG wrote that it has \"long encouraged\" the agency to reevaluate warning labels on low-dose estrogen products administered vaginally, but it considers those separate from systemic estrogen products that deliver the hormone throughout the body, such as pills and patches. ACOG's Fleischman said in Monday's statement that, \"like all medications, systemic estrogen products are not without risk, and their use should be based on an individualized conversation between patients and their clinicians.\" Doctors had gone back and forth about the risks versus benefits of hormone therapy for years. In 2002, researchers rang the alarm about them because a long-term study called  the Women's Health Initiative  found that hormone therapy was associated with increased risk of cancer and stroke. Since then, additional research has shown those risks were overstated, and the therapy can instead reduce heart disease when prescribed earlier. \"Fifty million women since that study 23 years ago have been denied or never offered or talked out of the life changing lifesaving benefits of hormone replacement therapy – including my mom,\" Makary said during the press conference Monday about the label changes. Makary added doctors are often taught in medical school that menopause is mild and lasts a few years, but that's wrong. \"The symptoms occur in over 80% of women. They last, on average, eight years. And for many women, they are severe, even debilitating: mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, hot flashes, divorce.\" Although doctors have pushed to have the black box warnings removed, they say the special panel the FDA convened in July deviated from the usual process for making such changes and lacked the rigor of the usual approach. \"While we appreciate the FDA Expert Panel's interest in reevaluating the label warnings on hormone therapy, a brief panel such as the two-hour July 17th Expert Panel should not be considered an adequate substitute for an advisory committee meeting,\" ACOG wrote in its formal comment to the agency. FDA advisory committees are made up of independent experts who evaluate scientific presentations, discuss and debate the evidence on a given topic and then vote on recommendations for the FDA. The agency doesn't always follow its committees' recommendations, but it usually does. \"Forgoing the advisory committee process runs counter to the Agency's stated goal to increase transparency.\" ACOG writes. \"Therefore, ACOG urges the FDA to delve deeper into the benefits of low-dose vaginal estrogen for [genitourinary syndrome of menopause] and systemic estrogen therapy for vasomotor symptoms by convening separate advisory committee meetings, including opportunities for public engagement, before making decisions on possible labeling changes for these distinct menopausal hormone therapy options.\" Makary said during the press conference that the agency chose not to have an advisory committee meeting, \"because [advisory committees] are bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive.\" He said his FDA is doing more expert panels instead, which are less strict and can be more spontaneous but remain robust. In an email to NPR, the agency shared several studies in support of its decision. The studies showed that these hormone therapies reduced the risk of  Alzheimer's disease ,  heart attack  and  hip fracture . The findings aren't new, however, and were published between 1980 and 1996. The agency also cited an  analysis of 30 studies  from 1966 through 2003 that showed starting hormone replacement therapy earlier could save lives. It was published in 2004. During the press conference, Makary held up a study he said was published in the medical journal  Cancer  from three years ago that showed a decrease in coronary heart disease among women using hormone replacement therapy. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5603659","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:57:00-05:00","title":"Senators take first step toward reopening the government after historic shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, a bipartisan Senate group voted 60–40 on November 9, 2025, to reopen the government with funding through January 30, 2025, and full-year support for SNAP through September 30, 2026.

Senators take first step toward reopening the government after historic shutdown \n         By Claudia Grisales, Luke Garrett \n        \n           Sunday, November 9, 2025 • 10:57 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A bipartisan group of Senate Democrats and Republicans reached a deal to  reopen the government  after the longest shutdown in U.S. history, voting on the first procedural step on the measure. The agreement would fund the government through Jan. 30 and include full-year funding for a trio of appropriations bills, including full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or  SNAP , through Sept. 30, 2026, or the end of the fiscal year. The vote late on Sunday was 60 to 40, with seven Democrats and one independent joining with most Republicans to advance the measure. It marked the first, but crucial, step towards passing the measure in the Senate. Once the bill cleared the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster, any remaining Senate votes need just a simple majority. However, the legislation still needs to pass the House before the shutdown would end, enabling  air traffic controllers  and other federal workers to get paid and federal food benefits to resume, among other things. Senate Democrats had earlier voted against more than a dozen short-term spending measures in their fight to preserve health care subsidies. But as the pain of the shutdown continued to bite, some agreed to more modest changes in the latest framework. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The continuing resolution to fund the government until the end of January would also include language to reverse any reductions in force of federal employees that happened during the shutdown, as well as protections against further such layoffs through the end of the fiscal year, and backpay for all federal employees during the shutdown. \"I have long said that to earn my vote, we need to be on a path toward fixing Republicans' health care mess and to protect the federal workforce,\" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said in a statement. \"This deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which Republicans weren't willing to do.\" The agreement to reopen the government is also expected to include a Senate vote on health care by the second week of December, on a bill of Democrats' choosing. That informal deal is not part of the legislative text. Democrats are deeply divided about the compromise measure, which was opposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \"I think it's a terrible mistake,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said of the deal. \"The American people want us to stand and fight for healthcare.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Democratic divisions over legislation Several top Democrats in the House also vowed to vote against the bill. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., panned the agreement in a statement before the Senate vote. \"We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries said in a statement. \"We will fight the GOP bill in the House of Representatives, where Mike Johnson will be compelled to end the seven week Republican taxpayer-funded vacation.\" And Democrat Rep. Greg Casar of Texas called the deal a \"betrayal\" and a \"capitulation\" because it doesn't reduce health care costs. The House has not held a vote since Sept. 19, and previously passed a government funding measure without Democratic support. The Senate deal on government funding comes after Democrats cruised to a series of  electoral victories in the last week , giving some in the party newfound political confidence to continue to fight for health care extensions. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many Democrats believed that keeping the government shut down gave them their only legislative leverage, with Republicans still in control of Congress and the White House. Moderate Democrats defended their votes, with some telling reporters that it's the best deal they could do. Kaine, one of the Democrats who voted for the measure on Sunday, defended his support, saying Democrats would be able to put important health care legislation up for a vote. \"Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don't, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,\" he said in his statement. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5603417","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:12:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration again asks Supreme Court intervene on order for full SNAP benefits","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to block a lower court order requiring full funding of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for November, despite prior commitments to send full benefits.

    \n           Updated Monday, November 10, 2025 • 12:12 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration has notified the U.S. Supreme Court that it still wants to fight a lower court ruling requiring full SNAP benefits be paid for November. The move comes after an appeals court late Sunday refused another government attempt to deny full funding for the nation's largest anti-hunger program. The administration's appeal to the high court over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program comes despite new efforts to end the federal shutdown, which would render the issue moot. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At issue is an order from a federal judge in Rhode Island, to increase SNAP payments from the 65% the government says it can afford to 100% of what SNAP recipients are entitled to. In its ruling, the appeals court said the harm from denying millions of people food aid \"would be immense,\" and it repeated the lower court finding that the funding gap could have been avoided. \"The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,\" the appeals court said. The federal judge in Rhode Island, John J. McConnell Jr., had accused the government of delaying payment for \"political purposes.\" The chaos of moves and counter-moves has left states scrambling and heads spinning, and many SNAP enrollees remain uncertain how much of their benefit to expect for November, and when it will come. On Friday, after the administration said it would send full payments (even as it appealed the order to do so), a number of states immediately started sending out that money. Around the country, some participants started getting it on the debit-like cards they use to buy groceries. Then the  Supreme Court late Friday  granted a request to temporarily pause those full payments while the appeals court considered the issue more fully. Adding to the confusion, Trump administration officials on Saturday directed states to \"immediately undo\" any actions they have made to fully fund SNAP, and only pay 65%. In a statement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said  such payments were \"unauthorized ,\" and threatened states that they may end up having to cover those costs themselves, and facing financial penalties.    Rhode Island is one of several states that had already sent full benefits to SNAP recipients before the Supreme Court temporarily halted full payments. In a statement Sunday, Democratic Gov. Dan McKee railed against President Trump, saying he \"intentionally created chaos for states across the country — playing games with people's ability to feed their families, weaponizing hunger, and gaslighting the American people. It's inhumane.\" McKee said he was working on contingency options \"to protect Rhode Islanders against President Trump's volatility.\" At the same time, Rhode Island is among some two dozen states, who sought and obtained temporary protection from federal judge in Massachusetts. A hearing on that issue is set for Monday afternoon. In court papers, the states said they feared that the federal government \"may attempt to recoup funds from the States that the States' residents have used to feed themselves and their families.\" That could amount to hundreds of million dollars, they said, and would \"risk catastrophic operational disruptions for the States, with a consequent cascade of harms for their residents.\" Trump administration officials did not respond to requests for comment. But over the weekend, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins  took to X to blame Democrats  for the lapse in benefits, and railed against \"activist judges\" who have ordered \"reckless and unconstitutional legal maneuvers\" to force funding that Congress didn't appropriate. Speaking to Fox News, Rollins borrowed language from anti-Trump activists. \"It's interesting, the 'No Kings' rally, where they said 'we don't want a King in America,'\" Rollins said. \"Except now they want a king who can create money out of the clear blue sky.\" Meanwhile, SNAP recipients remain in limbo, as do the organizations that serve them. The Facing Hunger Foodbank in Huntington, W.V., has tripled the volume of food distributions that are usual this time of year, according to CEO Cynthia Kirkhart. People are struggling, she says, and all the uncertainty has just exacerbated their pain. \"The news comes out that we are going to get SNAP benefits. Then, we aren't going to get SNAP benefits. This is much worse. Folks get their hopes built up and then they crash. It's a lot,\" Kirkhart sighs. \"We can do better.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5600733","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Many Would-Be Buyers Are Frozen Out of the Housing Market","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new report from the National Association of Realtors reveals a significant shift in the housing market: first-time homebuyers are aging to an average age of 40 — an all-time high — and now represent only about 20% of home sales, down from a generation ago.

Among first-time buyers, the average age was 40 —  an all-time high.   First-time buyers accounted for only about one in five homes sold during the 12 months ending in June.  That's a record low and half the share of first-time buyers a generation ago.   \"It shows some real problems in the housing market that need to be addressed,\" Lautz says. \"When we look at the lack of inventory for young adults to be able to purchase what ends up being their biggest financial asset and to bring them into the housing ladder, we have work to do.\"  Eve Burdick and husband Cael just celebrated their first wedding anniversary.

Burdick says by the time her parents were her age, they'd already been homeowners for several years.  But that's uncommon in today's market.   Part of the problem is that people who already own homes, often with much lower mortgage rates, are staying put longer than they used to — a record 11 years, on average, according to the new Realtors' report. That means fewer houses are available for new buyers. \"We see gridlock in today's housing market,\" Lautz says. The overall shortage of homes is compounded by the high price of other necessities, which makes it hard for first-time buyers to save up a down payment.  And many are already saddled with other debt.   Eve Burdick and her husband are paying off both student and medical debt. She was also out of work for a few months, which took a big bite out of the couple's savings.  \"So we feel much more behind,\" Burdick says. \"We thought we'd be buying a house in a year.

A new report shows people are waiting until they're much older to buy that first home than in past years. The report underscores how challenging it's become for young people to get a foothold in the costly housing market, as NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Eve Burdick and her husband, Cael, just celebrated their first wedding anniversary. They're both 30 years old and at the stage of life when they'd like to be shopping for their first home. In fact, Eve Burdick has been window-shopping. EVE BURDICK: Oh my gosh, all the time. Are you kidding me? (Laughter) I am on Zillow. My mom sends me stuff pretty much multiple times a week (laughter). HORSLEY: But even though home prices in Minneapolis, where the couple lives, are below the national average, everything they look at is far above their price range or needs more fixing up than the couple could afford. BURDICK: There is no feasible way that we could buy a house for $350,000 and then pull a home equity line of credit to drywall the basement. HORSLEY: Burdick says by the time her parents were her age, they'd already owned a home for several years. But in today's pricey market, that's uncommon. A new report from the National Association of Realtors says the average person buying their first home this past year was 40 years old - an all-time high. Deputy Chief Economist Jessica Lautz says the association had to scrap the photo that was supposed to go on the cover of the report. JESSICA LAUTZ: The original cover had a very cute young couple who was expecting, and I said, that's not going to work. We're not seeing young couples, unfortunately, so it didn't match. HORSLEY: Instead, the realtors went with a photo showing a couple near retirement age, more representative of today's average buyer. Lautz says first-time buyers accounted for just 21% of home sales during this past year. That's a record low and about half the share of first-time buyers a generation ago. LAUTZ: It shows some real problems in the housing market that need to be addressed. For young adults to be able to purchase what ends up being their biggest financial asset and to bring them into the housing ladder, we have work to do. HORSLEY: Part of the problem is that people who already own homes, often with much lower mortgage rates, are staying put longer - a record 11 years on average. That means fewer houses are available to new buyers, a situation Lautz describes as gridlock. The overall shortage of homes is compounded by the high price of other necessities, which makes it hard for first-time buyers to save up a down payment. Many are also saddled with student or medical debt. Sasha Skelton's 34. Her partner's 36. She works in HR for a bank. He's in property management. Skelton wishes they'd been able to buy a home a few years ago when interest rates were lower, but they were repeatedly outbid, often by older, wealthier buyers. Today, she says, everything in their Richmond, Virginia, suburb seems so expensive. She's also nervous about the job market and the overall economy. SASHA SKELTON: It makes me cautious about really wanting to take a jump where, if we have our jobs fall out from underneath of us, our house could be taken away. And, like, with the increase in groceries, it's just everything is kind of coming all at once, it feels like. HORSLEY: For now, Skelton and her partner have put house-hunting on the back burner. But they haven't given up. SKELTON: Both him and I have moved around a lot. I was an Army brat, so it would be nice to, like, settle down and have a home where we can, like, kind of put our roots in. It's just the market right now is not where we want it. HORSLEY: Mortgage rates have been inching down in recent months, but they're still more than twice as high as they were a few years ago. Meanwhile, the average home price just keeps going up. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

So many of you told me to pray to St. Anthony, the patron saint of lost objects — a tip that my grandma has sworn by since I was a kid. Others had some very practical advice: Look in coat pockets, lay a flashlight on the floor (if you've lost a tiny object, the beam may cast a large shadow) and — here's a good one — make sure you know what it looks like! \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Here's a roundup of advice from our audience on how to look for stuff — plus a few bonus tips from our experts. We hope this helps you quickly find whatever you're searching for. These responses have been edited for length and clarity. For science-backed and expert-recommended techniques to find missing objects, listen to the podcast episode above, or  read the original story here .  What to do if you've lost a wallet  Look up your last credit card transaction, and then go to the place where you last spent the money and look around there. — Darryl Ellis, a private investigator and the head of  A-1 Detective Agency  in Illinois Watch things fall as you drop them  I have trained myself to watch things fall when I drop them. If you watch a small screw fall and see where it lands and bounces, you will have no trouble finding it. If you just look at the place where the screw was supposed to go and growl and curse, expect to have trouble finding it. — Gregory Vogt Don't ever put it in a \"special place\" The worst possible thing to do is to place something of value in a \"special place\" that is \"easy to remember\" for \"safekeeping.\" Ha! Definitely not recommended. — Shan Crockett Use a flashlight  I find a flashlight to be a useful search aid, day or night. The beam forces me to focus on a limited area. It helps me see, instead of just looking. Held near the floor, it makes things shine. A girlfriend once lost her contact outdoors, in a driveway, with snow on the ground. I waited until after dark and then quickly found the contact in a snow pile at the edge of the street. — Art Clack  Start cleaning My mother taught me this tip: When you cannot find something, clean up and you will find it. I often find the item when I'm picking up something to put it back in its proper place. — Anne Chevalier \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Check favorite hangout spots Go to the places you hang out most and look there first. Do you have a favorite place you sit on the sofa? Look through the cushions and under and behind the sofa. Do you hang out on the patio? Look in between seats and chairs or on tables outdoors. My youngest son is autistic and nonverbal. He wears glasses and sometimes comes up to me without them on his face. To look for them, I always go to his favorite places around my home. They might be in his bed, his sensory swing or the closet. I always end up finding them. — Naeemah Ford Goldson, executive director and founder,  National Association of Black Professional Organizers Make a mental note of something you're likely to lose  I make a mental note when I put something down — like my keys, glasses or phone — in a place I do not usually put it. It is akin to underlining or highlighting something in writing to help make it easier to remember. — Marc R. Inver Come back to it  Take a break from looking for your missing object and relax or do something else. Without worrying and fussing, your brain will quietly surprise you with a stored memory that will suddenly pop into your consciousness and lead you to the missing object. — Gregory Vogt Look carefully in the most obvious place Look in the most likely place it should be. Most of the time, it's there. You just overlooked it. — Kelly Connolly Make sure you know what it looks like Numerous times, my wife has sent me to get something in the basement, and I can't find it at first because she told me the wrong color, container or location. Make sure you know the correct characteristics, or you may easily overlook what you are looking for. — John Heinen The digital story was edited by Meghan Keane. The visual editor is Beck Harlan.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. A few years ago, our digital editor, Malaka Gharib, lost her passport two days before a big international trip. Getting a new passport expedited would cost her hundreds of dollars, and she wasn't sure if it would even get to her in time. MALAKA GHARIB, BYLINE: You can imagine how stressed I was. I mean, the last time I saw my passport was on the bed, but I retraced my steps about a dozen times and nothing. SEGARRA: She was so stressed about the missing passport, she even took off work to look for it. GHARIB: I mean, I was really frazzled. I tore up the house, and I was checking the most random places, like the bathroom cabinets. SEGARRA: That experience made Malaka think, you know, there has to be a more methodical way of finding lost objects. GHARIB: Right. I mean, like, what do researchers know? And what about people like detectives and search-and-rescue responders? How do they hunt stuff down? SEGARRA: On this episode of LIFE KIT... (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...How to find the stuff you've lost. And we're not just going to tell you to look harder if you've lost something. Malaka will bring you useful techniques to find things that don't have an AirTag on them, whether that's something sentimental like a class ring or something valuable like an envelope full of cash or something you need to cross the border. GHARIB: And I'll reveal how I finally found my missing passport. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: So after I called my boss and told them I wasn't coming in, I went into my bedroom, where I lost my passport, and I turned it upside down. I remember feeling so overwhelmed that I wasn't looking carefully enough. That's exactly what you want to avoid when you're looking for a lost object. This is takeaway one. Your attention is like a spotlight, and you need to be able to point it at the task at hand. To do that, you've got to relax, which, I know, is the last thing you want to hear when you've lost something important. Arryn Robbins is a cognitive psychologist at the University of Richmond, and she specializes in visual search. She says that stress clouds our ability to focus. ARRYN ROBBINS: Stress can have a couple of different types of effects on us. So imagine you're highly distracted because you're thinking about something that's coming up. GHARIB: Like a big international trip that you're packing and getting ready for. ROBBINS: That type of distraction, that mental distraction is taking away attentional resources from the task at hand. GHARIB: So I was already frazzled when I was handling my passport to begin with. Then I realized I lost it, which was my second layer of stress. ROBBINS: In terms of visual processing, when you are stressed out, you have that sort of fight-or-flight response kicking in. That sympathetic nervous system is kicking into gear. Your heart is beating a little faster. You might get a little sweaty because you're anxious. What that does is it actually narrows your attention. GHARIB: So, if your attention is like a spotlight, you could increase the size of that beam or shrink it down. When it's narrow, it's almost like you're having tunnel vision. On one hand, that can be great. You're able to process your environment with a lot more detail. ROBBINS: But you, to some degree, need your attention sort of expanded in order to get the gist of your search environment to know where to put that spotlight next. GHARIB: So take a moment to widen that beam. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ROBBINS: It helps to take a breath, kind of calm the body down because it really is your body response to that stress that's causing that restriction in attention. GHARIB: Once you've calmed down and centered yourself again, it's time to start hunting. Takeaway two, if you've lost something important, think about the features of the object that would really make it stand out in the environment. Arryn says it'll make your search easier and more efficient. ROBBINS: When you are looking for objects, you're using a bunch of different cognitive processes in your brain, but the two most important ones are memory and attention. GHARIB: You're going to rely on your memory to remind you of what the lost object looks like and its likely location. ROBBINS: Its visual features like color, shape, texture, size, memory for where the object is most likely going to be, and that information in memory is used to direct your attention. GHARIB: Say you're looking for a white sedan in the parking lot. To find it, you're not going to look at every single car in the lot. ROBBINS: Your attention is going to be directed to cars that are white, that are sedan-shaped. You're going to skip over the black SUVs, and that helps you save time. GHARIB: This is what scientists call attentional guidance. It's the process of moving your attention toward areas in your environment where you'd most likely find your object, including important features of your object and where you tend to keep the object. It's something we do all the time without even realizing it, when we look for a toothbrush in the morning or a favorite coffee mug. You only realize you're looking for something when it becomes challenging - for example, when you're looking for a white sedan in a parking lot full of white sedans. ROBBINS: So in that case, you have to really think about what would make this object stand apart in the scene? What are some distinctive features of this object? Maybe you have a bumper sticker that sets it apart. GHARIB: Arryn used this tactic recently when she lost the back of a rose gold earring on a carpet in a similar color. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ROBBINS: So I had to think about, OK, what would set my earring apart from this carpet that would allow me to find it? Well, my earring is shiny. It would reflect light. And so, as soon as I thought about that, like, almost instantly, I saw it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: OK. So you've tried this technique, and you still can't find what you're looking for. Time for takeaway three - think about the likely scenarios of how and where your object got lost. Demian Garcia is a metal-detecting enthusiast. For more than a decade, he's been using his metal detector to help people where he lives in Northern California find their lost jewelry in some pretty challenging environments - parks, beaches, roads. His track record is impressive. Over the years, he says he's helped recover some 50 lost objects for folks. When people pay him to find a lost object - he charges around 25 to 35 bucks a search - he starts off by asking them questions. DEMIAN GARCIA: Do you have any locations that you put it normally? Have you lost it before? Has it fallen off before while doing something? You know, some people say, oh, yeah, it always slips off when I'm in my car, and I play with my ring while I'm driving. GHARIB: Then he goes through typical ways people lose rings off their hand. He's got a lot of experience in the behavior of rings, as you can imagine. GARCIA: Did you throw anything away that day? Were you dealing with cold water? Did you put on lotion somewhere? GHARIB: And one of my favorite ways that Demian helps people find their lost jewelry without the use of a metal detector is to recreate the scene. GARCIA: An example of that was a couple were pulled over on the side of the road, and she tossed the ring out in the passenger seat. GHARIB: Side note - Demian says this scenario happens a lot. Couples get into an argument, and one of them takes off their wedding band and chucks it out the window in anger. But then they make up, and then they can't find where they threw their ring. So they contact Demian. GARCIA: And she kept going, it's right there. I threw it straight out the window right there. GHARIB: Demian wondered, was it really right there? He wanted to test the theory, so he took a cheap ring, tied a long red ribbon on to it and asked the woman to throw the ring out the window again like she did with her wedding ring. GARCIA: Well, she threw it three times in a row, and it never went straight out the window, like you would think. It went flying back behind the car because of her arm going out the window makes her hand throw it towards the back of the car. So it went back about 20 feet to the rear of the car, going a different direction. GHARIB: Using this technique, he was able to find the woman's ring. Yay, Demian. So the next time you lose something, try recreating the potential movement of the object. I should've done that with my passport. I could've taken something similar to it, like a little booklet or something, laid it on my bed, the last place I saw it, and I could've ruffled the duvet cover around to see where something of that size and weight might have landed because where I ultimately found it was not that far from my bed, actually. More on the exact spot later. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: At this point in your search, you've probably looked in some pretty obvious places. Now it's time to change your perspective and scour elsewhere. This is takeaway four. Michael Hout is a cognitive psychologist and the director of the Vision Sciences and Memory Lab at New Mexico State University. He specializes in how people find things and where and why people move their eyes. He was telling me about this experiment that one of his students did. She had participants look for objects in a campus courtyard, and she found that people tended only to look at the ground when they searched. MICHAEL HOUT: So they're not looking up. They're just kind of walking in a straight line and sweeping back and forth with their head and their eyes in front of them. GHARIB: This is different from how search-and-rescue responders and law enforcement operate. These professionals scan their environment in 360 degrees. That means... HOUT: Looking down, looking up, looking left and right, crouching down to change your perspective, turning around to view things that weren't visible to you when you first approached them. GHARIB: He says if you've lost something, you need to engage in these kinds of perspective-changing behaviors, too. That also means looking in unexpected places. So if you can't find your keys in the places where you normally leave them - your purse, your pocket, the entryway table at the front door... HOUT: You also have to then sort of force yourself to look in the low-probability areas. I think sometimes people put their keys in weird places, or they drop them or someone moves them. GHARIB: Search-and-rescue responders use this technique when they look for missing persons in the wilderness. Instead of just looking on a trail for clues like footprints or a cell phone, they look up at the trees and off the beaten path. HOUT: A windbreaker that someone shed when they were getting hot, for example, might have been picked up by the wind and blown into a bush or a tree. GHARIB: When I was looking for my passport, I actually checked inside the fridge. I know this sounds far-fetched, but maybe I was holding it, intending to put in my backpack, got hungry and then brought it into the kitchen with me. No, I did not find it in the fridge, but it was still good that I did that anyway. This exercise is all about breaking out of the way you would normally search for something. HOUT: And that takes a little bit of additional effort to sort of force yourself out of the routine that you might automatically use to look for something. GHARIB: At this point, if you've looked in some weird places and you still can't find your lost object, it's time to bust out a more serious search technique. Takeaway five, divide your space up into sections and then search each section thoroughly. Arryn says grid search, as it's called, is one form of systematic search. It's sometimes used in search and rescue as a last resort to find missing people. But it can also be a useful tool if you're looking for something in a messy room, where your missing object's distinctive features may be hard to spot. ROBBINS: It's going to be slow, less efficient, but it's going to ensure that you find the thing that you're looking for. And so, in this case, you might imagine that your search environment, whether it's a room or an office space, is like a grid, and you want to cover each square in the grid, maybe top to bottom, left to right. GHARIB: Arryn says the general idea is to come up with a strategy to be thorough without having to remember every location you've already looked at. You don't necessarily have to measure out a grid. Just imagine breaking down the search environment into smaller units - sections of a room, pieces of furniture - then search those units in an order that makes sense to you. Arryn says you are likely going to forget where you searched, so have a way to remember the places you already sifted through. When I lost my passport in my bedroom, I deployed a similar strategy. I divided the room into sections, and I put a Post-it note where I had already looked. Arryn thought that was an excellent strategy, but did I find my passport with this method? No. Looking back on my journey to find my passport, I realize I did one thing right. I was persistent. That's our final takeaway, takeaway six - be persistent. GHARIB: Darryl Ellis is head of A-1 Detective Agency in Illinois. He's been a private investigator since 1996. His whole job is to find stuff, people, to, say, serve them legal papers, but sometimes physical items like vintage cars and important documents. I asked him what it takes to be a good detective. DARRYL ELLIS: If I had to use one word, I would say tenacity. It's my client asking me to do a - perform a service for them, and I try to do my best to locate anybody that they're requesting me to locate. GHARIB: Darryl can spend hours doing surveillance, following targets, taking photos of them, logging their whereabouts, weeks tracking down information about the location of a specific individual. ELLIS: I mean, I'm looking for a gentleman now I've been looking for for a month, and we've, you know, pulled out all the resources trying to locate him. I've been to five or six addresses, and he hasn't lived there. GHARIB: Darryl says he'll keep looking as long as his clients want him to. But Demian says sometimes they give up before he does. GARCIA: Sometimes, they don't have the patience. And they're, you know, an hour into it, two hours into it, and I'm on my hands and knees and crawling through bushes and stuff, and they're looking at me like, you don't have to go anymore looking and you don't - you know, they're kind of like, well, I guess it's gone, and I just tell them, no, no, I don't give up until I'm satisfied. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: So if you've lost something you really care about, keep going. Don't lose hope. When I was looking for my passport, I remember sitting on my bed and looking around the room. At this point, it was about 3 p.m. and my brain was fried. There were Post-it notes everywhere. I had emptied all the drawers in my cabinet to see if the passport was in there. And I just had this moment of clarity. The passport has to be near the bed. It has to be, because that's where I last saw it, and I don't remember taking it anywhere else. So I pushed the mattress off the bed, and where did I find it? Wedged between the wall of the bed and the side of the mattress. Hallelujah. Reflecting back on that wild, wild search, I truly believe that if I had these tips I just gave you, I would have found it a lot faster. And listen, if you don't find the object you're looking for, hold on to the fact that you tried really, really hard to find it. That's what Demian does. GARCIA: It may help to know that I did my best to look for it, you know, and not to spend time looking in areas that I have looked, and, you know, maybe it'll show up someday. Or if not, you know, you did the best you could. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: Let's recap. Takeaway one, your attention is a spotlight. You need to be relaxed so you can widen your beam and stay focused on your search. Takeaway two, speed up your search by identifying the qualities of your missing object that make it stand out from the environment. Takeaway three, search the obvious. Think about the likely scenarios of how and why your object might have gotten lost to begin with and where it might be. Takeaway four, change your perspective. Professional finders like search-and-rescue responders don't just look at the floor. They look behind, they look above, and they look off the beaten path. Takeaway five, create a systematic way of searching for your lost object. Divide your room into a grid, search each square thoroughly and use Post-it notes to mark where you've already looked. And, finally, takeaway six, don't give up. Be persistent, just like our detective and our metal-detecting enthusiast, and you'll hopefully find what you're looking for.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MELANIE LANGFORD: And when you look at those dots, I'm going to show you two choices. And I just want you to tell me which makes the edges sharper and clearer for you. ANDEE TAGLE, HOST:   OK. LANGFORD: Do those look clearer with one or two? TAGLE: One. Hey there, this is Andee Tagle in for Marielle Segarra and reporting from the office of optometrist Melanie Langford here in San Diego, Calif. When you think about eye health, this is usually the image that comes to mind - right? - sitting in a dark office in a big leather chair, two great big wheels of lenses in front of your face making you feel like an owl, and little rows of letters across the room making you sweat. There's no way they'd put three Z's in a row - right? LANGFORD: And seven or eight? TAGLE: Eight. LANGFORD: OK, perfect. So you do not appear to have any astigmatism. TAGLE: What's astigmatism again? This part, the eye exam part of eye care, is for the average healthy-sighted person. Pretty straightforward and, in my opinion, pretty cool. LANGFORD: So you're nearsighted. TAGLE: OK. LANGFORD: And then this is what your... TAGLE: Whoa. LANGFORD: ...Vision is with nothing. TAGLE: I can't - that's crazy. Big difference. LANGFORD: And that's with it. TAGLE: I can see. LANGFORD: Perfect. TAGLE: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: If you talk to just about anyone who works in the field, they'll tell you - there's a lot more to eye health than meets, well, you know. Eighty percent of what we learn about the world comes in through our visual pathway. We need our eyes to perform our daily activities, do our jobs, to navigate the world around us. So eye care is so much bigger than just a prescription or an annual eye exam. So in this episode of LIFE KIT, eye health. We'll talk about how to combat eye fatigue. We'll separate eye facts from fiction. And we'll set our sights on daily practices to strengthen and enjoy our vision. Eyeballieve (ph) you're going to learn a lot. I know - one too many puns, right? I'll see myself out. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: A quick note - while this episode contains general healthy practices for sighted adults, it isn't medical advice. So if you have any worries about your eyes or your vision, you should go see your doctor. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: All right, let's jump right in with the big one first, shall we? I know you're thinking about it. I'm guessing that's why you clicked here. Yep, it's screen time. Takeaway one - screen time is hard to avoid, but digital eyestrain doesn't have to be. To give your eyes the rest they need, take lots of breaks and be mindful of your visual space. My seemingly endless scrolling and surfing throughout my day was actually the genesis for this episode - phones and iPads and TVs and laptops. Being glued to these rectangles of light for hours and hours every day just cannot be good for our eyes. In fact, it's such a problem that the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the National Eye Institute predict that half the world's population - half of everybody - will be nearsighted by the end of 2050. Screens are a potential culprit here. VALERIE LAM: So there's two systems being engaged when you are focusing so hard on the computer screen. TAGLE: That's Valerie Lam, an optometrist in Costa Mesa, Calif., whose practice also includes vision therapy - a nonsurgical approach to certain eye conditions like lazy eyes or binocular vision. LAM: So convergence is for our eyes to pull together to look at something that's close. Our computer screens are usually about 16 to 20 inches away from our eyes. That is a very near target. A very near target has a lot of demand on our eyes to be able to focus and line up. TAGLE: The other system is our accommodation system, which is kind of like the zoom feature of your eyes. LAM: It zooms in to make things look clear, just like a zoom of a camera. TAGLE: So together, these two systems pull together and zoom in. LAM: And they're holding that position for eight hours a day. That's why people feel eye fatigue or, you know, they get headaches above their eyebrows. They feel like they want to rub their temples at the end because your vision system is working so hard throughout the day. TAGLE: So what Valerie is describing is something called digital eyestrain, and it happens when you stare at screens for too long. You might get a headache. Your eyes will feel dry. You might even have neck or shoulder pain. But there's no need to fret. We've got solutions for you. The first one is catchy. You might have heard the phrase before - 20-20-20. That means for every 20 minutes of work, take a 20-second break and look 20 feet away. LAM: And why do we say 20 feet away? Because we feel like that's equal to distance, right? When your eyes are looking far away, your eyes are more relaxed. TAGLE: Simple enough. Another thing to consider is how you set up your workspace. Lots of people invest in fancy chairs or ergo keyboards. LAM: But, like, what about the ergonomics for your eyes, right? If you're on a workstation - if you have your computer screen, and behind you is a wall, there's no way for your eyes to rest. What if you were putting your computer next to a window? TAGLE: You want to think about the position of your monitor. The top of the screen should be at or just below eye level. Control for glare and brightness, too. Then, you might consider giving your eye muscles a little workout every now and again. Valerie's got an easy one for you. LAM: And we call it thumb rotations. And all you need is really your thumb. And what you're going to do is you're just going to put your thumb straight ahead of you, and you're going to make a big circle with your thumb. And you're going to follow, watching your thumb with your eyes. You're going to put your thumb in a big circle - like, up to the top of your head, out to as far as your arm can reach out to the side, and then down to the bottom. That's engaging all six of your eye muscles while you're doing that stretch. So we tell patients - we'll say do five circles with your right thumb, and then switch to the other hand and do five circles with your left thumb, going in the outward direction, so you'll go up and out. TAGLE: Then there's blue light. This is a super hot topic in the eye world. Maybe you're one of the many, many people who went out and got a pair of blue light glasses to protect your eyes in the beginning of the pandemic. Here's the thing. RUPA WONG: There have been absolutely no studies that have demonstrated any kind of negative effect of blue light on your retina, on your cataracts, on your macula. TAGLE: That's Dr. Rupa Wong. She's an ophthalmologist and clinical associate professor at the University of Hawaii John Burns School of Medicine. WONG: I think people get a little confused with ultraviolet light and blue lights from that perspective. But what blue light does is it affects your melatonin. It affects your circadian rhythms. TAGLE: So if blue light from a computer screen is in your sleep space, it might interrupt your bedtime routine just like a lot of sunshine might get in the way of a nap. But other than that, it's not really something to worry about, says Rupa. WONG: Digital eyestrain - so once we remove that aspect from digital eyestrain - because there was some thought that maybe it was related to the blue light - really, it comes down to the fact that, when we are on devices, whether it be a computer or a phone or a tablet, we tend not to blink as much, and we are focusing up close for many hours at a time. TAGLE: Blinking is a lot more important than you think it is. WONG: When we're not blinking as much, your eyes get drier. TAGLE: I know - doesn't sound like a very big deal. WONG: So the amazing thing is that your tear film is responsible for a good part of the clarity of your vision. When you have dry eyes, the vision becomes blurry, and this is something that we often see. People don't come in saying, I have dry eyes. They come in oftentimes saying, my eyes hurt, or my vision is blurred. But it comes and goes throughout the day, or when I blink, it gets a little bit better. So the ramification of having dry eyes can be really profound. And really, when you get very severe dry eyes, there are a lot of different medical problems that can be associated with severe dry eye syndrome. TAGLE: I stand corrected. Excuse me while I take 20 seconds to blink a bit. Some other options for making sure your eyes stay moist throughout the day - you could keep artificial tears handy. Not eyedrops - there is a difference. But there have been recalls lately, so you might want to do a quick search before you buy. You could also give yourself, like, a mini spa treatment at the beginning and the end of each day by putting warm compresses over your eyes. That can help moisturize the oil glands on your eyelids that you need to make oil for your tears. WONG: Do it at least for five minutes. Morning and night just might help, and it's an easy thing. It helps even for people who have allergies. I mean, there's a lot of different ways that - just having that lubricant in your tear film can be a benefit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Up next, eye hygiene - let's talk dirty details about keeping your eyes clean. They're the windows to the soul, after all, so let's make sure we treat them accordingly. Takeaway two - protect your peepers. Bacteria, sun, wind and lifestyle choices can all affect these two small, precious organs. Let's start with bacteria. I'm looking at you, contact lens wearers. WONG: When you sleep in your contact lenses, you're increasing your risk of infection of the cornea up to eight times. I've heard people, oh, I sleep in my contacts all the time, and I've never gotten an infection. Well, you're very, very lucky. That's great. But it really is setting up the perfect environment for all these microorganisms to grow and replicate. They like a nice, moist environment. So think about that image in your head before you sleep with your contact lenses. TAGLE: Rupa says usually the healthiest, though also often the most expensive and packaging-heavy option, is a daily contact. WONG: And that's because the lens material that it's made of is going to have a higher oxygen permeability. TAGLE: If you have two-week lenses or monthly lenses, she says it's important not to try and stretch the timing of them. The clock starts the minute you open the package. And remember, regardless of which type of contact you wear, life happens. So before you find yourself without contact solution or your carrying case, or the next time you want to take a nap on a plane... WONG: Just always, always, always - people need to have a good set of glasses because I think the biggest issue with wanting to take out your contact lenses at the end of the day is this - they don't have an up-to-date glasses prescription. TAGLE: Another bugaboo for eye doctors? Makeup. WONG: My ethnicity is Indian. They are all into the really tight lining, water lining, the big, dramatic eyes. So we can do all of this keeping your eyes healthy. The most important thing is to remove and wash your makeup every single night without fail. TAGLE: I'll admit I was pretty loosey-goosey about this before, and then Rupa told me this thing. WONG: They've done studies and they have shown there are Demodex lash mites that live on your lashes that come out at night. TAGLE: Lash mites - they love mascara. Look it up if you dare. Another big no-no is putting eyeliner on your waterline. That's the pink part of your eyelid. WONG: I love that look. It's not one that we recommend because it can block the oil glands of your eyelids. It can cause styes. It can cause issues with dry eyes. Also, those loose glitter eyeshadows, they tend to really fall into the eye in a lot of particulate matter. So usually, I would avoid the loose ones as well. You can do glitter shadows. The pressed ones are going to be a bit better. TAGLE: Other best practices include regularly cleaning your applicators and brushes and actually following the expiration dates on your mascara and other eye makeup. And they might be shorter than you think. Check your boxes. Most dates run somewhere in the range of three to 12 months. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Moving on to sun damage. It is no joke. Exposure to the sun, even in small amounts, over time can lead to serious eye problems, like cataracts or macular degeneration. You can develop callus-like tissue on the whites of your eyes from too much sun, dust or wind. WONG: And we can't forget the eyelid and the external structures of the eye because you can get cancers on those part of the eye, which is why sunglasses and hat use is so important. TAGLE: Rupa suggests wearing hats with at least a three-inch brim when you're outside for an extended period of time and to be cognizant not only of direct sunlight, but also things like exposure to glare or reflection from the road. Then there are sunglasses. Are they all created equal? WONG: They are not. The most important thing about sunglasses is it has a little sticker on it that says 100% UVA, UVB. TAGLE: Polarized sunglasses will make your eyes more comfortable, especially if you're wearing them in a place with a lot of glare. But be warned, unless they also specifically say UVA and UVB, you're not getting the sun protection you need. Other lifestyle factors that affect your eyesight, like diet and exercise, don't require any super special ingredients or supplements. Yes, what you've always heard is true, carrots are good for your eyes, but... WONG: It's not just about the carrots. And the beta-carotene that you get from carrots is also present in things like sweet potatoes and cantaloupe and spinach and tomatoes. TAGLE: When it comes to healthy practices, Rupa says don't overthink it. WONG: All the things that you would think about for the lifestyle factors - that if you're aiming for a healthy life. Just getting good sleep, being able to, you know, not smoke and just exercising has been shown just the same to affect your eye health just as much as it affects the rest of your body. TAGLE: Now let's turn to prescriptions - because I don't know about you, but every time I walk out of my eye doctor's office, I look at that little piece of paper, and I'm like, what in the name of middle-school science am I looking at right now? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Let's go over what you actually need to know. WONG: This was my favorite class in sixth grade. This is probably why I went into ophthalmology. I love optics so much. TAGLE: Takeaway three - understand your prescription. When you receive your prescription, you'll see two rows, OS and OD. Very simple. OS, oculus sinister, is Latin for left eye, and OD, oculus dexter, is Latin for right eye. No idea why it's necessary to be in Latin, but I digress. Your prescription can be different for each eye. Then you'll see a plus or minus number. A plus prescription means you're hyperoptic - or farsighted. In this case, you might have trouble seeing close up or even at medium distance because... WONG: The eyeball is a little bit short. So we put a stronger plus lens in front of the eye to bring that light so that it can focus onto the retina instead of behind the retina. TAGLE: If you have a minus prescription, you're myopic - or nearsighted. That means you have trouble seeing far away because... WONG: The eyeball itself is shaped a little bit longer. And because of that, we use a minus lens to push the light back so it's on the retina. TAGLE: In general, the higher your number in either direction, the worse your natural vision and the stronger the lens you'll need to be able to see clearly. But Rupa says, in particular, your doctor is going to want to keep an eye on nearsightedness - that's that minus prescription - because, in that case, your retina might be stretched more thinly than the average eye. Anything from a 0 to a -3 is considered a mild prescription; -3 to -6 is moderate. WONG: And then anything above a -6 really puts you in a very different risk category of high myopia, where you can get retinal tears, retinal detachments, cataracts, glaucoma. So anybody that's a -6 diopter or higher, then we want to make sure we're following them at least once a year, for sure. TAGLE: Now there's one more condition to be aware of on your prescription - astigmatism. WONG: So many people get really concerned about astigmatism. They worry about it. They say, oh, my gosh, doctor, I have astigmatism. And they think it's a really terrible diagnosis, and it's not. All it is is the shape of the front surface of your eyeball. TAGLE: Regular-shaped corneas are shaped like half a basketball. But people with astigmatism - their corneas look more like half a football. WONG: And because of that, the light's getting diffracted into a lot of different points. And so to bring it all into one point, we use a cylindrical lens, and that helps focus the light onto the retina. You can be nearsighted with astigmatism or farsighted with astigmatism - either one. TAGLE: All combined, that prescription should be able to give you good, clear, hopefully 20/20 vision that can help you better navigate the world around you. Curious what 20/20 means exactly? Yeah, me too. Now, this is all arbitrarily set, but 20/20 refers to what the quote-unquote, \"average\" person can see at 20 feet away. So the first 20 refers to actual distance. The second 20 refers to how close an object appears. So if you can see 20/15, that means you can see at 20 feet what a, quote, \"normal\" person can see at 15 feet. How good can you get? LANGFORD: I can go all the way down to 20/10. TAGLE: Whoa. LANGFORD: Yeah, just super vision. TAGLE: Some people can just see that. Like, super vision. That looks like a pea. That looks like a ladybug... LANGFORD: I know (laughter). TAGLE: ...Across the room. People can see that from here? LANGFORD: A little black dot. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Now that we can all read our prescriptions, let's talk about what factors actually affect them because there are a lot of myths and misconceptions out there. Takeaway four - refract or fiction. Learn what can and cannot affect the quality of your vision. For example, maybe you have a parent or grandparent who avoids using their reading glasses for fear of becoming too dependent on them. WONG: They say, oh, look, I started wearing reading glasses, and then it just all went downhill. I can't even exist without them. It's not that you've made your eyes weaker. It's simply that, now, you see more clearly with your readers on, and you notice that difference. That's it. TAGLE: And the opposite is also true. So I'm slightly nearsighted, for example. My doctor prescribed me glasses for movies, concerts, driving at night, but I'm constantly forgetting them. Rupa says I don't have to worry about making my eyes worse by not wearing my glasses every time I'm supposed to. WONG: There's nothing about glasses that changes the structure or shape, or the muscles of the eye, or the focusing ability of the eye. It's not going to change it. TAGLE: That's a relief. Though, when you do wear your frames, you're going to want to make sure you have an up-to-date prescription. WONG: If it's an old glasses prescription, it might give you some eye fatigue, it might give you eyestrain. Maybe it might give you a headache because you have to strain to see a little bit better if it's really old. But typically, it's not going to cause any lasting damage. TAGLE: Generally speaking, Rupa says that most prescriptions will stabilize around early adulthood, but that's not always the case. So let's break down what can change the quality of your vision. Some conditions, like cataracts, can be age-related. Excessive smoking and drinking have been linked to a number of eye diseases that could then worsen your vision. There are also some medical conditions that will do the same - high blood pressure, for one. WONG: And then if you have conditions like diabetes, that actually can affect the lens of your eye and can make you nearsighted. So there are a lot of medical issues. TAGLE: And then there's one more, which we've kind of delved into already. WONG: And near work is associated with becoming nearsighted. TAGLE: Near work is what it sounds like - any work that you focus on up close, as in within arm's reach. So all that screen time we were talking about definitely falls under this umbrella. Video games, computer work, but also homework time, reading, drawing - all near work, too. The good news is the fix is as simple as you think it might be - just getting away from the desktop and getting outside. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Takeaway five, our final takeaway, is take your eyes outside - often. One of the very best ways to enjoy your sight and strengthen your vision is to take in the natural world around you. WONG: Being outside is so crucial, especially in my younger patient population. TAGLE: This might sound a little hyperbolic, but there's a lot of science backing this up, especially when it comes to young eyes. Recent research suggests that regular outdoor time for kids - up to two hours a day is what both Valerie and Rupa recommend - may help slow or even prevent nearsightedness. That's a big deal. There are a couple of theories as to why this is. One is that, when you're outside looking at nature, you're spending less time looking at things so close up. Your eyes are taking more things in at a distance, which is important for eye development and eye rest. The other theory is that sunlight slows eye growth, which could help eyes from unnaturally elongating, which is a cause of nearsightedness. OK, let's go outside. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR UNLOCKING) TAGLE: But then there's the fact that it just, you know, feels good. It's a beautiful day today, Teddy (ph). Do you see the cars going by? (SOUNDBITE OF CROW CAWING) TAGLE: Use your eyes to take in all the wonders around you. That's why bother with eye care at all. Do you want to play a little I spy? I spy a big tree. (SOUNDBITE OF CHILD SNEEZING) TAGLE: (Laughter) My 9-month-old hasn't really said as much yet, but I'm pretty sure he agrees with me. You're right. We don't have to say anything. We can just take it in, huh? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK, friends. Thanks for learning how to take care of those peepers along with me. Let's recap. Takeaway one - to avoid digital eyestrain, take lots of breaks and be purposeful about your visual workspace. Takeaway two, practice good eye hygiene. That means changing out those contacts, wearing those sunglasses, and - note to self - not wearing that winged eyeliner too close or for too long. Takeaway three - to understand your eyes, understand your prescription. No letters chart necessary. Takeaway four - separate eye fact from fiction. Glasses don't change the structure of your eye. Takeaway five - get out in the world and give your eyes a visual treat. The science says it's good for you, and your heart will say the same.

 \n           Monday, November 10, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         As President Trump calls for  National Guard deployments  across the U.S., a small contingent of Ohio guard members has been quietly expressing concern in an encrypted group chat. The administration started sending troops into several Democratic-led cities this summer, citing the need to crack down on violent crime and protect federal immigration facilities. The Ohio guard members now say they're alarmed at the turn the country is taking. They're even questioning their potential role in it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I really went to a dark place when they sent the troops to [Los Angeles], and then eventually [Washington, D.C.], and now, Chicago. This is just not what any of us signed up for, and it's so out of the scope of normal operations,\" says J, a member of the Ohio National Guard who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity. In the summer,  Trump sent troops  into Los Angeles as anti-ICE protests escalated. He then deployed guard troops into D.C., where around 2,300 still regularly patrol streets. Then a torrent of plans for deployments came —  Chicago ,  Portland ,  Memphis , cities in Louisiana and Missouri. Many of them remain embroiled in legal limbo. In Ohio, J and several other members have taken to that group chat to discuss the deployments and the accompanying anxiety they've felt. J, as well as members C and A — all part of the same unit — agreed to talk to NPR on the condition that they are only identified by their first initials, because they are not authorized to talk to the press and fear retribution for expressing their opinions. \"I have been on two humanitarian-esque missions with the guard, which were awesome, doing the things you see on the commercial, helping these communities,\" says J. \"And then you want me to go pick up trash and dissuade homeless people in D.C. at gunpoint. Like, no dude. It's so disheartening every time I see another city — and I just wonder, 'who's going to stand up to this?'\" It's a sentiment that's building with guard members elsewhere. In recent weeks, more than 100 active military members have reached out to  About Face , a nonpartisan nonprofit made up of current service members and post-9/11 veterans to be a resource for those who might be questioning their deployments, according to the organization. \"In the military culture, it's really easy to feel like if you have questions or dissent, you're the only person who thinks that,\" says director Brittany Ramos DeBarros, a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The group has started an information campaign, specifically targeting members of the National Guard around the country — using flyers, posters, even billboards — encouraging them to reach out if they're having doubts. \"We take very seriously making sure that people do understand what they could be facing if they follow their conscience,\" says DeBarros. \"But the thing we also help people think through is, what is the cost of not following your conscience? Because as Iraq and Afghanistan vets in particular, many of us are living with that cost every day.\" NPR reached out to both the White House and the Pentagon for this story. \"Our great National Guardsmen signed up to defend the nation and serve the American people,\" wrote Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson in a statement. \"We are proud of the work they have accomplished this year, and we are confident in their collective ability to carry out any and all orders by President Trump, the Department of War, and state leaders.\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the deployments, saying Trump was using his \"lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel.\" Jackson lashed out at Democratic leaders, saying they'd failed to stop violent attacks on law enforcement. The group chat The group chat with the Ohio National Guard members — set up on the encrypted messaging app Signal — began amid the  flurry of executive orders  President Trump signed as he took office. Some of them affected the military. The members say they needed a space to process it. \"It's not even necessarily expressing opinions or anything. It's just expressing questions about things that come out,\" says A. They say the chat is active every day, with members sharing information and news articles they come across. In recent months, that chat has grown to a dozen members of their unit, and it's become largely focused on Trump's rhetoric around the National Guard and his deployments of troops to several cities. Ohio's Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has agreed to send troops to support the administration's efforts; there are about 150 in DC right now. That voluntary directive has come to this unit. None of the three took it. They say the orders themselves were uncharacteristically vague. \"What exactly are we going to be doing? Are we going to have leave? And those answers aren't very clear — but in the past, it's always been very clear,\" says A. \"Anywhere that we go, there's crucial information that we get about the why behind it. And whenever we don't get that, especially for these city moves, members ask questions.\" Growing anti-guard sentiment A joined the guard to pay for college. J was looking for direction in life. And C felt the pull of the benefits that the guard offers and to serve her country. All three have served for years, even decades. The three say they are grappling with whether to leave the guard, and end their military careers. \"The only reason I want to finish my current contract is just because I feel like there's weight to what I do and say right now, and I just want to use that to do some good,\" says J. C says she has been proud of her military career and how she has served — noting that she's served on missions that she didn't necessarily agree with before. But she worries these deployments could change that. She says she's spent a lot of time thinking about what line she won't cross. \"I've been in therapy. Lots of therapy has taken me to the point where at least I can be okay if I have to say goodbye. That sucks. Is this tarnishing my service? Is it undoing everything I thought I was fighting for?\" she says. The three say they've felt anti-guard sentiment from some of their community and in their civilian lives. \"Everything that has been happening is so counter to doctrine, and so counter to what we've been taught,\" C says. Their thoughts The Trump administration has publicly talked about using the  National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration enforcement  — something broadly illegal under US law. That bothers the three guard members. \"There is no way I would participate in that,\" says J. \"I just think when everything is said and done, people are going to have to answer for what we're seeing now, and I don't want to be any part of it.\" A also says he's been wrestling with what he'd do if made to participate. \"I think, like, establishing those boundaries with yourself: What am I willing to do? What am I willing to give up? And where do I draw those lines?\" he says. The idea of troops patrolling U.S. streets — even if they're only picking up trash — is also problematic for the Ohio guard members. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's kind of like fearmongering. People who don't see people in uniform every day, you send 50 of them out to walk their street, it's going to send a message,\" J says. DeBarros, the director of About Face, says she knows the tactic well. \"In Afghanistan, we used to regularly carry out what are called presence patrols, where there was no purpose or mission other than to be present in the space and normalizing that we were there,\" she said. \"Letting people know, oh, if you act up, we are here, and we're watching.\" C has been thinking a lot about what she's willing to give up and the potential consequences. \"I swore an oath to the Constitution, not a person,\" she says. \"I just really, really implore my peers and everybody outside looking in, to just think about that. Really think about that, and think about what that means. And if there are questions, ask them. Keep talking.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/683530953","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"The Rise of the Urban Youth Movement: A Cultural Shift in City Life","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article highlights a growing cultural trend among urban youth, driven by increased engagement in creative and community-based activities.

Budgeting gets a bad reputation. \"The first image that comes to most people's mind is dieting or imprisonment,\" says Jesse Mecham, founder of the budgeting software  You Need A Budget . But that, Mecham says, is an inaccurate picture. \"Budgeting is not about being handcuffed. It's really about being liberated.\" It might just be empowering for you. Keeping tabs on where your money is going is a good first step to cutting back on spending and saving more, if you're able to do so.  These six budgeting tips will help you track your spending and make more informed decisions about your money — and your life.  1. Don't budget just because you think you should. If you're budgeting because you think that's what responsible grown-ups do, that's not super-concrete or motivational. Instead, set a specific goal that has meaning to you, like paying off credit card debt or student loans or saving for a vacation, says Kristin Wong, author of  Get Money: Live the Life You Want, Not Just the Life You Can Afford .  \"Now you have a reason to say  no  to that $50 dinner, because you have something to say  yes  to now,\" Wong says.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Boost Your Credit Card IQ  \n       2. Harness your freakout. Big life changes — a move or a job loss — can bring big stress. Leverage that anxiety by channeling it into motivation to adjust your budget. \"Those moments, where you have the willpower or you have the energy, you have this motivation,\" Mecham says. \"That motivation is fleeting.\" So take advantage of budgeting momentum while it lasts. If you mess up or overspend later on, don't quit. Mecham stresses the importance of being flexible: \"You just make adjustments, like a coach [at] a basketball game making halftime adjustments. You just adjust to how the team plays.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  Never Pay An Unnecessary Fee Again \n       3. Follow the 50-30-20 method. When you get started, try  the guidelines  that Sen. Elizabeth Warren helped develop as a Harvard University professor. The largest portion, 50%, of take-home income should go toward basic living expenses — housing, groceries, etc. Then 30% for discretionary expenses, like entertainment and clothes; and 20% for savings and paying down debt. 4. Use the power of scarcity. With credit cards and overdraft protections, \"we've gotten really used to the idea that we never really run out of money,\" Mecham says. But having a sense of scarcity can be helpful when you're trying to save. Remember back when you were a kid and all you had was that $5 from babysitting or mowing lawns? You were probably pretty careful about how you spent that money because once you did, it was gone. Try designating a certain amount of money for each budgeting category every month, and when you run out, it's out. 5. A roommate is worth a thousand coffees. It's unlikely you'll reach your budget goal just by cutting back on coffees. Housing, food and transportation are usually the biggest expenses. \"If you get a roommate or move to a cheaper place, those major decisions are going to save you so much more money,\" says Wong. \"They're harder decisions to make, obviously. But they give you more bang for your buck.\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  6 Simple Rules For Saving Money \n       6. Try different budgeting techniques to see what works for you. Whether it's a simple spreadsheet or a  budgeting app with lots of categories , use the system that works for you. Mecham says the main thing is not to wait until a \"normal month\" to get started — that will never come. So just start doing it, like right now. It's worth making a budget now, and if it changes in the coming months or year, that's OK.   You Need A Budget has been a sponsor of NPR in the past.

Oh, hang on, guys. I just got to enter this beer and my share of the nachos into my budget app. I mean, who wants to deal with that? But if it's such a drag though, why are some of you talking about budgeting like this? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I have had such a positive experience budgeting recently. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: And I am budgeting wizzard. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I'm actually super jazzed about it. It's, like, all I want to talk about. ARNOLD: A budgeting wizard, I love that guy. Super jazzed, all they want to talk about - what is going on with these people? What is their secret? This is your NPR LIFE KIT. This episode, budgeting - we're going to figure out how to join this party, how to convert a dreary, anxiety-producing, emotionally-fraught task into something conquerable, empowering and maybe even fun. We're going to learn how right after this. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: I'm Chris Arnold, and I cover personal finance for NPR. And in this episode, we're going to give you six tips for setting up and sticking to your budget. And our first big takeaway - call it tip number one - you need a goal. But it can't just be any goal - right? - because, I mean, you want to stick with this. You want to be a budgeting wizard. You need motivation. This is going to be fun. It can't be just any goal. KRISTIN WONG: It has to be something that's specific and meaningful to you. ARNOLD: That's Kristin Wong. She's written a book called \"Get Money.\" And she writes about personal finance for Lifehacker and other publications. And she says, you don't want to try to start a budget just because you think it's something that you should do. WONG: If you just have, like, a vague goal - like, oh, well, I mean, I need to be an adult. I need to be a responsible grown-up. You know, I think most of us when we start budgeting or start wanting to get our finances in order, that's the goal - the best goal that we come up, you know. Like, it's time to be an adult. And it's just not a goal that really serves us because it doesn't really mean anything. And, I mean, also who wants to be a responsible adult? (Laughter) That just doesn't sound fun. ARNOLD: Deep down, that's not really what we want. WONG: No. ARNOLD: Kristin says, pick a goal that actually is something that you really, really want. WONG: Like, maybe you want to get out of $10,000, $20,000 worth of student loan debt. Maybe you want to save up $3,000 for a trip to South America. Then on a Friday night, where you have nothing else to do, and your friends say, hey, let's go to this hip new restaurant. You know it's going to be 50 bucks, but you don't really have a good reason to say no except that, you know, this budget tells you not to. But when you have a goal like, OK, I want to save $3,000 for a trip to South America, well, now you have a reason to say no to that $50 dinner because you have something to say yes to now. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: OK. So a trip to South America is fun and exciting. But, of course, a lot of times what gets us serious about wanting to make a budget is that we're not having fun. There is, like, a moment of crisis or a huge life shift. This is our next takeaway - tip number two - if you are freaking out about money, harness the freakout. JESSICA FISHER: My water broke, and we had quite the experience. ARNOLD: That's Jessica Fisher (ph). She was on her way to the hospital, in labor obviously. And you know the scene - contractions, everybody's getting anxious. It probably didn't help that her husband pulled the car over to buy a burrito on the way to the hospital before they finally got there. FISHER: I started having contractions, you know, pretty frequently with not a lot of time in between them. And Ryan's sitting there eating his Chipotle and kind of making me mad. So I flipped to my phone. ARNOLD: And Jessica's feeling like, OK, we're having this baby. This is going to cost money - child care, someday college. I mean, burrito guy here is not looking terribly full of answers at the moment. FISHER: I was trying to not feel the contractions as bad, so I'm scrolling through Facebook in between contractions. And I see a post about a budgeting program, and it said it was on sale. It hit me right at that moment that this is what we need to do. This is what's going to make everything work. And I pass the phone to my husband. I said figure out how to buy this budgeting program. That kind of, you know, calmed me down a little bit because I really, you know, had started panicking about what we were going to do with three kids when we brought my youngest daughter home. JESSE MECHAM: I'll have to meet this woman at some point. (Laughter) That blows my mind. ARNOLD: That's Jesse Mecham. And that budgeting program that Jessica bought, he invented it. It's called You Need A Budget, or YNAB for short. And we should say the company's been a sponsor of NPR before. But we're talking to Jesse because YNAB has this vast community of loyal users - like, hundreds of thousands of people. And Jesse's interviewed a bunch of them, and it turns out, a lot of them are kind of like Jessica, having her baby and freaking out about money. MECHAM: Or they had decided they were going to move. Or the breadwinner lost a job. I think those moments where you have the willpower or you have the energy or whatever it is, you have this motivation, that motivation is fleeting. ARNOLD: It might be getting out of college and having to start paying student loans and feeling like, uh-oh, I've got to figure this out. But whatever it is, Jesse says harness that freakout. You have an impulse to knuckle down and get started and do it. And as you do it - and he says this is important - forget everything that you think you know about what making a budget is actually going to be like. MECHAM: I mean, the first image that comes to most people's mind is either dieting or imprisonment. And what we try and get people to think is budgeting's not about being handcuffed. It's really about being liberated to start to decide what you want to do instead of just reacting to everything that comes your way. And so it's not about saying, hey, don't spend here, don't spend there, cut back on this. Never eat out. None of that. It's just about saying, what do you really want? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: So those are our first two tips - what's your specific goal, the thing you really want? And use your angst for motivation. And we're talking to Jesse from YNAB, but there's also all kinds of other tools and apps out there. Mint is really popular. We've got a link to a free, simple spreadsheet you can use at /lifekit. And, look. If you're still like, budgeting, that's going to be a drag, I don't know, Jesse says, look, getting started can be pretty painless. And at first, all you want to do is just track where the money is going and kind of see what's going on. And he says sometimes it's best if you don't try to change too much, too fast. MECHAM: Especially don't cut back right away. You know, you're just getting started. You have someone that's been spending, I don't know, $1,200 a month on groceries, and then they come in and they say, we'll spend $500 'cause we're really serious. That's a recipe for disaster. You know, don't go zealot on me too quickly. ARNOLD: OK. So now, though, it is time to take out and sharpen your pencil. WONG: Then, you know, comes the dirty work of actually putting together the budget and deciding how your income gets divvied up among different categories. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: And Kristin says there's a good rule of thumb here that a lot of experts talk about. This is tip No. 3. We've got some numbers coming up here, but it's going to be OK. It's not that complicated. It's called 50-30-20. And Elizabeth Warren actually used to talk about this back when she was a Harvard professor and she was looking into the pressures that middle-class families face. And, all right, it's called 50-30-20. Here's how it works. WONG: It goes like this. Fifty percent of your after-tax, take-home income should go toward basic living necessities, like your rent, like your groceries, like your utility bill. ARNOLD: So that's easy. Half your income for the big fixed costs in life. WONG: And then 30 percent should go toward discretionary expenses - things that you don't necessarily need but you want, like your Netflix subscription, restaurant spending. You know, clothing, makeup. Stuff like that. ARNOLD: And then that last part, the 20 percent that's left over... WONG: Should go toward savings and debt goals. ARNOLD: And these are guidelines, a good place to start. The saving, of course, is going to be the hardest part for a lot of people. That is very tough, especially when you're not making that much money. But we have a whole episode just on how to save more money. There's a lot of good, high-value information in there. So check that out. But with this 50-30-20 thing, what you're doing here is you're starting to organize and place some limits on your spending. MECHAM: The budget is, it's a tool to manufacture scarcity regularly. ARNOLD: And like Jesse was saying, this is the part that people think is going to feel like handcuffs. But he says that pinch, that scarcity, that's actually really powerful. I mean, you could kind of think about like this. Like, remember when you were a kid and all you had was that $5 or $10 allowance, or money from babysitting or mowing lawns or whatever? You were probably pretty careful about how you spent that money because once you did, it was gone. MECHAM: This moment that we never experienced now, where you end up with zero dollars or really, really close to it. We've eliminated this scarcity because banks have introduced very profitable mechanisms to have you just walk past zero and overdraft a little bit and pay them a fee. Or you can just, if you run out of money in your checking account, you just swipe your credit card and you've walked past zero again. We've gotten really used to the idea that we never really run out of money. ARNOLD: So Jesse says this is the whole point of the budget, to get back to a world where we do run out of money, to feel that scarcity. And this is tip No. 4. You want to make the power of scarcity work for you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: So if your budget says $800 for groceries this month or $50 for coffee - whatever it is - that is way better than just looking at what's in your checking account. MECHAM: Absolutely, if, yeah, you never look at your checking account balance to see if you can spend anything. Because that's a big pile of money or small pile, whatever it may be. But it's a pile that doesn't tell you any information at all. All it tells you is what your checking account balance is. But it doesn't tell you if half of that money is reserved to pay a large bill that's coming up, and a little bit that's left over is to pay a preschool tuition and then you've got some left to pay the lights. And you're sitting there wondering if you should buy boots, you know? It shouldn't even be in the equation. So the moment I know someone's really got it is when they'll tell me, Jesse, I went to look to see if we should go out to eat, and we only had, you know, $20 in our restaurants category so we decided to get some pizzas instead. I felt broke. That phrase is great. They'll say, I feel broke because I can't go out to eat where I want to go out to eat at this moment, but my checking account has never been bigger. And that is where I say, OK, this person got it. They're manufacturing scarcity around the priority of how much should we spend on restaurants. But on the flip side, they've got money set aside to go on some great vacation where they'll get to enjoy themselves, guilt-free. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: Jesse says a key part of that story about the pizza is that you have to actively look at your budget as you go throughout the month so it can help you make decisions. Also you definitely want to have different categories in your budget but, Jesse says, don't go overboard. Like, does toothpaste go under health care? Or maybe under groceries? I know. Maybe I need, like, a hygiene category. MECHAM: And I'd say, whoa, whoa. (Laughter) You know? Whoa. Do you ever make a decision based on the information you are collecting? And if the answer is no, don't collect that information anymore. ARNOLD: But you are going to get some useful information as you go through and make your budget. And all of a sudden, as you're tracking your spending and you're seeing where all the money's going, Kristin says you want to go through, kind of like, a brushfire or doing some weeding and just get rid of stuff. I mean subscriptions, a magazine you don't read, some online service you signed up for that you just don't use. WONG: You know, my big one is candles from Target. I don't know why I love spending, I just - (laughter) like, the amount of money I spend on candles, yeah, is so stupid. ARNOLD: Jesse says everybody he talks to cuts back on one thing, for sure - going out to eat. MECHAM: Not one - not one - has ever said, well, we kept eating out at the same level, and we found our savings somewhere else. Every one of them cuts their eating out dramatically. ARNOLD: And now we're getting into our next big idea here. You want to go after the big stuff, too, and not just the little pick-me-up purchases and candles at Target. WONG: Where are you going to get the most bang for your buck when it comes to cutting back? If you look at the areas where you spend the most money - and think about, like, your rent, your housing, your food, transportation - those are, I think, the three biggest areas most of us spend money on. If you tackle - if you make one decision to cut back on any one of those areas, it's going to save you so much more money and time and energy than trying to cut back on coffee every day or avocado toast every week. Sometimes if you get a roommate or move to a cheaper place, those major decisions are going to save you so much more money. They're harder decisions to make, obviously. But they give you more bang for your buck. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: This is our next big takeaway here, tip No. 5. A roommate is worth a thousand cups of coffee. Or actually, maybe more, right? If you live in a city, a roommate could be $15,000 a year in money to help you pay your rent or your mortgage. And Kristin has walked the walk here. WONG: You know, I was one of those millennials that boomeranged (laughter) and moved back in with my mom when I was paying my student loan. I paid it off so much faster, and I saved so much money. And I'm very lucky. My mom doesn't charge me rent. We come from this culture where my mom would still have me living at home, if she could. But, you know, it's just, sometimes you have to give up what you think life should look like to think about what it could look like. ARNOLD: And sure, I mean, moving in with her mom was kind of a bummer in her mid-20s, but... WONG: Sometimes I do miss those, you know, Friday nights where we'd just sit at home, the two of us, and watch \"What Not To Wear\" and eat takeout. And, you know, I think about those memories now fondly. It wasn't that bad. It worked in my favor, and I was able to get out of debt and then focus on my career. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: When it comes to exactly how you organize and structure your budget, you can do this lots of different ways, right? I mean, super-detailed with a spreadsheet or a budgeting app with lots of categories, or you can keep it a lot more simple. We heard from a listener, Wendy Spitzer (ph), in North Carolina. And she's got a budgeting system that she calls week money, as in how much money she's going to spend this week. WENDY SPITZER: And in week money, every Friday, I take out an allotted amount of money from an ATM, and that money has to cover all daily living expenses for the upcoming week. So that would include needs like groceries, or gas for your car, transportation, as well as anything for fun money you might use in the course of the week. ARNOLD: Bigger expenses, like rent, car payments, utilities, that's not part of this. But everything else, she lumps into basically one big, simple category of money that she can spend this week. And if she makes an online purchase, she'll take the cash out of her wallet. And then when it's gone, no more eating out, no more impulse buys in the checkout line. And with this budget system, over time, Wendy has saved a lot of money. I mean, she has a very modest salary, and she was able to buy her own house. SPITZER: It was, I think, quite shocking to a lot of people I knew because I was living on such little money. But, like, you make a small change. It becomes a habit. You institute or implement that habit for many years. And I have been able to put a down payment for a house, and I have been able to save for retirement. So it's worked really well for me. ARNOLD: I'm a fan of Wendy's strategy here because it's simple, and I'm not like a super detail-oriented guy when it comes to tracking every single purchase and doing a budget. I mean, look. Planning for retirement - yes, the big stuff - but, you know, the little stuff, it's hard for me. I think it's hard for a lot of people. So this is our last big takeaway - tip number six. You want to try different things and find a budgeting system that works for you. So if you want to keep it simple, keep it simple. And people come up with their own systems all the time. I mean, Jesse's budgeting software YNAB, that evolved from just a spreadsheet that he created on his own to help him and his wife save money when they were still in school. And they just kind of stuck it up there on the Internet and tried to sell it. MECHAM: It launched as a very embarrassing spreadsheet that I love to look at still and... ARNOLD: Can you describe the spreadsheet? MECHAM: I don't want to because it's embarrassing. You know, Excel has so many colors you can choose, and I chose all of them in my first spreadsheet. You know, so it was just - it was a hideous cacophony of color and - but it worked. And it taught me that the tool is - it really plays second fiddle. And the first most important thing is your approach. And the effective thing about the tool that I built was that it forced us to approach our money, thinking about it in a different way. ARNOLD: Meaning thinking about budgets and money as a way to have the best life that you possibly can - the things that you really want with the money that you have. Whether that's more great vacations or paying off your student loans or saving up to buy a house, this is what makes budgeting feel fun. You get good at this, and it affects your life in a lot of good ways. And so to get there, Jesse says the main thing is look, just get started doing it, like right now, this month. MECHAM: I mean, life is - if it's not changing or abnormal, you know, we're probably dead or darn close to it. And people will often - they'll say, oh, I'm going to wait - let's wait for a normal month, honey, before we do blah or before we undertake this thing. And there just is no normal month ever. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: OK, so this is doable. We can do this budget thing. To help you remember the most important stuff, here's Kristin and Jesse with the key takeaways. Number one, you need the right kind of goal to help motivate you. WONG: Make sure that it's specific and meaningful to you. ARNOLD: Tip number two. WONG: If you have a big life event that is making you anxious or stressed about money, harness that stress and that anxiety and turn lemons into motivation. ARNOLD: Tip number three, a good place to get started with your budget... WONG: Is the 50-30-20 method - 50 percent of your take-home income goes toward basic living necessities, 30 percent goes toward discretionary expenses, your wants, and 20 percent goes toward saving and debt goals. ARNOLD: And tip number four - this is my favorite kind of big concept - use the power of scarcity. MECHAM: Don't view scarcity as a negative. Use the power of scarcity to help flesh out your true priorities. And don't think of budgeting as handcuffs. Think of it as freedom. ARNOLD: Number five. WONG: A roommate is worth 1,000 cups of coffee. ARNOLD: And our last one, number six. MECHAM: At the end of the day, you want to try different things and find out what works for you.

 Public safety groups face an uncertain future months after federal grant cuts \n         By Meg Anderson \n        \n           Monday, November 10, 2025 • 5:00 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Six months after the Justice Department cancelled  more than $800 million  in federal grant money, many groups on the receiving end are still reeling. The cuts, focused on community safety initiatives, affected hundreds of organizations around the country and were far-reaching in scope: school violence programs, training for rural police officers, resources for domestic violence victims and hate crime prevention. At the time, Attorney General Pam Bondi  said the department  was cutting millions of dollars in \"wasteful grants,\" highlighting efforts geared toward transgender and LGBTQ communities. NPR spoke with 10 affected organizations to see how they've fared. A few said their grants were reactivated, but most said they have had to lay off employees, dip into reserve funds, or shrink the services they offer. \"These cuts are significant and unprecedented,\" says Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and former head of the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs, the office responsible for the cuts. \"When an administration gives a grant to an organization, that is a promise for the full amount. And so organizations plan, they budget, they hire,\" she says. Instead, the DOJ cancelled these grants in the middle of their cycle. At Washington Technology High School in St. Paul, Minn., Principal Elias Oguz was shocked when a grant-funded position at his school was suddenly cut last spring. \"This was named the 'Stop The Violence' grant,\" he says. \"Who would want to cut the 'Stop The Violence' grant?\" The money had allowed him to hire Robyn Strowder as a restorative practices coordinator, to resolve conflicts between students and build community at the school. \"It was very nerve wracking,\" Strowder says. \"There was definitely a time that I was like, 'Hey, I have a whole family to provide for and I'm not sure if I have a job.'\" Oguz ended up putting $50,000 toward the position using money dedicated to school supplies, as well as other funds from the school district and community donations. Even so, he's not sure where the money will come from in future years. Oguz and Strowder are not the only ones grappling with that uncertainty. \"We have three other federal grants and know they could be terminated at any time without cause. If that happens, we will have to lay off staff and end services for participants,\" Nicky Fadley, executive director of the Virginia nonprofit Strength In Peers, told NPR in a statement. The organization, which supports people with substance use and mental health challenges, laid off two employees already. It had already spent about $90,000 of the terminated grant and is still waiting to be reimbursed for more than half of that amount. Many of the organizations NPR spoke with were in a similar situation, saying the DOJ has not reimbursed them for money already spent. Those that appealed the cancellations have not heard back. Several organizations  have sued the administration , saying the cancellations were unlawful and that they are owed thousands of dollars in outstanding expenses. In a statement, the Justice Department told NPR the ongoing government shutdown is hindering its ability to consider appeals and reimburse organizations. However, the department cancelled the grants five months before the shutdown began. Almost all the cuts were to nonprofits. Solomon, the former DOJ official, says that reveals how the Trump administration is thinking about public safety. \"The kind of old school thinking is that it's only police that can keep communities safe. And what we're seeing out in the field more and more is that community-based organizations work as a complement to law enforcement,\" she says. In fact, after the grants were canceled, DOJ officials  sent a letter  to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley emphasizing that the cuts were mostly to nonprofits, and \"not to states or local jurisdictions that directly serve our communities.\" \"That's flawed rationale because these organizations play a really important role in their communities,\" Solomon says. \"We got hit pretty hard,\" says Everette Penn, co-founder and former director of the Teen and Police Service Academy, a mentoring program in Houston that had to reduce its staff. He says federal grant funding has bolstered the nonprofit world for years. \"It's the government sector that funds things that often are not funded in the private sector because they're necessary to keep our society functioning,\" he says. Dwight Robson, executive vice president of operations at the community violence intervention group Roca, said the DOJ told his organization that its work \"no longer effectuates\" the administration's priorities. Yet Robson says combatting violent crime and protecting children were among the DOJ's new listed priorities in its communications to his organization. \"Those are things we think we do very, very well. We're not of the mind that we're entitled to any funding. We're very happy to undergo any sort of merit-based, individualized review of our performance,\" says Robson. \"We believe that such an examination would result in one concluding that there's actually very good alignment between what the Department of Justice's priorities are and our work.\" Roca had to eliminate about 50 positions, Robson says. They're now looking for other funding streams. He says Roca will get through this challenge, but he worries about the future of other groups dedicated to community safety. \"I'm sure there are funders that are looking at organizations and saying 'Gosh, they're doing good work,'\" he says. \"But it's unclear whether they're going to be there in two or three, four, five years.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604211","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:41:00-05:00","title":"Death by Lightning Unfolds Like an 1880s 'West Wing'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Death by Lightning is a four-part Netflix miniseries set in the 1880s that dramatizes the political rise and assassination of President James Garfield, inspired by the historical events and the book Destiny of the Republic by Candice Millard.

It's full of political intrigue and unexpected betrayals — focusing on an elected representative whose desire is to do right and do good, no matter how many obstacles are in the way.  James Garfield, played by the always intense  Michael Shannon , brings his intensity to Garfield's public oratory. But at home, his Garfield is a gentle, loving husband, father and farmer — an unlikely person to rise to the top in the snake pit of national government in the 1880s.  Equally unlikely to achieve any level of success is Charles Guiteau, another character from humble beginnings. Guiteau, though, is a lot less noble than Garfield, and a lot less humble. In fact, he may be delusional about his own self-worth, and he's not above stealing, lying, forging or other crimes to further his ambitions.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the  Stephen Sondheim  musical  Assassins , Guiteau was portrayed with the enthusiastic optimism of a child, and that's how he's played here by  Matthew Macfadyen , who played Tom on  Succession . It's a wholly committed, completely empathic portrayal. You can feel Guiteau's emotions — his highs and his lows — instantly and deeply, often in the same scene.  When we meet Guiteau for the first time, he's facing a panel and defending his behavior in 1880 after being incarcerated in the New York jail called The Tombs.

Assassins  is an outstanding musical — just as  Death by Lightning  is outstanding television. \n         \n         Transcript \n         TONYA MOSLEY, HOST:   This is FRESH AIR. \"Death By Lightning,\" the new four-part miniseries now streaming on Netflix, stars Michael Shannon from \"Boardwalk Empire\" as President James Garfield and Matthew Macfadyen from \"Succession\" as Charles Guiteau, the man who assassinated him. Our TV critic David Bianculli has this review. DAVID BIANCULLI, BYLINE: \"Death By Lightning\" is a period piece, but it plays like a 19th century version of \"The West Wing.\" It's full of political intrigue and unexpected betrayals, focusing on an elected representative whose desire is to do right and do good no matter how many obstacles are in the way. James Garfield, played by the always intense Michael Shannon, brings his intensity to Garfield's public oratory. But at home, his Garfield is a gentle, loving husband, father and farmer, an unlikely person to rise to the top in the snake pit of national government in the 1880s. Equally unlikely to achieve any level of success is Charles Guiteau, another character from humble beginnings. Guiteau, though, is a lot less noble than Garfield and a lot less humble. In fact, he may be delusional about his own self-worth, and he's not above stealing, lying, forging or other crimes to further his ambitions. In the Stephen Sondheim musical \"Assassins,\" Guiteau was portrayed with the enthusiastic optimism of a child, and that's how he's played here by Matthew Macfadyen, who played Tom on \"Succession.\" It's a wholly committed, completely empathic portrayal. You can feel Guiteau's emotions, his highs and his lows, instantly and deeply, often in the same scene. As in this one, when we meet Guiteau for the first time, facing a panel and defending his behavior in 1880 after being incarcerated in the New York jail called The Tombs. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"DEATH BY LIGHTNING\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) To speak candidly on behalf of the panel, Mr. Guiteau, you seem to us a liar and a fraud. We fail to see how you've served as anything more than a drain on good society. MATTHEW MACFADYEN: (As Charles Guiteau) A drain? A drain on good society. That's - wow. No, that's not right. That's not how this is supposed to go. You know, sir, you sit there and you ask me to prove my worth. Well, let me tell you, I sit now in the same position as any one of our forebears. Are we not a nation built wholly from rogues and migrants and free thinkers? Isn't that the whole point of this thing? Here, and only here, a man can be anyone. He can amass a fortune. He can influence millions through words or action, his name ringing down through the ages. Not a drain. No, not a drain, but a credit. Hell, under the right conditions he might even be made president. BIANCULLI: James Garfield, on the other hand, has no such ambitions. He's a congressman representing Ohio, but spends most of his time back home. He's asked to do a favor for a fellow Ohio politician, to nominate him at the upcoming Republican National Convention in Chicago. Garfield's nominating speech, though, is so inspirational, the deadlocked convention eventually adds his name to the potential nominees. On the 36th ballot, Garfield emerges as the Republican front-runner, a fact that amuses Senator James Blaine, played by Bradley Whitford. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"DEATH BY LIGHTNING\") BRADLEY WHITFORD: (As James Blaine) It's yours, Congressman. MICHAEL SHANNON: (As James Garfield) You didn't ask me if I wanted it. WHITFORD: (As James Blaine) Everyone wants it. BIANCULLI: Bradley Whitford, from the original \"West Wing\" TV series, is featured at the moment in another Netflix political drama as the first gentleman on the new season of \"The Diplomat.\" He has more to do as this four-part miniseries goes on, and so do many of the other supporting players. Two, in particular, are worth spotlighting. Nick Offerman, as Chester Alan Arthur, is cartoonish and bullying when it's called for and sensitive when that's called for. And he's perfect in every scene. And Betty Gilpin as Garfield's wife Lucretia - he calls her Crete - is perfect too. You might wonder why Gilpin, after starring in \"American Primeval\" and \"GLOW,\" is playing such a relatively small role, even one that's so dignified and independent. But her scenes with Shannon as Garfield are lovely, as in this rare moment alone, sitting on their porch after he's returned with his party's presidential nomination. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"DEATH BY LIGHTNING\") SHANNON: (As James Garfield) Sitting here with you on this porch, reading our books in peace, it's my favorite thing. BETTY GILPIN: (As Lucretia Garfield) Then why go to Chicago and stand up and give that damned speech? SHANNON: (As James Garfield) Because nobody was saying what needed to be said, not a one of them. I waited. I waited, I hoped just one other man in that hall would stand up and tell the truth. I swear to God, Crete, if that would have happened, I'd have kept my mouth shut. But now I have to consider the possibility that I might be able to fix all the things that terrify me about this country. I mean, what if you and I could actually make a difference? BIANCULLI: But at another point in \"Death By Lightning,\" Gilpin's character explodes into a whole new gear, altering the course of history along the way. It's a moment that makes it clear why Gilpin took the role. The series is created by Mike Makowsky, based on the book \"Destiny Of The Republic\" by Candice Millard. Among its executive producers are David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who brought \"The Game Of Thrones\" and \"3 Body Problem\" to television. And now they've all brought to TV a dated history lesson that seems not at all dated today. \"Death By Lightning\" is full of recognizable arrogance - political, social, medical - and also contains recognizable strains of both optimism and hopelessness. Those, by the way, all were central themes in the musical \"Assassins,\" which included the actual song Charles Guiteau composed to sing on the gallows just before his execution. The song is performed in part in \"Death By Lightning,\" but I'll close with the Broadway version, sung by Denis O'Hare as Guiteau. \"Assassins\" is an outstanding musical, just as \"Death By Lightning\" is outstanding television. MOSLEY: David Bianculli reviewed the new Netflix miniseries \"Death By Lightning.\" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE BALLAD OF GUITEAU\") DENIS O'HARE: (As Charles Guiteau, singing) I am going to the Lordy. I am so glad. I am going to the Lordy. I am so glad. I have unified my party. I have saved my country. I shall be remembered. I am going to the Lordy. NEIL PATRICK HARRIS: (As the Balladeer, singing) Look on the bright side, not on the sad side.

with or accused of various crimes or conduct related to attempts to subvert the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claimed to have won.   Some faced state prosecutions, while others were never charged. A proclamation  published on Martin's personal X account  late Sunday listed 77 people who received \"full, complete, and unconditional\" pardons, including Rudy Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and Sidney Powell, a former Trump attorney who spread conspiracy theories about ballot fraud after Trump lost the 2020 election.

Mayor Giuliani never sought a pardon but is deeply grateful for President Trump's decision.\" Powell is one of four pardon recipients who previously pleaded guilty in a Georgia court after being indicted for trying to subvert the 2020 election results in Georgia. The pardons are largely symbolic as none of the names listed were ever charged with federal crimes.

A tale of $399 couches and tariffs \n         By Alina Selyukh \n        \n           Friday, November 7, 2025 • 5:01 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         NPR's series  Cost of Living: The Price We Pay  is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out  this form  to share your story with NPR. What's the item? Furniture How has the price changed since before the pandemic? The price of bedroom furniture rose 11% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price of living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rose 25%. Why has the price gone up?  Like all industries, furniture makers and sellers are dealing with higher expenses: utilities, insurance, wages. Big cost spikes came during the pandemic, when shoppers  raced to buy  desks for home offices and patio sets, and  shipping costs soared . But if you ask furniture industry insiders, the first thing they'll reply is that the price of furniture has actually grown slower than overall inflation, which has risen nearly 26% since February 2020.  Then, the experts will note that prices are down from their peak in 2022. And then — like David Koehler did — they'll deliver the popular adage: \"You could buy a $399 sofa in 1984, and you could still buy a $399 sofa today,\" says Koehler, who runs the Delaware chain Johnny Janosik Furniture. Of course, not everyone wants a $399 sofa, but the fact that it still exists makes furniture different from other big-ticket items, like cars or appliances. Overseas competition has kept prices lower  Setting aside high-end woodwork and heirloom craftsmanship, sellers of mass market furniture feel intense pressure to keep prices down. \"The barriers to entry are very, very low, and the furniture business is incredibly fragmented,\" says Bill McLoughlin, editor in chief of Furniture Today, a trade publication. Besides, furniture sellers compete not just with second-hand goods, but with any expensive plans you may have, say, for a trip or home repairs. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And the race for cheapest prices has moved a lot of the industry abroad. \"Manufacturing follows low-cost labor. That has been true for 60 years,\" says McLoughlin. \"Because labor is such a large component of the cost of a product.\" American wages tend to be a lot higher than those overseas, on top of the bigger costs of U.S. environmental standards. So even at domestic furniture-making hubs in Mississippi or  North Carolina , many components — fabrics, handles and electronics, like the power button for your recliner — still ship from abroad, mainly China. Enter: tariffs  During his first term, President Trump's tariffs made it pricier to ship furniture from China, so a lot of manufacturing moved out — though not to America, but to Vietnam. This year, Trump raised tariffs on imports from almost all countries. And he's set  new double-digit tariffs specifically  for kitchen cabinets, vanities and upholstered furniture. The furniture giant Ashley Furniture in June  raised the price  of the majority of its products as a result of tariffs. The Home Furnishings Association, an industry trade group, has warned of cumulative cost increases for both retailers and shoppers. What are people doing about it? As importing furniture becomes pricier, American-made furniture may start looking more attractive in comparison. But seller Koehler worries about how shoppers will react. \"The consumer, when we get feedback, they say, 'We would love to buy American,'\" he says. \"But when they vote with their dollars and see, this item is $500 and that item is $1,200, they say, 'I think I can only afford the $500.' So they end up buying an imported item anyway, just because there is such a difference in price.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many shoppers find themselves in the same spot as Erin Cummins in Connecticut: watching their spending rise on other, more critical costs, such as  health insurance , or  car insurance , or  groceries . \"Every time we're having company over, I look at that furniture and I'm going, 'I really need to replace that,'\" says Cummins, whose threadbare couches have been well-loved by three dogs and three children. \"I have priced it out a bit, but every time I do, I get sticker shock and walk away.\" Cummins says at this point, the cost of new furniture displeases her more than the state of what she already owns, and her couches — still standing, even if covered by a blanket — feel more stable than her budget. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:   If you own some, let's call it well-loved furniture, you can probably relate to Erin Cummins from Connecticut. ERIN CUMMINS: Every time we're having company over, I look at that furniture, and I'm going, I really need to replace that. So I have priced it out a bit, but every time I do, I get sticker shock and walk away. PFEIFFER: NPR has been explaining the forces driving up prices in our series Cost Of Living: The Price We Pay. NPR's Alina Selyukh assembles this piece on furniture. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: For Erin Cummins, the horrors that befell her living room furniture were actually really cute. CUMMINS: They've gone through three dogs and three kids now (laughter), so... SELYUHK: They refers to couches - navy blue, upholstered, now thread-bare - and an ottoman - dark brown, faux leather, now peeling. The dogs were masters of jumping on furniture. CUMMINS: Then we had kids, and it was like, oh, this is worse. So... SELYUHK: Now, every time her mother plans a visit, Cummins runs the search, scanning online stores and, of course, Facebook Marketplace, hoping for just the right price-to-quality ratio. CUMMINS: I'd rather buy something that we like and is well-made than buy a cheap couch that's going to fall apart and I have to replace in two years. SELYUHK: Federal inflation data shows that since before the pandemic, the price of bedroom furniture grew almost 11%. The price of kitchen, dining room and that living room furniture Cummins needs grew 25%. BILL MCLOUGHLIN: Furniture prices are rising because manufacturer costs are rising. SELYUHK: Bill McLoughlin is the editor in chief of Furniture Today, a trade publication. He points to all the usual costs - utilities, insurance, wages. One spike came during the pandemic when shipping costs rose tenfold at one point. MCLOUGHLIN: If you read Furniture Today on a regular basis, you'll notice that we write about a company going out of business almost every week. SELYUHK: Setting aside high-end woodwork and heirloom craftsmanship, sellers of mass-market furniture feel pressure to keep prices down because they are competing not just with your local thrift shop or your family hand-me-downs, but also for the budget you may be saving for a trip or home repairs. And so even though some furniture prices grew 25%, that's actually a little slower than overall inflation. David Koehler, who runs a big Delaware chain Johnny Janosik furniture, delivers a common line in the industry. DAVID KOEHLER: You could buy a $399 sofa in 1984, and you can still buy a $399 sofa today. SELYUHK: Of course not everyone wants this kind of cheap sofa, but the fact that it exists makes furniture different from other big-ticket items like cars or appliances. McLoughlin, from Furniture Today, says one reason is because, say, a really basic couch is much simpler to manufacture - plywood, springs, foam, fabric. There's a ton of competitors in furniture, and often they are overseas. MCLOUGHLIN: Manufacturing follows low-cost labor. That has been true for 60 years because labor is such a large component of the cost of a product. SELYUHK: And American labor is not cheap, plus the higher costs of environmental standards here. So even at domestic furniture-making hubs in Mississippi or North Carolina, many components still ship from abroad, mainly China, like fabrics, handles or electronics - think a power button for your recliner. And this is where we come to President Trump's tariffs. MCLOUGHLIN: The specific purpose of that tariff is to give American furniture manufacturers a competitive advantage. SELYUHK: During his first term, Trump made it pricier to ship furniture from China, so a lot of manufacturing moved out, but not to the U.S. - to Vietnam. This year, Trump raised tariffs on all imports from almost all countries, and he set new tariffs specifically for kitchen cabinets, vanities and upholstered furniture. This will make imported furniture more expensive, and seller Dave Koehler thinks American-made furniture will look more attractive in comparison. But he worries about how shoppers will react. KOEHLER: But the consumer, you know, when we get feedback, they say, oh, yeah, we would love to buy American. We want to buy American. It's important to me. SELYUHK: But he says, when they realize that U.S.-made might cost double... KOEHLER: So they end up buying an imported item, anyway. SELYUHK: Many shoppers find themselves in the same spot as Erin Cummins in Connecticut, watching their spending on other more critical costs, like health insurance or groceries. Cummins says, at this point, the cost of new furniture displeases her more than the state of what she already owns. CUMMINS: Our couches are still standing (laughter), so - and I can throw a blanket over them, and it's working. SELYUHK: For now, her threadbare couches feel more stable than her budget.

The legislative package that appears on track to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history leaves out any clear resolution on the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits that have made private health insurance less costly for millions of Americans . It is unclear when the Senate will hold final votes on the legislation, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he hopes passage would be swift. Still, an end could be days away if any senators object. Meanwhile, the shutdown has caused thousands of flight cancellations and delays as air traffic controllers — unpaid for nearly a month — have stopped showing up, citing the added stress and need to take second jobs. President Donald Trump’s administration returned to the Supreme Court on Monday seeking to keep full payments in the SNAP federal food aid program frozen while the government is shut down, even as some U.S. families struggle to put food on the table without that federal assistance. The Latest: Trump admits he doesn’t know where he’d get the money after proposing $10K bonuses for air traffic controllers Asked where he’d get the money during an interview with Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham, Trump replied, “I don’t know. I’ll get it from someplace. I’ll get it from — I always get the money from someplace. Regardless. It doesn’t matter.” The president earlier Monday proposed $10,000 bonuses for air traffic controllers who stayed on the job and didn’t call out sick during the government shutdown. He earlier tapped research and development funds at the Pentagon to pay service member salaries. Senate blocks bid to extend tax credits for health insurance The Senate has blocked a Democratic effort to extend the expiring tax credits that make health insurance coverage more affordable for millions of Americans. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin led an effort to try and extend current law for one year. It was blocked as part of a party-line vote. “My Republican colleagues are refusing to act to stop health care premiums from doubling for over 20 million Americans,” the senator from Wisconsin said. “I just can’t stand by without a fight.” No Republican spoke against her failed effort, though Senate Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota, has promised a Senate vote later this year on a tax credit extension. New Mexico Legislature approves bill to backfill food assistance when SNAP funding falters A bill allowing New Mexico to use state funding to ensure food assistance for the rest of the year in case of interruptions in SNAP federal food aid has been approved by the state Legislature. The state Senate voted 30-6 on Monday to send a bill to the governor’s office that makes up to $20 million in food assistance available each week should federal SNAP aid fall short of that typical weekly transfer. The initiative provides enough state funding to backfill SNAP aid to New Mexico residents through mid-January when the Legislature meets again. “Even with the discussions happening in Washington, we needed to be here so that those benefits can continue,” said Democratic Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth, of Santa Fe. Democrats in the the legislative majority and some Republicans supported the food assistance bill. Green groups sue to block Trump cuts to clean energy projects in Democratic states Clean energy groups and the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, sued the Trump administration Monday over its cancellation of $7.6 billion in grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. The Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.” The cuts affect battery plants, hydrogen technology, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts. The lawsuit says Vought and other Trump officials took advantage of the government shutdown to chop programs in states where voters back Democrats. The Trump administration did not respond to an email seeking comment. Senate kicks off debate on government funding bill Senators have begun debate on a bill to reopen the government, setting the course for likely passage early Monday night. The leaders of the Senate Appropriations Committee kicked off debate. Republican Sen. Susan Collins said the bill includes backpay and key protections for federal workers. “That will make a huge difference to these federal employees who have worked so hard to serve the people of our nation,” said Collins, chair of the committee. Sen. Patty Murray, the panel’s top Democratic lawmaker, said passage of the bill won’t stop her party’s fight to extend tax credits making health insurance coverage more affordable for millions of Americans. Democrats have been seeking to extend the tax credits as a condition for voting for a funding bill. “I and many of many of us have no intention of letting Republicans off the hook,” Murray said. Shutdown closes Manhattan federal courts on Fridays The government shutdown has finally caught up to one of the nation’s busiest federal courts, leading the chief judge in the Southern District of New York to order courthouses closed to the public on Fridays. Nevertheless, Judge Laura Taylor Swain wrote, proceedings and activities “necessary to fulfill the Court’s constitutional obligations” may still be held. Swain’s order affects two federal district courthouses and a bankruptcy court in Manhattan, along with a federal courthouse in White Plains, north of New York City. Court papers can still be filed on Fridays through the court’s electronic system, she said. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which oversees federal court operations nationwide, said the judicial branch was shifting to limited operations “necessary to perform the Judiciary’s constitutional functions” on Oct. 20 after funding for full operations ran out. The administrative office has said it’s up to individual court districts to decide how they handle cases and staffing during the shutdown. California lawmaker launches campaign to fund scientific research in response to federal cuts The proposal would authorize $23 billion in bonds to help scientists in the state study cancer treatments, the impacts of climate change on people’s health and more after the Trump administration cut billions of dollars for scientific research . State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat representing San Francisco, said the proposal would help California take the lead where the federal government has failed. “We have an entire political movement that seems dedicated to destroying all forms of academic inquiry, including science,” said Wiener, who is running to succeed Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi in Congress. “It’s horrifying and just perplexing on so many levels.” The measure would have to be passed on a two-thirds vote in both houses of the Legislature before it could head to the statewide ballot in November 2026. Trump says Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has ‘lost her way’ Asked about criticism by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene that he’s too focused on foreign policy and should focus more on affordability issues in the U.S., the president turned on his Republican ally. “I don’t know what happened to Marjorie, nice woman,” Trump told reporters. “She’s lost her way, I think.” Trump defended his focus on foreign affairs and the importance of national security, saying that Greene was “catering to the other side” and he was “surprised by her.” Greene made her national reputation in part by defending Trump’s leadership. But as inflation has stayed high, she has encouraged the president to focus more on prices for everyday Americans. Trump says Syrian leader is ‘strong’ and ‘tough’ Trump called Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa after their meeting a “very strong leader” and suggested the U.S. would work to help the country succeed. “He comes from a very tough place,” Trump said, adding that al-Sharaa is a “tough guy” and “I like him.” The president said that al-Sharra has “had a rough past, but he said, “We’ve all had a rough past.” Trump didn’t provide any policy details about the meeting, but he said, “We’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful because that’s part of the Middle East.” Trump says he’ll abide by shutdown deal The president said “I would say so” when asked if he backs an agreement to end the shutdown that is now winding its way through the Senate. “We’re going to be opening up our country very quickly,” Trump said. The emerging agreement includes provisions that reinstates federal workers who had received reductions-in-force notices, which are effectively layoff slips. It also protects against such future actions. Trump said he will abide by those reduction-in-force protections and added: “the deal is very good.” Trump to swear in Gor for India envoy The president abruptly invited in the press pool on Monday afternoon to watch Sergio Gor, his former director of presidential personnel, be sworn in as U.S. ambassador to India. Gor’s “leadership was essential to fulfilling the historic mandate entrusted to us by the American people,” Trump said as he began the event. The president joked that Gor made a couple of mistakes in staffing up the administration, but that those officials were now gone. Trump says without evidence that tariff rollback would cost $2T The president appears to be exaggerating the hit to government finances if the Supreme Court overturns his tariffs tied to the declaration of an economic emergency. “The actual Number we would have to pay back in Tariff Revenue and Investments would be in excess of $2 Trillion Dollars, and that, in itself, would be a National Security catastrophe,” Trump posted on his social media site. It’s not clear how Trump reached that number, but he quoted it after saying that the figures from “Radical Left Lunatics” are too low. What is clear is that the U.S. hasn’t collected anything close to $2 trillion in emergency tariffs. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, cited numbers from Customs and Border Protection to indicate that roughly $90 billion out of the $195 billion collected in import taxes so far could have to be returned. Progressive leader calls for Schumer to step aside as Dem leader A top leader among progressive activists is calling for New York Sen. Chuck Schumer to step aside as Democrats’ Senate leader. Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee said the Senate deal to end the shutdown is a failure of Schumer’s leadership. Schumer publicly opposes the deal but was unable to prevent eight members of his caucus from joining Republicans to end the shutdown. “If this was Schumer’s best, his best clearly isn’t good enough,” Green said Monday in a message to PCCC donors. “The legacy of Chuck Schumer is caving, not winning. The best way to unify the Democratic Party and win big in 2026 is to make clear that the new generation of Democratic senators we elect will NOT be following Chuck Schumer down a losing path.” Schumer aides did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nancy Pelosi’s daughter announces run for California state Senate seat Christine Pelosi — the daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — announced Monday that she would seek the California Senate seat that encompasses San Francisco in 2028. The announcement comes just days after her mother disclosed that she would not seek reelection next year after nearly four decades in Congress. The younger Pelosi’s decision to run for state Senate was something of a surprise, since political observers had long speculated that the attorney and Democratic Party activist could follow her mother to Congress. “We need leaders who advance our San Francisco values and build power for the people,” Christine Pelosi said on her campaign webpage . Her decision to run for state Senate could provide some possible political symmetry in the San Francisco Bay Area. The seat is currently held by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener, who is running to succeed Nancy Pelosi in the House. Senate Democrat questions Trump administration’s $7.5M payment to Equatorial Guinea The Trump administration made a $7.5 million payment to the government of Equatorial Guinea as it seeks to deport people to the West African country and draws closer to its heavily prosecuted leaders , according to the top Democratic senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that “this highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.” Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would “far exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined” to the country. Tariff dividends paid annually would be twice as expensive as tariffs The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Trump’s plan to provide most Americans $2,000 funded from tariffs would cost roughly $600 billion and, if paid annually, would be twice as expensive as tariffs. “Current tariffs have raised about $100 billion so far,“ said Matt Klucher, with CRFB, “and will raise about $300 billion per year in the steady state.” If paid annually, dividends would be twice as expensive as tariffs, he said. Trump has floated the idea of $2,000 checks to all Americans except for “high-income people.” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries says he still supports Schumer The Senate Democratic leader has faced criticism from some progressives after several Senate Democrats sided with Republicans to begin reopening the government. But Jeffries said it was on those Democrats to explain their vote, and that he still supported Schumer as the party’s leader in the Senate. “Leader Schumer and Senate Democrats over the last seven weeks have waged a valiant fight,” said Jeffries. In March, Jeffries declined to say whether he had confidence in Schumer after Schumer helped Republicans pass a funding bill. Jeffries says Democrats will continue fight on health care costs Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries says Democratic senators who voted to advance a government funding bill Sunday are “going to have to explain themselves.” “But the overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats continue to remain in the area fighting to fix our a broken health care system,” Jeffries said. He is speaking to reporters as Congress inches closer to approving a bill that would reopen the federal government after a shutdown that has lasted nearly six weeks. Democrats had been insisting the bill include an extension of enhanced tax credits that makes health insurance coverage more affordable, but they were unsuccessful in including that demand. “As House Democrats, we know we’re on the right side of this fight, the right side of the American people, and we’re not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the health care of the American people,” Jeffries said. See how 8 Democrats explain why they voted with Republicans to end the shutdown Eight Democratic senators faced almost instant blowback from members of their own party as they voted to allow the Senate to move forward on compromise legislation that would reopen the government. Their decision Sunday night was labeled a “betrayal” and “pathetic” by some of the most prominent voices in the Democratic Party. “To my mind, this was a very, very bad vote,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats. The group of defectors includes senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Angus King of Maine. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said Monday that they “decided to put principle over their personal politics.” ▶ Read how they are explaining their votes Republican majority leader asks senators to allow a speedy final vote to reopen government Sen. John Thune is asking both Republican and Democratic colleagues to allow for quick passage of a bill to end the federal shutdown. “I’m hoping that will be hours, not days,” he said. “The American people have suffered for long enough. Let’s not pointlessly drag this bill out.” The Senate voted Sunday night to advance the continuing resolution to fund the government through Jan. 30th. But it takes agreement from all senators to allow for a speedy final vote. Thune told reporters he’s confident that Trump would sign the bill once it reaches his desk. Wisconsin governor says Trump request to take back food money from poor people should be condemned Gov. Tony Evers on Monday wrote to the state’s congressional delegation urging them to pressure the USDA to “stop trying to take food out of the hands” of SNAP recipients. The Democrat reiterated that Wisconsin will not “undo” its distribution of SNAP money as the Trump administration has asked. “This is a shocking and disturbing request—and one that should be condemned by every person, regardless of their political beliefs or party,” Evers wrote to the seven Republicans and three Democrats who represent the state. He called it “deeply troubling” that Republicans have not joined Democrats in calling for full funding. Syria’s president is at the White House for a historic meeting with Trump The meeting will be private and closed to press coverage, the White House said. White House: Senate action on shutdown a ‘positive development’ The White House is calling the emerging agreement to reopen the federal government a “positive development.” “We look forward to seeing it progress,” said a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration’s deliberations. Trump has not indicated whether he would sign the funding measure into law, and the White House official stopped short of saying the president would do so. — By Seung Min Kim Trump asks Supreme Court to keep denying full food payments The Trump administration returned to the Supreme Court on Monday in a push to keep full payments in the SNAP federal food aid program frozen. The request is the latest in a flurry of legal activity over how a program that helps buy groceries for 42 million Americans should proceed during the U.S. government shutdown . Lower courts have ruled that the government must keep full payments flowing, and the Supreme Court asked the administration to respond after an appeals court ruled against it late Sunday. States administering SNAP payments continue to face uncertainty over whether they can — and should — provide full monthly benefits during the ongoing legal battles. ▶ Read more about court action over SNAP benefits Latin American and Caribbean nations meet with US airstrikes in mind Representatives of European, Latin American and Caribbean nations are meeting in Colombia to strengthen ties. A key point of discussion is how to handle U.S. military airstrikes on boats it says are carrying drugs, killing at least 75 people so far. Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who has called the deaths “extrajudicial executions,” said he wants the summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the European Union “to be a beacon of light amidst the barbarity.” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said he would attend even as Brazil hosts the COP30 climate conference , to urge Latin American nations to stand together to prevent conflict. He said last week that he spoke with Trump about Venezuela. “I told Trump that Latin America is a region of peace,” Lula said. What’s in legislation to end government shutdown A legislative package to end the government shutdown appears on track Monday after a handful of Senate Democrats joined with Republicans to break the impasse in what has become a deepening disruption of federal programs and services , the longest in history. What’s in and out of the bipartisan deal drew sharp criticism and leaves few senators fully satisfied.

Three Trump-nominated appellate judges ruled last year that Mississippi’s law allowing ballots that arrive shortly after Election Day to be counted violates federal law . Eighteen states and the District of Columbia accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long as the ballots are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Swing states such as Nevada and states such as Colorado, Oregon and Utah rely heavily on mail voting. An additional 14 states allow the counting of late-arriving ballots from some eligible voters. A ruling is expected in time to govern the counting of ballots in the 2026 midterm congressional elections. Supreme Court rejects appeal to overturn its same-sex marriage ruling The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a call to overturn its landmark decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The justices turned away an appeal from Kim Davis , the former Kentucky court clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the high court’s 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. Davis had been trying to get the court to overturn a lower-court order for her to pay $360,000 in damages and attorney’s fees to a couple denied a marriage license. Her lawyers repeatedly invoked the words of Justice Clarence Thomas, who alone among the nine justices has called for erasing the same-sex marriage ruling. The BBC gets letter from Trump threatening legal action over editing of his speech The BBC reported Monday that Trump has sent a letter threatening legal action over the way a speech he made was edited in a documentary aired by the British broadcaster. Two of the BBC’s most senior executives resigned Sunday over accusations of bias in a documentary’s editing of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, before a crowd of his supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington. The program spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. A BBC statement Monday said “we will review the letter and respond directly in due course.” ▶ Read more about the resignations Trump administration announces latest strike on alleged drug boat Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the latest in a series of strikes on boats accusing of ferrying drugs killed six people two vessels in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The dual strikes on Sunday bring the total number of known attacks to 19 and the death toll to at least 75 people since the Trump administration launched a campaign against drug trafficking in South American waters that many see as a pressure tactic on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. “These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route,” Hegseth posted Monday on social media. China tightens export control of chemicals used to make fentanyl China announced Monday that a license would be required to export 13 chemicals to the United States, Canada and Mexico. The announcement did not mention fentanyl, but at least some of the chemicals on the list can be used in the production of the synthetic opioid. Trump agreed recently to reduce a 20% tariff he had imposed on imports from China to 10% after the Chinese government said it would take more steps to control the flow of what are known as precursor chemicals for fentanyl. The chemicals help fuel the illegal production of the powerful pain reliever that has become a major cause of drug addiction and overdose deaths in the U.S. They can still be exported without a license to other countries besides the three named in the Chinese Commerce Ministry announcement.

2025-11-10T18:48:59+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration made a $7.5 million payment to the government of Equatorial Guinea as it seeks to deport people to the West African country and draws closer to its heavily prosecuted leaders , according to the top Democratic senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that “this highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.” Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would would “far exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined” to the country. The payment, made from a fund for migration and refugee assistance, would be the first government-to-government transfer from that account, which was set up by Congress to respond to humanitarian crises. She questioned whether the payment was a permissible use of the money. The State Department declined to comment on the details of diplomatic communications, but said, “Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State. As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.” Related Stories How Trump’s support for a white minority group in South Africa led to a US boycott of the G20 summit 4 MIN READ The Latest: Senate nearer to a deal to end government shutdown after Democrats break with party 19 MIN READ Trump hosts Syria’s al-Sharaa for a first-of-its-kind meeting at the White House 3 MIN READ As the Trump administration looks to Africa for further deportations, the payment raised questions about how it is enmeshing its deportation agenda with other foreign policy goals, as well as the international leaders it is willing to trust. The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized the “third country” policy as a reckless tactic that violates due process rights and can strand deportees in countries with long histories of human rights violations and corruption. At the same time, the Trump administration has developed ties with the vice president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro “Teddy” Nguema Obiang , who is notorious among world leaders accused of corruption for a lavish lifestyle that has attracted the attention of prosecutors in several countries . The AP has reported that the State Department granted a sanctions waiver to allow him to travel to a high-level U.N. gathering in New York in September and visit other American cities. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau also met with Obiang . Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there. Obiang is the son and presumed successor of Equatorial Guinea’s longtime ruler. He’s accused of decades of corruption and abuse of power. The vice president, who oversees national defense and security, has been under international sanctions for years and faces allegations of siphoning state wealth while most people live in poverty. Despite Equatorial Guinea’s oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Obiang’s father, is Africa’s longest-serving president , holding power since 1979. In 2017, a French court found the younger Obiang guilty of laundering and embezzling millions of euros, handing down a three-year suspended sentence and a 30 million euro fine as well as ordering the confiscation of his luxury Paris properties and car collection worth tens of millions. Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice. U.S. prosecutors also reached a $30 million settlement with Obiang in 2014. He had to surrender assets, including a Malibu mansion, a Ferrari and Michael Jackson memorabilia. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-50eb4ad421911696e742d8c4fb4962fd","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:33:09+00:00","title":"Supreme Court Rejects Request to Overturn Legalization of Same-Sex Marriage","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request from former Kentucky clerk Kim Davis to overturn its 2015 Obergefell v.

ultra-processed foods. But experts struggle to define them \n         By Maria Godoy \n        \n           Monday, November 10, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The American  diet is killing us . On that point, public health experts largely agree. And in recent years, people who want to make Americans healthier — across the ideological spectrum — are targeting ultra-processed foods, which make up the  majority of what Americans eat . Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said these foods are \" poisoning \" Americans and blames them for the chronic disease epidemic. California last month became the first U.S. state to  ban certain ultra-processed foods  from school lunches. And the Trump administration is working on its own  definition of ultra-processed foods  to help guide federal policy — and consumers. One  recent survey  found the majority of U.S. shoppers say they're trying to avoid these foods. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But here's the dilemma: Public health and nutrition experts don't agree on a definition of ultra-processed foods that will actually help make Americans healthier. 'They're not all junk foods' The term ultra-processed food was developed by Brazilian researchers to describe the level of processing foods undergo. They came up with the  NOVA classification system . On one end of the spectrum, there's unprocessed or minimally processed foods — such as an apple or frozen peas. On the other end, there's ultra-processed foods, which are made from manufactured ingredients and contain additives like artificial colors, flavors, emulsifiers and preservatives. Think processed deli meats, packaged cookies and candies, sweetened beverages and frozen ready meals. \"It's about additives and processing methods that aren't used in home cooking,\" says  Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian , head of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University. He says nearly 100 observational studies and three different randomized controlled trials have linked overconsumption of ultra-processed foods to a host of health harms — including an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, obesity,  cardiovascular disease ,  certain cancers  and even  depression. But not all foods that fit the definition of ultra-processed are unhealthy, says  Julia Wolfson , an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       For instance, packaged whole grain breads, plant-based milks and some yogurts are considered ultra-processed, but they can be beneficial for health. One study noted that yogurts were linked to a  lower risk of colorectal cancer , even if they had added sugar. Other studies have found  ultra-processed whole grain breads  are linked to a lower risk of  Type 2 diabetes  and  cardiovascular disease . And some of these foods can save time and money when cooking at home, such as jarred pasta sauce. \"They're not all junk foods,\" Wolfson says, so any health policy or regulation shouldn't treat them all the same. \"I think it's important to identify foods that are of most concern for health, and not just treat all ultra-processed foods with the same broad brush.\" But which foods do you focus on? That's a big point of contention. Should we target the nutrients? On one side of the debate you have people like  Dr. David Ludwig , a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center Boston Children's Hospital. He thinks the focus should be   on the overall nutritional quality of foods, not the processing. He argues that the concept of ultra-processed foods is too imprecise and can stigmatize healthy food while giving unhealthy food a false health halo. For example, he says, a low-sugar packaged cereal with added protein would be considered ultra-processed, but plain cornflakes are considered minimally processed — even if you pour a bunch of sugar on top at home. He says he'd much rather see kids eating the former breakfast. The same thing goes with additives. While some additives, such as emulsifiers, have been linked to disruptions in the gut microbiome, others, such as added dietary fiber, are helpful or benign, Ludwig says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"There are healthful ultra-processed foods and then there are unhealthy ultra-processed foods,\" Ludwig says. If the category is so diverse, \"what's the purpose of the concept in the first place?\" He worries that by targeting this one food category, we could end up with something similar to the  'fat-free' era of the 1980s and '90s . That resulted in a surge of low-fat, high-carb packaged snack foods, which were often loaded with sugar. Instead of focusing on ultra-processed foods,  he says it makes more sense  to target nutrients of concern with decades of evidence of harm. Chief among them are highly processed carbohydrates such as added sugars and refined grains like white rice, he says. The Institute of Food Technologists, which represents food scientists around the globe, has endorsed a similar approach. In comments submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture,  IFT called for a definition  that focuses on the nutritional quality of food — such as whether foods are high in salt, sugar and fat — not on the degree of processing. But can you really ignore the processing? Any definition that ignores the role of processing is missing the big picture, says Mozaffarian of Tufts University. While ultra-processed foods do tend to be high in salt, sugar and refined starches, \"that's not the whole story.\" He says,\"there's something about the processing itself that's important.\" High levels of processing alter the physical and chemical structure of foods in ways that change how our bodies digest them, Mozaffarian says. \"We have now molecularly disassembled and reassembled foods in a way that's never been done before in human history.\" Think cheese puffs, which are pretty unrecognizable from the corn meal they start with. \"When you lose natural, intact structure, you get  very, very rapid digestion  of the food in the stomach and small intestine,\" Mozaffarian says. \"So you get bursts of sugar and highly processed starch in your bloodstream.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Over time, these sugar spikes increase the risk of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, the rapid digestion of food means fewer nutrients reach your lower intestine, where the vast majority of our gut microbes live. So you end up starving your gut microbiome. And that's  not good for health  because gut microbes break down food that your body can't digest and in turn, they produce chemical messengers that influence everything from your   blood sugar levels  to your immune system. And evidence suggests our bodies  absorb more calories  from ultra-processed foods than they do from high-fiber whole foods. Mozaffarian says more research is needed to work out the exact mechanisms linking ultra-processed foods to health harms, but he thinks \"we know enough to start taking action.\" So what's a consumer to do? For now, there's no avoiding the fact that the majority of the foods sold in grocery stores are ultra-processed, says Wolfson of Johns Hopkins. And for many people, these foods are often the more affordable and accessible option. If the Trump administration truly wants to help Americans become healthier again, Wolfson says it also needs to adopt policies that help people afford healthier options. In the meantime, she says there are ways to make smarter choices within the ultra-processed category. For example, when shopping for packaged breads, look for whole grain options. And try to reduce consumption of sugar and artificially sweetened beverages and processed meats, two food categories that are  most strongly linked to health harms . And she says, get in the habit of reading ingredient lists. If it's really long and full of emulsifiers, dyes, and colorings, try to find an alternative product \"with the fewest of those ingredients that you don't know and can't pronounce.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       You might not always find an option that's not ultra-processed but you can \"try to maximize the nutrition and minimize the processed ingredients,\" she says. \"It's a tradeoff.\" Eat as many whole foods as you can. Beans, frozen fruits and vegetables are often more affordable options. Ultimately, though, \"If all the experts are disagreeing right now about exactly what to do, imagine what it's like for the average consumer?\" Mozaffarian says. That's why he  wants to see federal policy  to provide guidance. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5587875","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:04:00-04:00","title":"President Trump Pardons Key Political Figures, Including Giuliani, Meadows, and George Santos, in Major Clemency Move","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump has issued a series of pardons and commutations in late 2024 and early 2025, including former aides Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, former U.S. Rep.

It comes after recent clemency grants from Trump to former U.S. Rep. George Santos and an ex-CEO of a cryptocurrency exchange. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While former President Joe Biden still holds the record of 4,245 clemency actions, Trump's second-term pardons and commutations are notable for their political and personal connections to the president, says Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University. \"There's more of a sense of the insider pardon than we've seen previously,\" Meyler said. In mid-October, Trump  commuted the prison sentence  of Santos, the disgraced New York Republican who  pleaded guilty  to wire fraud and identity theft last year. Days later the president  handed a full and unconditional pardon  to Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Binance has ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, but Trump said in an interview with  60 Minutes  that he  does not know who Zhao is . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. presidents are given broad authority to nullify convictions or sentences for federal crimes without the involvement of Congress or the Supreme Court. The legal principle is a holdover from English law, in which  the king had  what was known as the \"prerogative of mercy\" as early as the seventh century. While Trump has granted clemency to a wide range of people convicted of federal crimes, from nonviolent drug offenders to white-collar criminals, his first term in office was also marked by several notable  pardons of political allies  and grants of clemency to people  whose cases were advocated for by celebrities  or friends. Both of those trends have been amplified during his second term, Meyler said. \"He's much more explicit about making political statements through the use of the pardon power,\" Meyler said of Trump's second-term pardons and commutations. She said that includes granting clemency for people who have supported his political career as well as public statements he's made about why a particular crime shouldn't be punished. Trump's pardons align with his politics … Trump is by no means the first president to show leniency to a political ally. President Bill Clinton  pardoned Mark Rich , a former hedge-fund manager whose ex-wife had donated  hundreds of thousands of dollars  to the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Presidential Library and Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign. And President George W. Bush  commuted the sentence  of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. During his first four years in office,  Trump pardoned  his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, commuted the sentence of his friend and political confidant Roger Stone and pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared. In his second term, Trump \"has taken the same norm-busting approach to pardons as he has in other areas,\" Jeffrey Crouch, a professor of American politics at American University, told NPR via email. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Crouch pointed to Trump's move on inauguration day this year to  pardon some 1,500 defendants  (and commute the sentences of several others) convicted of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, siege on the U.S. Capitol in support of Trump's effort to overturn his electoral loss the previous fall. For comparison, Trump granted a total of 238 acts of clemency in his first term,  according to the Pew Research Center . Crouch said many presidents have waited until the \"lame duck\" period at the end of their terms to issue potentially controversial clemency grants — but not Trump. \"He did not shy away from granting early or controversial pardons and commutations in his first term, either.\" Politics have always been entwined with the U.S. clemency process, but past presidents have often used pardons as a way  to heal political divisions . George Washington pardoned some of those involved in the Whiskey Rebellion, while Jimmy Carter granted a blanket pardon to people who had evaded service  in the Vietnam War . The Trump administration has used clemency to benefit some of its political backers. In May, Trump pardoned  former Virginia Sheriff Scott Jenkins , an ardent Trump supporter who was convicted of taking bribes from local businessmen in exchange for auxiliary deputy badges. The day the pardon was announced, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin  posted on X : \"No MAGA left behind.\" And when Trump pardoned Santos earlier this month, the president  said on social media  that Santos had \"the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" The founders envisioned impeachment as one check on what is otherwise a nearly absolute presidential power, but Trump has  faced virtually no criticism from fellow Republicans  for his pardons and commutations. Past presidents have also taken flak from voters for their clemency decisions. Gerald Ford's approval rating  fell by more than 20 points  after he pardoned Richard Nixon in 1974, and he lost the presidential election two years later to Carter. … and his political frustrations While Santos and Jenkins are both Trump supporters, they also fall into another category of criminal that comes up with some regularity in Trump's clemency choices: public officials of both parties convicted of corruption. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump in February  issued a full pardon  for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, after having commuted Blagojevich's prison sentence during his first term as president. Former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld  received his own pardon  in May following his conviction on federal bribery and attempted extortion charges in 2022. Both men are Democrats. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  said in June  that Trump had pardoned a total of 16 former elected officials convicted of corruption charges. Meyler, the Stanford professor, said Trump, who has characterized  his own recent prosecutions  as politically motivated, may view the cases of political corruption against other politicians as similarly unjust. \"Maybe it's not too much of a stretch to think that Trump feels that he was prosecuted for similar kinds of offenses and then is kind of looking out at the landscape of political figures who have been prosecuted and, you know, potentially identifies with the plight of some of them,\" she said. In an emailed statement to NPR, the White House contrasted Trump's approach to the clemency process with former President Joe Biden's, alluding to criticism from Trump and his allies over Biden's use of an autopen to issue pardons and sign other official documents. (In June, Trump  ordered an investigation  into Biden's use of the autopen.) \"It's not difficult to be more involved in the pardon process when your predecessor was an autopen,\" said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. \"President Trump has exercised his constitutional authority to issue pardons and commutations for a variety of individuals.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Jackson also alluded to the lame-duck pardon Biden granted to his son Hunter, as well as Biden's  commutations of 37 federal death row prisoners . Biden said he made those commutations due to his objections to capital punishment at the federal level — and his worry that Trump would lift the moratorium he put on federal executions. \"And the only pardons anyone should be critical of are from President Autopen, who pardoned and commuted sentences of violent criminals including child killers and mass murderers – and that's not to mention the proactive pardons he 'signed' for his family members like Hunter on his way out the door,\" Jackson added. What is the clemency process under Trump? Getting his ear may help Though it's not the only path to securing a pardon or commutation, the official process for seeking clemency is to submit a formal application to the U.S. pardon attorney. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Martin, the current pardon attorney, was appointed by Trump after the president  withdrew his nomination  to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in the face of Republican opposition. The  Trump administration fired  the former pardon attorney, Liz Oyer, in March after she refused to restore the gun rights of actor and Trump supporter Mel Gibson, who had been convicted of domestic violence. Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas, said it's unclear whether the formal process is currently resulting in clemency grants in any significant numbers. \"Right now we know that there's still a mailbox, and that there are petitions going into that mailbox,\" he said. \"What we don't know is what happens after that.\" Osler said concerns about the clemency application process — or lack thereof — predated Trump's second term. He said Biden also issued pardons to political allies and personal connections he thought Trump may target,  including his son Hunter . \"So those norms were being strained and broken before Trump took office, but he certainly has continued that trend,\" he said. Osler, who runs a clinic where he and his students file petitions for people seeking clemency, said it's raising questions among those seeking clemency about their odds of success by following the traditional path to obtain a pardon or commutation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think people are focusing very much on how upset they are about who's receiving grants,\" he said. \"But we need to focus as well on who's not getting grants — those people who have done a long term in prison, who have rehabilitated themselves, often done incredible things in prison. And they're being ignored in their plea for mercy.\" Trump  appointed Alice Johnson  as his \"pardon czar\" in February. Johnson was pardoned for a nonviolent drug offense by Trump during his first term after her story got the attention and advocacy of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian. Johnson said she was going to \"fight for those who are still incarcerated, who don't have a voice like I have right now.\" She  told Fox News  in May that she'd sent more than 100 clemency petitions to the White House and \"over 46 people really were able to get a second chance in life.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/climate-brazil-trump-disasters-cooperation-cop30-ae09566d32a8a97a954b2cef831de503","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:07:28+00:00","title":"U.S. Absence at COP30 Climate Summit Sparks Debate Over Global Climate Action","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 U.N.

Against that backdrop, activists used an empty chair to drive home the absence from these talks of the United States, the world’s richest nation and second-biggest carbon polluter. World leaders highlighted the devastation wrought on some of the world’s poorest places to show the need to work collectively to fight global warming , which is fueling extreme weather. But any united front will be without the U.S., one of only four nations missing the talks, along with tiny San Marino and strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar. The 195 nations who did come to Belem, a weathered city on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, for the talks known as COP30 were told that only together can they swiftly reduce the emissions from coal, oil and gas that cause climate change. While the activists’ empty chair primarily illustrated the U.S. absence, it was also intended to be a call-out for other nations “to step in and step up,” Danni Taaffe with Climate Action Network International told The Associated Press.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More A clear mandate Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , whose nation is hosting these talks, urged negotiators not to forget that “the climate emergency is an increase of inequality.” “It deepens the perverse logic that defines who is worthy of living and who should die,” Lula said. This year’s talks are not expected to produce an ambitious new deal. Instead, organizers and analysts frame this year’s conference as the “implementation COP.” Countries had a clear mandate: arrive with their updated national plans to fight climate change. On Monday, the United Nations released updated calculations showing that those national pledges promise to reduce projected 2035 global greenhouse gas emissions 12% below 2019 levels. That’s 2 points better than last month, before new pledges rolled in. Attendees on Monday stressed cooperation, with Stiell saying that individual nations simply cannot cut heat-trapping gas emissions fast enough on their own. André Corrêa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, emphasized that negotiators must engage in “mutirão” — a local Indigenous term that refers to a group uniting to complete a task. A united front — without the US Complicating those calls is the absence of the United States, where U.S. President Donald Trump has long denied the existence of climate change. The U.N.'s updated figures Monday depend on a U.S. pledge that came from the Biden administration in December — before Trump returned to the White House and began working to boost fossil fuels and block clean energy like wind and solar. His administration did not send high-level negotiators to Belem, and he began his second term by withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement , the first global pact to fight climate change. The Paris Agreement sought to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the historical average, but many scientists now say it’s unlikely countries will stay below that threshold. The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S. Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States, said the U.S. withdrawal “has really shifted the gravity’’ of the negotiating system. Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said. “It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” he said. Though the U.S. government isn’t showing up, some attendees including former top U.S. negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will help take up the slack.

The BBC said Director-General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness had both decided to leave the corporation. Britain’s publicly funded national broadcaster has been criticized for editing a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, before protesters attacked the Capitol in Washington. Critics said the way the speech was edited for a BBC documentary last year was misleading and cut out a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. A clip of the BBC “Panorama” episode shared by The Daily Telegraph appears to show different parts of Trump’s speech edited into one quote. In the episode, Trump is shown saying: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.” According to video and a transcript from Trump’s comments that day , he said:  “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.

You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.” Nearly an hour later, Trump used the phrase “we fight like hell” toward the end of his speech, but without referencing the Capitol. “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said then. In a letter to staff, Davie said quitting the job after five years “is entirely my decision.” “Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,” Davie said. He said he was “working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.” Turness said the controversy about the Trump documentary “has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC — an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.” “In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down,” she said in a note to staff. “While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.” Trump posted a link to a Daily Telegraph story about the speech-editing on his Truth Social network, thanking the newspaper “for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.” He called that “a terrible thing for Democracy!” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reacted on X, posting a screen grab of an article headlined “Trump goes to war with ‘fake news’ BBC” beside another about Davie’s resignation, with the words “shot” and “chaser.” Pressure on the broadcaster’s top executives has been growing since the right-leaning Telegraph published parts of a dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines. As well as the Trump edit, it criticized the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. The 103-year-old BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters — and criticism from its commercial rivals — because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households with a television. The BBC airs vast reams of entertainment and sports programming across multiple television and radio stations and online platforms — but it’s the BBC’s news output that is most often under scrutiny. The broadcaster is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial, and critics are quick to point out when they think it has failed. It’s frequently a political football, with conservatives seeing a leftist slant in its news output and some liberals accusing it of having a conservative bias. It has also been criticized from all angles over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. In February, the BBC removed a documentary about Gaza from its streaming service after it emerged that the child narrator was the son of an official in the Hamas-led government. Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said the BBC was full of “institutional bias,” and “the new leadership must now deliver genuine reform of the culture of the BBC, top to bottom.” Lisa Nandy, the minister in charge of media in Britain’s center-left Labour government, thanked Davie for his work and said the government would help the BBC secure “its role at the heart of national life for decades to come. “Now more than ever, the need for trusted news and high quality programming is essential to our democratic and cultural life, and our place in the world,” Nandy said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/japan-china-taiwan-emergency-takaichi-0cefc2b4e4f1cda16a4c8bfef033be2d","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:53:09+00:00","title":"Japan and China Clash Over Taiwan Remarks by New Prime Minister","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, sparked a significant diplomatic row with China by stating that a Chinese military action against Taiwan could constitute a 'survival-threatening situation' for Japan, potentially justifying the use of force.

2025-11-10T12:53:09+00:00\n\nTOKYO (AP) — Japan was involved in a war of words with China on Monday after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said a Chinese attack on Taiwan could constitute “a survival-threatening situation” for Japan requiring the use of force. Takaichi, who was elected as the country’s first female prime minister last month, said Friday that Chinese use of force around Taiwan would qualify as “an existential threat”. Her comment sparked sharp criticisms from Beijing over the weekend. “We have no choice but cut off that dirty neck that has been lunged at us without hesitation. Are you ready?” Chinese Consul General Xue Jian said in a message posted on X, which was later deleted. Xue also criticized past remarks made by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other Japanese lawmakers that of “Taiwan emergency is Japan emergency” as “blatant interference of Chinese internal affairs and violation of sovereignty” that require a retraction and apology. On Monday, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said Tokyo had protested to Beijing over Xue’s X message. “While the intent of (Xue’s) post is not entirely clear, we must say the comment ... was extremely inappropriate,” Kihara said. Japan’s Foreign Ministry has since lodged a “strong protest” and demanded the post deleted. Kihara urged China to provide an explanation.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Xue’s post was a personal one “directed at the erroneous and dangerous remarks that attempt to separate Taiwan from China’s territory and advocate military intervention in the Taiwan Strait.” He blamed some Japanese politicians and media for hyping the issue to confuse public perception and divert attention. China has lodged “solemn complaints and protests” with Japan over Takaichi’s remarks, Lin said. “Is Japan attempting to challenge China’s core interests and obstruct the great cause of China’s reunification?” he said. “Where does Japan intend to take China-Japan relations?” China regards Taiwan part of its territory and has not renounced the use of force to bring the self-governing island under its control. The latest diplomatic spat started on Friday when Takaichi was asked in parliament about scenarios that would constitute a threat to Japan. The ultraconservative Takaichi cited the examples of a Chinese naval blockade on Taiwan and any military action to prevent the arrival of U.S. forces. “If it involves the use of warships and military actions, it could by all means become a survival-threatening situation” in which Japan could use force for defense, she said. Her response was seen as deviating from her predecessors’ remarks and triggering a controversy that caused her to backpedal later and pledge that her remarks were within the previous official line. ___ Moritsugu reported from Beijing."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-congress-trump-641e7e2324f261da72395b604d9540e8","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"05:01:34+00:00","title":"Senate Moves to End Government Shutdown Amid Health Care Subsidy Debate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate took a decisive step toward ending a six-week government shutdown by voting 60-40 to advance a bipartisan compromise, with moderate Democrats including Senator Tim Kaine, Dick Durbin, John Fetterman, Catherine Cortez Masto, and Jacky Rosen, along with three former governors — Jeanne Shaheen, Maggie Hassan, and Independent Angus King — voting to move forward. The agreement extends government funding until late January, reverses the Trump administration’s mass firings of federal workers, ensures back pay, and protects against future layoffs. However, it does not guarantee the extension of Affordable Care Act health care subsidies, which has angered many Democrats who view it as a betrayal of working families. The deal drew sharp criticism from House Democrats, including Reps. Greg Casar and Angie Craig, who accused Republicans of capitulation. Meanwhile, the shutdown severely disrupted air travel, with over 2,000 flight cancellations and thousands of delays, and delayed food assistance for millions. The compromise reflects a fragile balance of power between ideological demands and practical governance, with significant implications for public trust, economic stability, and political accountability.","keyTakeAways":["The Senate voted 60-40 to move forward on a bipartisan deal to end the government shutdown, with only five Democratic senators switching positions from opposition to support.","The agreement includes extending government funding until late January, reversing the Trump administration's mass firings of federal workers, and ensuring back pay and protection from future layoffs.","The bipartisan deal is supported by three former governors — Sen.

In a test vote that is the first in a series of required procedural maneuvers, the Senate voted 60-40 to move toward passing compromise legislation to fund the government and hold a later vote on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire Jan. 1. Final passage could be several days away if Democrats object and delay the process. The Senate took the first step to end the government shutdown on Sunday after a group of moderate Democrats agreed to proceed without a guaranteed extension of health care subsidies, angering many in their caucus who say Americans want them to continue the fight. The agreement does not guarantee the health care subsidies will be extended, as Democrats have demanded for almost six weeks. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York voted against moving ahead with the package, along with all but eight of his Democratic colleagues. A group of three former governors — New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine — broke the six-week stalemate on Sunday when they agreed to vote to advance three bipartisan annual spending bills and extend the rest of government funding until late January in exchange for a mid-December vote on extending the health care tax credits.

Returning to the White House on Sunday evening after attending a football game, President Donald Trump did not say whether he endorsed the deal. But he said, “It looks like we’re getting close to the shutdown ending.” Five Democrats switch votes In addition to Shaheen, King and Hassan, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, home to tens of thousands of federal workers, also voted in favor of moving forward on the agreement. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman and Nevada Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen also voted yes. The moderates had expected a larger number of Democrats to vote with them as 10-12 Democratic senators had been part of the negotiations. But in the end, only five Democrats switched their votes — the exact number that Republicans needed. King, Cortez Masto and Fetterman had already been voting to open the government since Oct. 1. The vote was temporarily delayed on Sunday evening as three conservatives who often criticize spending bills, Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, withheld their votes and huddled with Thune at the back of the chamber. They eventually voted yes after speaking to Trump, Lee said.

Schumer votes no After Democrats met for over two hours to discuss the proposal, Schumer said he could not “in good faith” support it. Schumer, who received blowback from his party in March when he voted to keep the government open, said that Democrats have now “sounded the alarm” on health care. “We will not give up the fight,” he said. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with the Democrats, said giving up the fight was a “horrific mistake.” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., agreed, saying that in last week’s elections people voted overwhelmingly Democratic “to urge Democrats to hold firm.” A bipartisan agreement Democrats had voted 14 times not to reopen the government as they demanded the extension of tax credits that make coverage more affordable under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans said they would not negotiate on health care, but GOP leaders have been quietly working with the group of moderates as the contours of an agreement began to emerge. The agreement includes bipartisan bills worked out by the Senate Appropriations Committee to fund parts of government — food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things. All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills. The deal would reinstate federal workers who had received reduction in force, or layoff, notices and reimburse states that spent their own funds to keep federal programs running during the shutdown. It would also protect against future reductions in force through January and guarantee federal workers would be paid once the shutdown is over.

Health care debate ahead It’s unclear whether the two parties would be able to find any common ground on the health care subsidies before a promised December vote in the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he will not commit to bring it up in his chamber. Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19-era tax credits as premiums could skyrocket for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies and argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals. Other Republicans, including Trump, have used the debate to renew their yearslong criticism of the law and called for it to be scrapped or overhauled. Shutdown effects worsen Meanwhile, the consequences of the shutdown have been compounding. U.S. airlines canceled more than 2,000 flights on Sunday for the first time since the shutdown began, and there were more than 7,000 flight delays, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks air travel disruptions. Treasury Secretary Sean Duffy said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that air travel ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday will be “reduced to a trickle” if the government doesn’t reopen.

knocking out power to entire provinces, killing at least eight people and displacing more than 1.4 million others. The typhoon was forecast to head northwest toward Taiwan. Fung-wong lashed the northern Philippines while the country was still dealing with the devastation wrought last week by Typhoon Kalmaegi , which left at least 224 people dead in central provinces on Nov. 4 before pummeling Vietnam, where at least five were killed. Fung-wong slammed ashore in northeastern Aurora province on Sunday night as a super typhoon with sustained winds of up to 185 kph (115 mph) and gusts of up to 230 kph (143 mph). The 1,800-kilometer (1,100-mile)-wide storm weakened as it raked through mountainous northern provinces and agricultural plains overnight before blowing away from the province of La Union into the South China Sea, according to state forecasters. One person drowned in flash floods in the eastern province of Catanduanes, and another died in Catbalogan city in eastern Samar province when her house collapsed on her, officials said.

More than 1.4 million people moved into emergency shelters or the homes of relatives before the typhoon made landfall, and about 318,000 remained in evacuation centers on Monday. Fierce wind and rain flooded at least 132 northern villages, including one where some residents were trapped on their roofs as floodwaters rapidly rose. About 1,000 houses were damaged, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV of the Office of Civil Defense and other officials said, adding that roads blocked by landslides would be cleared as the weather improved on Monday. “While the typhoon has passed, its rains still pose a danger in certain areas” in northern Luzon, including in metropolitan Manila,” Alejandro said. “We’ll undertake today rescue, relief and disaster-response operations.” Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared a state of emergency on Thursday due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected damage from Fung-wong, which was also called Uwan in the Philippines. Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 185 kph (115 mph) or higher are categorized in the Philippines as a super typhoon to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather disturbances. The Philippines has not called for international help following the devastation caused by Kalmaegi, but Teodoro said the United States, the country’s longtime treaty ally, and Japan were ready to provide assistance. Authorities announced that schools and most government offices would be closed on Monday and Tuesday. More than 325 domestic and 61 international flights were canceled over the weekend and into Monday, and more than 6,600 commuters and cargo workers were stranded in ports after the coast guard prohibited ships from venturing into rough seas.

relief\n\nThe United States has issued a new waiver to lift the most serious sanctions against Syria, as interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa  visits Washington .\n\nThe move on Monday coincided with al-Sharaa’s meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, underscoring Damascus’s push to forge strong economic ties with the West after the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIt also highlighted al-Sharaa’s  stunning transformation  from an al-Qaeda leader to the president of Syria, who is cultivating friendly relations with the US.\n\nThe Syrian presidency said al-Sharaa and Trump held talks “focusing on bilateral relations between Syria and the United States, ways to strengthen and develop them, and a number of regional and international issues of common interest”.\n\nFor his part, Trump heaped praise on al-Sharaa after the meeting.\n\n“He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy. I like him,” Trump said of the Syrian president.\n\n“We’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful because that’s part of the Middle East. We have peace now in the Middle East – the first time that anyone can remember that ever happening.”\n\nTrump has been claiming that the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza has brought historic peace to the Middle East. But Israel has been carrying out  deadly attacks  daily across the occupied Palestinian territories and Lebanon.\n\nAl-Sharaa led armed Syrian opposition fighters in December of last year to topple al-Assad and end the country’s civil war, which started as an uprising against the former Syrian president in 2011.\n\nAl-Sharaa became the first Syrian president ever to visit the White House. Trump had met with him in May during a trip to Saudi Arabia, when the US president announced his intention to lift sanctions against Damascus.\n\nThe new sanctions relief on Monday suspends  Caesar Act sanctions , which prohibited US business dealings with the Syrian government and military, for six additional months.\n\nSyria advocates are lobbying the US Congress to permanently repeal the law that enshrined the sanctions.\n\n“Removing US sanctions will support Syria’s efforts to rebuild its economy, provide prosperity for all its citizens, including its ethnic and religious minorities, and combat terrorism,” the US Treasury Department said in a statement.\n\nIt added that Trump is “delivering on his commitment to give Syria ‘a chance at greatness’ and to let them rebuild and thrive by lifting US sanctions and ensuring accountability for harmful actors”.\n\nSeveral media reports in the US and Syria had suggested that Damascus would also join the US-led international military coalition against the armed group ISIL (ISIS).\n\nSuch a move could pave the way for the withdrawal of US troops from the country.\n\nAl-Sharaa, 43, was captured by US forces in Iraq during Washington’s occupation of the country, and he led al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria.\n\nLess than a year ago, the US  designated him  as a “global terrorist” and had a $10m reward for information leading to his arrest.\n\nBut the Syrian president had split  from al-Qaeda  in 2016.\n\nSince ousting al-Assad, al-Sharaa has further reinvented his image, dropping his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Julani, for his birth name and promoting a tolerant and inclusive Syria.\n\nThe  Syrian president addressed  the United Nations General Assembly earlier this year, saying that his country is “reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world”.\n\nUnder his leadership, the US and European countries have slowly welcomed Syria back into the international fold after decades of hostility with the country’s former regime.\n\nStill, al-Sharaa received a muted welcome at the White House on Monday. He entered the White House through a side door and was not greeted by Trump outside.\n\nAnd there was no photo opportunity in front of the press or joint news conference between the two leaders.\n\nAl-Sharaa had met with Congressman  Brian Mast , chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and one of the most staunchly pro-Israel politicians in the country, late on Sunday.\n\n“Last evening, the new Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and I broke bread. We had a long and serious conversation about how to build a future for the people of Syria free of war, ISIS, and extremism,” Mast, who previously wore an Israeli army uniform to Congress and argued that there are no innocent Palestinian civilians, said in a statement.\n\nThe Republican congressman is reported to be sceptical of the push to lift sanctions against Syria.\n\nSince the  fall of al-Assad , Israel has been regularly bombing Syrian military installations and state institutions. The Israeli military has also been advancing in the south of the country, well beyond the occupied Golan Heights.\n\nAl-Sharaa had said early on that Syria would not pose a threat to Israel, and his government has detained senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) members in the country.\n\nBut the proverbial olive branch has not stemmed the Israeli attacks.\n\nAl-Sharaa has said that his country is seeking a security agreement with Israel to secure the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the areas they occupied over the past year.\n\nOn Monday, Trump told reporters he was working with Israel on “getting along with Syria”.\n\n“You can expect some announcements on Syria,” he said when asked about the possibility of an agreement between Syria and Israel.\n\n“We want to see Syria become a country that’s very successful. And I think this leader can do it. I really do. And people said he’s had a rough past. We’ve all had rough pasts.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-opens-in-brazil-with-calls-for-unity-amid-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:01:12+00:00","title":"COP30 opens in Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) has opened in Belem, Brazil, with world leaders emphasizing the need for unity and urgent action to combat climate change.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/britain-bbc-trump-panorama-resignations-5f1351093a493c637124d8ea758260b9","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"18:52:36Z","title":"BBC Resigns Top Executives Over Trump Speech Editing Controversy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC faced a major credibility crisis when it was revealed that it edited a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump in January 2021 to create the impression he urged supporters to 'fight like hell' and march on Capitol Hill.

2025-11-10T18:52:36+00:00\n\nLONDON (AP) — The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning. The century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and “fight like hell.” The BBC chairman apologized Monday for an “error of judgment.” A letter from Trump’s attorney threatened legal action , demanding that the broadcaster “retract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements” and compensate the president for the harm caused. Critics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting. “This is an existential crisis for the BBC,” said Julie Posetti, a journalism professor at City St. George’s University of London. “In capitulating so quickly, it has sent a signal that it’s relatively easy to cow the BBC.” Related Stories Britain’s once-mighty Conservative Party is battling to avoid extinction 5 MIN READ Starmer argues for inclusive patriotism and accuses Farage of trying to divide Britain 4 MIN READ Treasury chief says wars and tariffs are harming the UK’s economic outlook 3 MIN READ That is “incredibly dangerous” in an increasingly polarized environment “where the information ecosystem is incredibly polluted,” she warned. A look at the scandal, past criticism of the BBC and uncertainty about its future: Accusations of institutional bias The furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC. The memo raised concerns over how the BBC’s “Panorama” documentary program edited a speech by Trump. The program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.

The memo also criticized BBC coverage of transgender issues, alleging that the broadcaster’s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda, and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. Longstanding criticism from the right Reacting to the resignations Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a screen grab of an article headlined “Trump goes to war with ‘fake news’ BBC.” Trump himself wrote on social media that BBC journalists were “corrupt” and “dishonest” and “tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.” Critics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage , told a news conference that the BBC “has been institutionally biased for decades” to loud applause from supporters. In recent months, the corporation came under sustained criticism from all sides over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, including its livestreaming of a rap duo’s chants calling for “death to the IDF” (Israel Defense Forces) at this year’s Glastonbury festival. It also had to remove a documentary about Gaza from its streaming service after it emerged that the child narrator was the son of a Hamas official. Charles Moore, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph, alleged that the BBC has a consistent bias, “always from a sort of metropolitan, left position” on trans issues, as well as its coverage of race, Trump, Israel and Gaza. “I’m not, of course, saying that it should be right-wing either,” Moore said. “I’m saying it should take impartiality seriously and put in people capable of running this gigantic and self-satisfied bureaucracy.” Posetti disagreed and said the BBC, like many other news outlets, is under attack from right-wing voices and the Trump administration. She acknowledged the editing mistakes but said it is wrong to call the broadcaster fake news “when patently it is not.” “I’m not suggesting that there weren’t errors made, but I think that those errors needed to be addressed head-on, clearly and transparently and in a very timely manner.” Instead, she said, the resignations will have a “destabilizing effect.” Staff arrive at BBC Broadcasting House in London, Monday Nov. 10, 2025.

In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “ 60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded. Last year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. Taxpayers provide funding The BBC is funded through an annual TV license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households with a television. The corporation is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial and independent. It is not a state broadcaster beholden to the U.K. government. Its model has inspired the CBC in Canada, the ABC in Australia and other publicly funded outlets, Posetti said. Known affectionately — or mockingly — as “Auntie,” the BBC began in the 1920s and changed the history of television when many Britons bought a TV set specifically to watch the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. It still devotes more time and resources than other outlets to events such as the death of the monarch in 2022. Outside the U.K. the BBC World Service operates in over 40 languages and is one of Britain’s most significant cultural exports. Apart from news, it retains a huge global viewership with popular entertainment shows, including “Doctor Who,” “The Traitors” and “Strictly Come Dancing” and their spinoffs. Ahead of the renewal of its charter in the next few years, many critics have questioned whether the license fee model is still viable at a time when viewers are turning to streaming competitors, YouTube and social media. The BBC has lost millions of pounds as more households stopped paying the fee in recent years. “This is the BBC’s last chance,” Farage said. “If the BBC doesn’t now get a grip … then I think what you would see within the next couple of years are many, many millions just refusing, just not wanting to have the license fee.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/all-you-need-to-know-about-al-sharaas-historic-visit-to-the-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:01:28+00:00","title":"Syria’s al-Sharaa on historic visit to US, here’s what you need to know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa made history by becoming the first Syrian head of state to visit the US White House since the country’s independence in 1946, signaling a dramatic shift in diplomatic relations after over five decades of isolation under the Assad regime.

Read on to find out.\n\nFor Syria, it is likely about making moves to finally repeal the Caesar Act, a series of sanctions the US applied to Syria in 2019, during the rule of former President Bashar al-Assad, who was overthrown by a lightning offensive led by al-Sharaa in December last year.\n\nWhile the Trump administration gave an  executive order to lift sanctions  on Syria, the US Congress has to vote to repeal the Caesar Act.\n\nUS sanctions on Syria date as far back as the late 1970s, though more were applied in 2004 and again in 2011.\n\nRepublican Congressman Brian Mast, who has previously  compared Palestinian civilians to Nazis , was reportedly an obstacle to the Caesar Act’s repeal.\n\nHowever, Mast reportedly met with the 43-year-old al-Sharaa in the early hours of Monday morning and had a “positive and constructive” meeting, Syrian journalist Fared al-Mahlool reported on his Instagram account.\n\nRemoving all the sanctions on Syria means the country can return to the global financial system, making investments and business smoother.\n\nIt will also help it rebuild its devastated healthcare system and infrastructure damaged during the 13-year civil war that broke out after Syria’s 2011 revolution and the al-Assad government’s heavy-handed response to it.\n\nAl-Sharaa is reportedly also seeking funds for Syrian reconstruction after the war.\n\nMany neighbourhoods were turned to dust and continue to sit in piles of rubble. The World Bank estimates the battered country needs at least $216bn to rebuild.\n\nFor the US, the trip has a different significance.\n\nWashington has high hopes it will convince Damascus to join its coalition against the armed group ISIL (ISIS).\n\nThe coalition is made up of 89 countries from across the world, and includes over a dozen Arab states.\n\nSyria’s joining the coalition will further signal its regional integration under the new administration led by al-Sharaa.\n\nTrump would also like to expand the Abraham Accords, a group of US-brokered normalisation deals between Israel and Arab states, by  adding Syria .\n\nArab media is reporting that Syria is likely to sign on to the fight against ISIL.\n\nAs al-Sharaa landed in Washington, Syria’s Ministry of Interior announced the launch of a “large-scale security operation”, carrying out 61 raids that targeted ISIL cells across the country.\n\nThe ministry said operations were carried out in Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, Homs and Damascus.\n\nEarlier this month, US envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said al-Sharaa would “hopefully” sign an agreement that would have Syria join the anti-ISIL coalition.\n\nNormalisation, however, may have to wait.\n\nIt’s the first time a Syrian president will visit the White House since the country’s independence from French colonial rule in 1946.\n\nAl-Sharaa and Trump met before in Saudi Arabia, with the latter describing the former as an “attractive, tough guy”.\n\nBut this is the first time al-Sharaa or any other Syrian president will visit the White House, signalling a warming of relations between the two countries after more than five decades of the al-Assad family’s reign.\n\nThe trip comes after al-Sharaa visited United Nations headquarters in New York City in September, his first time visiting the US.\n\nIt has been an improbable development, considering that al-Sharaa fought US forces in Iraq and was then captured and spent 2006-2011 in US prison camps.\n\nThe meeting also comes as the US is reportedly establishing a military presence at the Mezzeh airbase in Damascus.\n\nSome reports say the US will use this presence to work at brokering a peace pact between Israel and Syria, though Syrian officials have denied this.\n\nFor his part, Barrack has spoken regularly about getting Syria and Israel to sign on to a nonaggression agreement."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mosquitoes have been detected in Iceland for the first time, marking a significant ecological shift.

Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/israeli-drone-strike-kills-two-in-gaza-as-ceasefire-violations-mount","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"18:04:54Z","title":"Israeli drone strike kills two in Gaza as ceasefire violations mount","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the aftermath of a ceasefire agreed in October 2025, Israeli drone strikes in southern Gaza have killed at least two people, including a child, while Hamas accuses Israel of systematically violating ceasefire terms through continuous bombardments and home demolitions.

Hamas said Israel had refused to allow at least 600 aid trucks daily, including 50 carrying fuel, despite the agreement.\n\nOn Sunday, only 270 trucks entered Gaza through the Karem Abu Salem (known in Israel as Kerem Shalom) and al-Karara (Kissufuim) crossings.\n\nAccording to Al Jazeera’s reporters, the deliveries included 126 trucks of humanitarian aid, 127 carrying commercial goods, 10 with fuel and seven transporting cooking gas.\n\nWhile aid flow has increased since the ceasefire began, Palestinians across Gaza continue to suffer from extreme shortages of food, medicine, clean water and essential goods.\n\nMany remain homeless, with entire neighbourhoods destroyed by nearly two years of relentless Israeli bombardment.\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) says between 500 and 600 trucks of supplies are needed daily to meet Gaza’s most basic needs. But Israel’s restrictions have left the agency struggling to deliver aid.\n\nJohn Whyte, UNRWA’s senior deputy director for Gaza operations, told Irish news outlet The Journal that Israel has barred the agency’s vehicles from entering altogether.\n\n“They just won’t let anything that’s owned by UNRWA go in,” Whyte said. “They’re requiring us to hand our supplies to other agencies and remove the UNRWA logo before they can cross. It’s creating enormous logistical delays.”\n\nIsrael outlawed UNRWA last year, with the ban taking effect in January, cutting off a critical lifeline for Gaza’s displaced population.\n\nReporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary noted that Palestinians were promised 600 trucks of aid daily as part of the ceasefire. “We’ve been monitoring the situation, and the majority of trucks entering are non-essential commercial ones,” she said. “According to the UN and Reuters, only around 200 trucks of humanitarian aid are entering each day.”\n\nKhoudary added that in northern Gaza, where many displaced families are returning, the UN has reported no direct aid entry for 75 days. “People told us they go to bed hungry. They queue for hours for water and can’t afford meat or eggs,” she said.\n\nAs part of the ceasefire’s body exchange arrangement, Israel on Monday handed over the remains of 15 Palestinians to authorities in Gaza. A medical source told Wafa news agency that the Red Cross transferred the bodies to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.\n\nIt was the 12th such exchange under the deal, bringing the total number of bodies returned to 315. Only 89 have been identified so far due to decomposition and a lack of proper equipment in Gaza. Wafa reported that most of the recovered bodies showed signs of torture.\n\nHamas said it had fulfilled its obligations under the agreement, handing over 20 living captives within 72 hours “despite extremely difficult field conditions”. It said it had retrieved 24 of 28 bodies and shared coordinates for others located in areas under Israeli control.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that al-Kheir Hospital in Khan Younis has resumed operations after months of closure due to Israeli attacks. The WHO said it helped rehabilitate the facility by restoring power, sanitation and water systems, and providing medical equipment.\n\nA new 20-bed nutrition stabilisation centre has also opened in the hospital, bringing the total number of such centres across Gaza to eight. These facilities treat children suffering from severe malnutrition complicated by infections and dehydration, conditions that have become widespread amid the continuing Israeli blockade."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/former-french-president-sarkozy-to-be-released-from-prison","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:39:48+00:00","title":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy released from prison pending appeal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from prison after serving three weeks of a five-year sentence for criminal conspiracy related to efforts to secure campaign funding from Muammar Gaddafi during his 2007 presidential campaign.

while living at home.\n\nIn September, Sarkozy was  found guilty of criminal conspiracy  for his role in efforts to secure funding for his 2007 presidential campaign from the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nHe was acquitted of separate charges of corruption and illegal campaign financing.\n\nSarkozy was  sent to La Sante prison  in Paris on October 21, where, reports said, he was mocked by other inmates.\n\nAppearing via videolink from prison on Monday, Sarkozy described his time behind bars as “very hard” and “exhausting”, insisting he had been the target of political vengeance.\n\n“I had never imagined I would experience prison at 70,” he said. “This ordeal was imposed on me, and I lived through it. It’s hard, very hard. I would even say it’s gruelling.”\n\nDuring a 50-minute hearing, the former president again denied all wrongdoing. “I will never confess to something I didn’t do,” he told the court.\n\n“Truth will prevail. This is a fact that life teaches us,” he wrote on X after returning home.\n\nHe added that he would now focus on his appeal process, and that “the end of the story remains to be written”.\n\nThe court said he did not represent a flight risk and therefore did not have to remain in prison until his appeal.\n\nHe was accompanied in court by his wife, Carla Bruni, and his sons Pierre and Jean. Just after 1:30pm (12:30 GMT), the court’s president declared the application for release admissible and placed Sarkozy under judicial supervision.\n\nUnder the terms of his release, Sarkozy has been barred from contacting Minister of Justice Gerald Darmanin. He will face an appeal trial expected next year.\n\nUnder French law, defendants are generally released pending appeal unless deemed a flight risk or a danger to public order.\n\nProsecutors have accused Sarkozy of promising to help rehabilitate the image of Gaddafi internationally in exchange for campaign funding. Libya was still facing global condemnation at the time for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, an attack on a passenger plane that killed 270 people.\n\nWhile the court ruled that Sarkozy had conspired to secure funds, it did not establish that he had personally received or used them in his 2007 campaign.\n\nThe former head of state remains under formal investigation in a separate case involving alleged witness tampering."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/trump-pardons-giuliani-others-accused-of-trying-to-overturn-2020-defeat","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:05:04+00:00","title":"Trump pardons Giuliani, others accused of trying to overturn 2020 defeat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent development, U.S. President Donald Trump has issued pardons to numerous individuals, including former aides Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, lawyers John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro, and dozens of so-called 'illegitimate electors' who participated in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.

scheme involving Energoatom, the state-run nuclear power company that supplies more than half of the country’s electricity.\n\nThe National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which operates independently of the government, announced the probe on Monday as the country faces another harsh winter under daily Russian  bombardment .\n\nIn a statement posted on social media, NABU said that a “high-level criminal organisation” orchestrated the alleged scheme, led by a businessman and involving a former adviser to the energy minister, Energoatom’s head of security, and four other employees.\n\n“In total, approximately 100 million USD passed through this so-called laundromat,” NABU said, without naming the suspects.\n\n“The minister’s adviser and the director of security at Energoatom took control of all the company’s purchases and created conditions under which all contractors had to pay illegal benefits,” according to NABU chief detective Oleksandr Abakumov.\n\nHe said the group discussed increasing the kickback rate during work on protective structures at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear plant last October.\n\nInvestigators said Energoatom’s contractors were forced to pay bribes of 10 to 15 percent to avoid losing contracts or facing payment delays.\n\n“A strategic enterprise with annual income exceeding 200 billion hryvnias [$4.7bn] was managed not by authorised officials but by individuals with no formal authority,” NABU said.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy, addressing the nation on Monday evening, urged full cooperation with the investigation. “Everyone who has been involved in corruption schemes must receive a clear legal response. There must be criminal verdicts,” he said.\n\nZelenskyy’s comments come just months after he was forced to  reverse plans  to curb the agency’s independence following widespread protests. Eradicating corruption remains a crucial condition for Ukraine’s European Union membership bid, a goal Kyiv views as central to its post-war future.\n\nEnergoatom confirmed on social media that its offices were being searched and said it was cooperating with investigators.\n\nDeputy Minister of Energy of Ukraine Svitlana Grynchuk told reporters she was not yet familiar with the case details, but promised a “transparent process” and accountability for anyone found guilty. “I hope that the transparency of the investigation will reassure our international partners,” she said.\n\nUkraine’s power infrastructure has suffered extensive damage from Russia’s air strikes this autumn, leaving large parts of the country without electricity. Although Moscow has not targeted nuclear reactors directly, Ukrainian authorities say substations linked to them have been repeatedly hit.\n\nNABU released photographs showing stacks of cash, Ukrainian hryvnias, US dollars and euros, stuffed into bags and piled on tables. The agency did not disclose the owners of the seized money.\n\nThe agency conducted 70 searches, reviewed more than 1,000 hours of audio recordings, and deployed its entire detective staff over 15 months.\n\nOpposition lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a strong supporter of anticorruption reform, said he would introduce a parliamentary motion to dismiss Grynchuk and her predecessor, German Galushchenko, now serving as justice minister. Hrynchuk declined to comment on the proposal, while Galushchenko did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs Ukraine continues to battle both corruption and Russia’s war, Kyiv’s ability to convince its international partners of reform may prove as critical to its future as the fighting on the front lines."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/us-claims-it-strikes-two-boats-carrying-narcotics-in-pacific-killing-six","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:28:51+00:00","title":"US claims it hit two boats 'carrying narcotics' in Pacific, killing six","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States conducted two military strikes in international waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean, targeting vessels it claims are carrying narcotics and associated with narco-trafficking.

military strikes  against what it says are drug boats in international waters headed to the country.\n\nPentagon chief Pete Hegseth said on Monday that the US military targeted two vessels in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Sunday, killing six people.\n\n“These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” he wrote in a social media post.\n\n“Both strikes were conducted in international waters, and three male narco-terrorists were aboard each vessel. All six were killed. No US forces were harmed.”\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has faced mounting criticism over such attacks, including accusations of violating domestic and international law.\n\nBut Washington appears to be stepping up the campaign. Sunday’s deadly double attack was the fourth this month.  Previous strikes  in the Pacific and Caribbean Sea killed at least eight people, according to US authorities.\n\nThe Trump administration started targeting boats in the Caribbean in September and later expanded its military push to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe US has carried out 18 strikes on vessels so far, killing dozens of people.\n\nLast month, United Nations rights chief  Volker Turk said  the US attacks have no justification under international law.\n\n“These attacks – and their mounting human cost – are unacceptable,” Turk said. “The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them.”\n\nThe US has described the attacks as “counterterrorism” operations after having designated drug cartels as “terrorists”.\n\n“Under President Trump, we are protecting the homeland and killing these cartel terrorists who wish to harm our country and its people,” Hegseth said on Monday.\n\nOther than grainy footage showing the strikes, the Trump administration has not provided concrete proof that the vessels targeted were carrying drugs.\n\nTrump himself has previously joked that fishermen are now afraid to operate in the Caribbean off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nCritics have questioned why US authorities would not monitor the boats and intercept them when they enter the country’s territorial waters instead of extrajudicially executing the suspects.\n\nThe strikes have sparked regional tensions, particularly with Venezuela, with Trump accusing its president, Nicolas Maduro, of links to “narcoterrorists”.\n\nThe ramped-up US military campaign near Venezuela has raised speculation that Washington may be preparing for conflict in the oil-rich South American country.\n\nThis month, Trump suggested that  war with Venezuela  is unlikely but said Maduro’s days are numbered."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/iraq-parliamentary-elections-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:49:52+00:00","title":"Iraq parliamentary elections: What we know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iraq is holding parliamentary elections on Tuesday, 10 November 2025, with 329 seats up for grabs, including at least 83 reserved for women.

2025-11-10T17:49:52+00:00\n\nTitle: Iraq parliamentary elections: What we know\n\nOn Tuesday, Iraqis from across the country will head to the polls to elect a new parliament.\n\nAnalysts and observers believe the voter turnout will indicate whether Iraqis have any confidence left in the current political system to provide security and improve basic services.\n\nBoth issues have plagued Iraqis since the United States invaded in 2003 to topple then-President Saddam Hussein, an invasion that ruptured Iraq’s social fabric and prompted a rebellion against the US occupation.\n\nWhat’s more, the occupation triggered fighting between Shia and Sunni militias from 2006 to 2008 and between Iraqi government forces and ISIL (ISIS) from 2013 to 2017.\n\nSince the first elected government in 2005, Iraqis have grown disillusioned with their governments’ failure to improve the lives of citizens and the predominance of unchanging faces heading militarised parties. Yet many will still head to the polls.\n\nHere’s all you need to know about the parliamentary elections:\n\nWell, voters will select 329 members of parliament.\n\nOf this number, at least 25 percent – 83 seats – will go to women.\n\nEarly voting for  Iraq’s security personnel and its 26,000 displaced people  took place on Sunday.\n\nFor the rest of the population, polls will open at 7am (04:00 GMT) on Tuesday and close at 6pm (15:00 GMT).\n\nThey will cast their ballots at polling stations across 18 of Iraq’s 19 provinces. The recently created province of Halabja will be included with Sulaimaniya in the vote.\n\nThere are 7,744 candidates running, most affiliated with sectarian political parties and blocs – a direct outcome of the  “muhasasa” (quota) system  ushered in after the US invasion.\n\nMuhasasa was an attempt to bring about proportional representation among Iraq’s diverse ethnic and religious communities.\n\nAccording to the system, the speaker of parliament will always be a Sunni, the prime minister a Shia and the president a Kurd.\n\nThis election will see a powerful Shia bloc headed by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki run in the elections as well as a coalition headed by the current leader, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.\n\nThe latter is aiming to secure a second term as prime minister, yet analysts believe his chances are slim due to deep divisions within the Shia Coordination Framework (SCF), which is the principal Shia political bloc.\n\nThe SCF was formed in 2021 and appointed al-Sudani as prime minister in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the main Sunni political force running in the elections is the Taqaddum (Progress) Party, headed by parliamentary Speaker Mohamed al-Halbousi. His party’s supporters mainly hail from Sunni heartlands in the west and north of the country.\n\nThe major Kurdish parties competing in the elections are the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which is trying to secure larger shares of oil reserves to boost the budget in the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.\n\nThe rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which favours closer relations with the government in Baghdad, will also be competing for seats and influence.\n\nPowerful Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has urged his followers  to boycott the elections.\n\nAl-Sadr commands a large following in southern and central Iraq, which he can easily mobilise onto the streets, according to analysts.\n\nAl Jazeera previously reported that al-Sadr boycotted the elections to protest the muhasasa system, which he reportedly wants to replace with a government formed by the blocs that win a majority in elections.\n\nCritics fear that abandoning proportional representation along sectarian lines could eventually pave the way for a new dictatorship.\n\nNevertheless, the refusal of Sadrists to participate in the elections could damage the legitimacy of the next government, Tamer Badawi, an Iraq expert with the Royal United Services Institute, told the Atlantic Council.\n\nHe added that any crisis of confidence in the next government could hurt its ability to provide adequate services.\n\nProbably not as many as in previous elections.\n\nOnly 21.4 million out of a total of 32 million eligible voters have signed up from 19 provinces to partake in the elections, down from four years ago when 24 million people registered.\n\nMany observers and analysts believe voter turnout on Tuesday could dip below 2021’s 41 percent, the lowest turnout on record.\n\nThe lack of participation in Iraq’s elections has been attributed to growing disenfranchisement among Iraqi youth over the muhasasa system, which many perceive as enabling corruption and injustice.\n\nAl-Sudani is pursuing a second term as prime minister, and his bloc is positioned to win the most seats, yet he may still fail at securing the backing of major Shia parties to retain his post.\n\nAl-Sudani’s first term saw him under increasing US pressure to crack down on the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), or Hashd al-Shaabi, a quasi-state paramilitary group that fought and defeated ISIL in 2017 and that the US views as aligned with Iran, which has been influential in Iraq since the US invasion.\n\nAl-Sudani has promised to integrate PMF units into the government and fully submit them to the chain of command of the Iraqi army and other conventional security forces.\n\nThis has been an increasingly delicate task since PMF groups have accrued their own power by entrenching themselves in the economy and creating political parties prominent in the SCF, power that could enable them to win significant seats and compete for major posts in the next government.\n\nYet according to the  Atlantic Council,  the larger player in the SCF is al-Maliki, who harbours ambitions to become prime minister for the third time despite being widely blamed during his two consecutive terms (2006-2014) for exacerbating sectarian grievances, which led to the rise of ISIL."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-summit-in-brazil-what-to-know-about-the-un-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:36:51+00:00","title":"COP30 summit in Brazil: What we know about the UN climate conference","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 30th United Nations climate summit (COP30) begins in Belem, Brazil, with over 50,000 delegates from 190 countries gathering to focus on the implementation of past climate commitments rather than setting new goals.

(COP30) begins on Monday in the Brazilian city of Belem. About 50,000 people from more than 190 countries, including diplomats and climate experts, are expected to attend the 11-day meeting in the Amazon.\n\nDelegates are expected to discuss the climate crisis and its devastating impacts, including the rising frequency of extreme weather.\n\nThe hosts have a packed agenda with 145 meetings planned to discuss the green fuel transition and global warming as well as the failure to implement past promises.\n\nAndre Correa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, emphasised that negotiators engage in “mutirao”, a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.\n\n“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators on Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”\n\nCOP is the abbreviation for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, which refers to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a treaty adopted in 1992 that formally acknowledged climate change as a global threat.\n\nThe treaty also enshrined the principle of “common but differentiated responsibility”, meaning that rich countries responsible for the bulk of carbon dioxide emissions should bear the greatest responsibility for solving the problem.\n\nThe UNFCCC formally went into force in 1994 and has become the basis for international deals, such as the 2015  Paris Climate Agreement , designed to limit global temperature increases to about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 to avoid the most catastrophic effects of global warming.\n\nThe first COP summit was held in the German capital, Berlin, in 1995. The rotating presidency, now held by Brazil, sets the agenda and hosts the two-week summit, drawing global attention to climate change while trying to corral member states to agree to new climate measures.\n\nBrazil wants to gather pledges of $25bn and attract a further $100bn from the global financial markets for a Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), which would provide financing for biodiversity conservation, including reducing deforestation.\n\nBrazil has also asked countries to work on realising past promises, such as COP28’s pledge to phase out fossil fuel use. Indeed, the Brazilian government’s overarching goal for this COP is “implementation” rather than setting new goals.\n\n“Our role at COP30 is to create a roadmap for the next decade to accelerate implementation,” Ana Tonix, the chief executive of COP30, was quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper.\n\nAt a summit last week before COP30, Brazilian President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva said: “I am convinced that despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need roadmaps to reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilise the resources necessary for these objectives.”\n\nIn a letter to negotiators released late on Sunday, Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already – from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, super typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines to a tornado ripping through southern Brazil.”\n\nNot only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives”, Stiell wrote.\n\nCOP30 is also the first to acknowledge the failure to so far prevent global warming.\n\nMore than 50,000 people have registered to attend this year’s COP in Belem, including journalists, climate scientists, Indigenous leaders and representatives from 195 countries.\n\nSome of the more prominent official group voices will include the Alliance of Small Island States, the G77 bloc of developing countries and the BASIC Group, consisting of Brazil, South Africa, India and China.\n\nIn September, United States President Donald Trump told the UN General Assembly that climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, based on “predictions … made by stupid people”.\n\nTrump’s aggressive approach to deny the climate crisis has further complicated the agenda at the conference, which will have no representation from Washington. Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement twice – once during his first term, which was overturned by former President Joe Biden, and a second time on January 20, 2025, the day his second term began. He cited the economic burden of climate initiatives on the US. Trump has called climate change a “hoax”.\n\nThe US historically has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. On an annual basis, however, the biggest carbon polluter now is China.\n\nCOP30 organisers have been criticised for the exorbitant prices of hotel rooms in Belem, which has just 18,000 hotel beds. Brazil’s government has stepped in, offering free cabins on cruise ships to poorer nations in a last-minute bid to ensure they can attend.\n\nAs of November 1, only 149 countries had confirmed lodging. The Brazilian government said 37 were still negotiating. Meanwhile, business leaders have decamped to host their own events in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBrazil has also been slammed for clearing forest to build a new road to reach the conference venue.\n\nRenewables, led by solar and wind, accounted for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added worldwide last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Solar energy has now become the cheapest form of electricity in history.\n\nMeanwhile, one in five of new cars sold around the world last year was electric, and there are now more jobs in clean energy than in fossil fuels, according to the UN.\n\nElsewhere, the International Energy Agency has estimated that global clean-energy investment will reach $2.2 trillion this year, which would be about twice as much as on fossil fuel spending.\n\nAt the same time, global temperatures are not just rising, they are climbing faster than ever with new records logged for 2023 and 2024. That finding was part of a study done every few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe new research shows the average global temperature rising at a rate of 0.27C (0.49F) each decade, almost 50 percent faster than in the 1990s and 2000s when the warming rate was around 0.2C (0.36F) per decade.\n\nThe world is now on track to cross the 1.5C threshold by 2030, after which scientists warn that humanity will trigger irreversible climate impacts. Already, the planet has warmed by 1.3C (2.34F) since the pre-industrial era, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nAt the same time, governments around the world spend about $1 trillion each year subsidising fossil fuels.\n\nAt a preparatory summit with dozens of heads of state and government, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The hard truth is that we have failed to ensure we remain below 1.5 degrees.”\n\n“Science now tells us that a temporary overshoot beyond the 1.5 limit – starting at the latest in the early 2030s – is inevitable. We need a paradigm shift to limit this overshoot’s magnitude and duration and quickly drive it down,” he said on Thursday.\n\n“Even a temporary overshoot will have dramatic consequences. It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unliveable conditions and amplify threats to peace and security.”\n\nThe India-Pakistan  heatwave  began unusually early, in April this year. By June, temperatures had reached a peak of about 48C (118.4F) in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Hundreds of lives were lost, and crops were decimated.\n\nEurope also faced extreme heat this year. Over the summer, the region endured a heatwave that pushed cities like Lisbon past 46C  (114.8F). In London, a prolonged period of elevated temperatures in late June caused an estimated excess 260 deaths.\n\nAt the same time,  Mediterranean wildfires  ravaged large tracts of Southern Europe with more than 100,000 people evacuated and dozens of deaths.\n\nTurkiye suffered one of its worst droughts in decades, hitting agricultural areas. Rainfall dropped by up to 71 percent in some areas compared with the previous year, stressing ecosystems and energy and food production."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/millions-endure-power-cuts-in-ukraine-as-russia-strikes-more-energy-sites","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:21:29+00:00","title":"Millions endure power cuts in Ukraine as Russia strikes more energy sites","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Millions of Ukrainians are enduring widespread power outages as Russia conducts a new wave of drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, including high-voltage transmission lines in regions such as Poltava, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, and Kyiv.

fragile US-backed  ceasefire in Gaza .\n\nKushner, the son-in-law of US President Donald Trump who helped broker the agreement, met Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday as part of US efforts to stabilise the tenuous truce.\n\nThe meeting comes a month after Washington and regional powers pushed Israel to agree to a ceasefire. The truce has partly halted two years of Israeli bombardment, which levelled much of Gaza and killed more than 69,000 people, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\nThe talks focused on some of the most contentious elements of Trump’s 20-point plan to end Israel’s two-year war on the Palestinian territory, according to Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian.\n\nThe officials discussed plans for the disarmament of Hamas, the deployment of international security forces and the establishment of a technocratic government in the territory that excludes Hamas, she said.\n\nHamas has repeatedly insisted that relinquishing its weapons is a red line.\n\nAddressing Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, Netanyahu promised that Gaza would be “demilitarised, either the easy way or the hard way”, in what was a thinly veiled threat to escalate the war.\n\nA key point of contention remains a group of roughly 200 Hamas fighters trapped in tunnels beneath Rafah, an area still controlled by Israeli forces. Hamas has demanded their safe passage to Gaza’s interior, but Israel has refused.\n\nThe US’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, described the proposal to grant the fighters safe passage in exchange for disarmament as “a test case” for the broader peace plan.\n\nA Hamas official confirmed that negotiations over the issue were ongoing, saying the group was eager to resolve the dispute “to remove any pretext Israel could use to undermine the ceasefire agreement”.\n\nHowever, he ruled out surrendering the fighters. Another Palestinian source speaking to Reuters warned that any Israeli attempt to forcibly extract them could risk the entire truce.\n\nBeyond the immediate crisis, the ceasefire also requires agreement on a transitional governing council for Gaza excluding Hamas, the formation of the proposed stabilisation force, and conditions for reconstruction and disarmament. Each of these steps is expected to face resistance from both Hamas and Israel, given the political and security implications.\n\nThe proposed international force could require a United Nations mandate before deployment, and few nations have expressed willingness to participate without one. Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye are among the potential contributors.\n\nHowever, the United Arab Emirates has signalled hesitation. “Under such circumstances, the UAE will probably not participate in such a force,” Emirati presidential adviser Anwar Gargash said at the Abu Dhabi Strategic Debate Forum."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched its first national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025 to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14, aiming to prevent cervical cancer, which kills eight women daily.

2025-10-23T08:09:33+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/who-was-soeharto-the-late-strongman-named-indonesias-national","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:38:39+00:00","title":"Who was Soeharto, the late leader named Indonesia’s ‘national hero’?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Indonesia has posthumously named former president Muhammad Soeharto, who ruled for 32 years, a 'national hero' during a ceremony presided over by President Prabowo Subianto, a former military general and Soeharto’s son-in-law.

Muhammad Soeharto , whose three-decade rule was marred by accusations of mass human rights violations, was posthumously named a “national hero” on Monday, causing backlash.\n\nThe title was conferred in a ceremony presided over by President  Prabowo Subianto , a former military general and Soeharto’s former son-in-law, despite protests by pro-democracy activists and the families of those affected by the former leader’s iron-fisted rule.\n\nBacked by the United States during the Cold War, Soeharto used the military to dominate civilian affairs and crush dissent.\n\nHe was also accused of massive corruption and nepotism benefiting his family and cronies, although no charge was proven and he never went on trial due to his failing health.\n\nSo who was Soeharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years? And what’s behind President Prabowo’s decision to honour the late general?\n\nSoeharto, whose name is also spelled Suharto, was Indonesia’s second president. He was a military officer who became president in 1967 after seizing power from the country’s first president and independence leader, Sukarno.\n\nHe launched a brutal  crackdown to purge alleged communists , killing more than half a million Indonesians. The crackdown came after Soeharto accused the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) of a coup attempt following the kidnapping and killing of six military officers in 1965.\n\nIt has never been officially investigated. Soeharto was the key military officer during that time, although his involvement was never proven.\n\nUnder his leadership, Indonesia invaded and occupied East Timor in 1975, killing hundreds of thousands of people. Soeharto had the support of the West, particularly Washington, for his brutal actions in Indonesia and East Timor.\n\nThe former leader and his family were also suspected of corrupt practices during his rule. The charges remain unproven. Attempts to try Soeharto for graft were first made in 2000, but he failed to appear in court and was later declared too ill to stand trial.\n\nSoeharto’s three-decade rule was marked by rapid economic growth and political stability, but also involved severe restrictions on human rights and free speech, and the military’s violent crackdowns on the opposition.\n\nHe was forced out of office in 1998 following deadly student protests in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. He issued an apology to the nation after his ouster, but did not specifically mention the human rights abuses and corruption that characterised his rule.\n\nSoeharto came from a humble background. He joined the Dutch colonial army at 19 as a corporal and afterwards fought with Indonesian guerrillas against the Dutch colonial forces. Indonesia gained independence from the Netherlands in 1945.\n\nSoeharto  was one of the 10 people recognised by Prabowo during a televised ceremony that took place at the presidential palace in Jakarta to commemorate the annual National Hero Day.\n\nEvery year, the title of national hero is awarded to Indonesians who have contributed significantly to the Southeast Asian archipelago’s development.\n\n“A prominent figure from Central Java province, a hero of the struggle for independence, General Soeharto stood out since the independence era,” an announcer said as Prabowo handed the award to Soeharto’s daughter and son.\n\nSoeharto joins a list of more than 200 people that includes the first democratically elected president, Sukarno, as well as prominent women’s rights advocates, Islamic scholars and independence activists.\n\nFormer President Abdurrahman Wahid and labour activist Marsinah, who was kidnapped and murdered under Soeharto, are also among this year’s candidates to become national heroes.\n\nSoeharto’s daughter, Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, and son, Bambang Trihatmodjo, were among the attendees at Monday’s ceremony.\n\n“Please remember what my father had done, from when he was young, until he was old, all his fights for this country and the Indonesian people,” Siti told reporters after the ceremony.\n\nYes.\n\nAhead of the National Hero Day ceremony, activists and civil society members rallied outside the presidential palace to protest proposals to grant Soeharto the national hero title. They raised an alarm about historical revisionism in Indonesia.\n\nSome carried posters saying: “Stop the Whitewashing of the General of Butchery” and “Thousands Died But The Country Chose to Forget”.\n\nThe Commission for the Disappeared and Victims of Violence (KontraS), a local rights group, said designating Soeharto a national hero was immoral and helped to normalise impunity.\n\n“[Soeharto], as someone suspected of being involved in human rights violations, state violence and various offences related to human rights abuses, does not deserve to be awarded the title of national hero,” KontraS coordinator Dimas Bagus Arya told AFP.\n\nLast week, around 500 civil society members, activists and academics published a letter sent to Prabowo requesting he not proceed with the hero designation.\n\nThe letter said awarding Soeharto the title was a betrayal of his victims and of democratic values, and constituted a dangerous distortion of history.\n\nSeveral rights groups also sent a letter to Culture Minister Fadli Zon and Prabowo to oppose the plan to honour the former leader. Fadli said proposing national hero candidates included public input.\n\n“We have conducted research,” he told reporters. “All of them have met the requirements.”\n\nState Secretary Prasetyo Hadi also defended the government’s decision.\n\n“It is part of how we honour our predecessors, especially our leaders, who undoubtedly have made extraordinary contributions to the nation and the country,” he told reporters.\n\nPrabowo is closely associated with Soeharto and was an ally of the former president. Prabowo is a former army general who served as the special forces commander during Soeharto’s rule.\n\nThe current Indonesian president was married to Soeharto’s daughter Siti Hediati Hariyadi. The couple divorced after 15 years of marriage, and she is now a parliamentarian.\n\nPrabowo has been accused of being involved in military crimes in East Timor under Soeharto in 1983. East Timor only became independent after Soeharto stepped down.\n\nSoeharto’s party, Golkar, remains a major player in Indonesian politics and backs Prabowo. Golkar holds key ministries in the Indonesian cabinet.\n\nPrabowo rose to power following an election last year, and has been accused by his critics of expanding the role of the military in civilian domains.\n\nIn response to outcry over the plan to include Soeharto, Prabowo’s office had insisted he has the right to bestow the title upon whomever he chooses.\n\nYes.\n\nSoeharto was a staunch anti-communist, and the US played a role in shoring him up.\n\nEven before Soeharto rose to power, the US sought to weaken and depose Sukarno, who was accused of being sympathetic to communists.\n\nIn 2017, diplomatic cables declassified by the US National Security Archive and the National Declassification Center showed that Washington had intimate knowledge about the 1965 purge of alleged communists in Indonesia."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09+00:00","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, located 11 billion light years away in a distant galaxy.

hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/9/powerful-tornado-wrecks-brazil-town-killing-six-and-injuring-hundreds","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"04:22:10+00:00","title":"Powerful tornado wrecks Brazil town, killing six and injuring hundreds","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful tornado with winds reaching up to 250km/h struck Rio Bonito do Iguacu, a town in southern Brazil's Paraná state, late on Friday, November 8, 2025, destroying approximately 90% of the town and killing at least six people, with 750 injured.

2025-11-07T22:44:26+00:00\n\nTitle: James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97\n\nScientist James Watson, whose research on the structure of DNA helped pave the way for developments in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n\nIn a statement announcing his death, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Watson previously worked, called the discovery a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article addresses the controversy surrounding claims by former President Donald Trump that the U.S. should resume nuclear weapon testing in response to China’s nuclear expansion.

explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"7112-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, highlighting breakthroughs in genetics and AI, environmental interventions like cloud seeding in Delhi, geopolitical tensions affecting supply chains such as China's ban on Nexperia products, and public health advances like Pakistan’s HPV vaccine rollout.

Senate shutdown vote: What happened, who voted to end it, what’s next?\n\nThe United States Senate has taken its  first step  towards ending the longest government shutdown in the country’s history as lawmakers agreed to move forward with a stopgap funding package.\n\nThe Republican-led proposal, which would keep the government running until January 30, comes after weekend negotiations between the Republicans and Democrats to end the shutdown, which on Monday entered its  41st day .\n\nThe shutdown, which has surpassed the 35-day record in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term, has disrupted flights across the country, deprived millions of Americans of food aid and left more than 1.3 million federal government employees furloughed or working without pay.\n\nThe Senate passed a procedural vote on Sunday, which means the vote was not over the bill, but it will allow the bill to move forward so senators can debate and eventually vote on it. This 60-40 test vote marks the first step in a series of procedural manoeuvres.\n\n“Now, this is what is called a cloture vote, a procedure by which the Senate agrees to continue the debate about the legislation and begins introducing and passing the bills aimed at ending the shutdown,” Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna said, reporting from Washington, DC.\n\nIf the Senate eventually passes the bill, the package still must be approved by the House of Representatives before being sent to Trump for his signature to become law.\n\nIn the Senate, Republicans hold 53 seats and Democrats have 47, but Republicans do not have the 60 votes needed to advance bills. Eight senators who caucus with the Democrats voted to move the Republican measure forward.\n\nIn the House, Republicans hold 220 seats while Democrats have 212.\n\nThe measure would provide yearlong funding for certain parts of the government, including for food assistance programmes and the legislative branch.\n\nIt does not extend health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which Democrats have been demanding to pass any funding measure. The ACA was passed in 2010 under President Barack Obama and expanded health insurance coverage.\n\nHowever, centrist Democrats and Republicans reached a deal to vote in December on extending the healthcare tax credits, which are due to expire this year. The subsidies under the ACA help low-income Americans pay for private insurance.\n\nDemocrats have been promised that the Trump administration will continue to employ government employees furloughed due to the shutdown and extend the expiring healthcare tax credits, according to the US-based news site Politico.\n\nBut no official information about the bill has been available so far.\n\nIn a statement before the vote, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, the Republican leader of the chamber, lauded the “bipartisan way” to address the crisis.\n\nBut Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, expressed concerns. “For months and months, Democrats have been fighting to get the Senate to address the healthcare crisis. This bill does nothing to ensure that that crisis is addressed,” he said.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump proposed to send ACA subsidies directly into people’s bank accounts, building pressure on the Democrats.\n\n“I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,” he posted on his Truth Social platform.\n\nIn July, Trump and Congress  cut Medicaid  funding by $930bn over the next decade as part of his “Big Beautiful Bill”. Medicaid is the biggest government-run health programme and provides care to low-income people.\n\nThe measure passed in a 60-40 vote. Eight members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate voted for the bill. All Republicans voted for the measure except Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky.\n\nDemocratic senators who voted for the motion to advance the bill included Dick Durbin of Illinois; Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire; John Fetterman of Pennsylvania; Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada; and Tim Kaine of Virginia.\n\nIndependent Senator Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, also voted in favour of the measure.\n\nYes.\n\nSchumer said before the vote that he could not support the measure “in good faith”. The Senate minority leader, who faced criticism from fellow Democrats in March for voting with Republicans to keep the government open, said the party has now “sounded the alarm” on healthcare.\n\n“We will not give up the fight,” Schumer said.\n\nBernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, said that giving up the fight would be a “horrific mistake”.\n\nDemocratic Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said local and state elections last week saw support for Democratic candidates because voters were expecting Democrats to hold firm in the negotiations.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani won the  New York mayoral election . Democrats also won gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia on the same day.\n\nSince the beginning of the shutdown, Democratic senators voted 14 times not to reopen the government as they demanded the extension of the ACA tax credits.\n\nThe shutdown has resulted in about 750,000 federal employees being furloughed, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). A furloughed employee is suspended or discharged for a period of time without pay.\n\nThis would result in a daily loss of about $400m in wages, the CBO said. Based on this number, the shutdown has resulted in an estimated loss of $16bn in pay over 40 days.\n\nScott Lucas, a professor of US and international politics at the Ireland-based University College Dublin’s Clinton Institute, put the loss to the US economy at $7bn to $14bn. “That loss in gross domestic product, GDP, is estimated to be around 1.5 percent this quarter,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nIf the bill advanced on Sunday would eventually pass and become law, it would bring back furloughed federal workers, repay states that funded federal programmes during the shutdown, prevent further layoffs until January and ensure workers are paid once the shutdown ends.\n\nLucas added that millions of Americans are now paying more than double in premiums for their health insurance as the tax credits are slated to lapse. And there is no surety that the December vote would extend those credits, he said.\n\nHe also pointed out that nearly 42 million Americans have lost their food assistance provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). “No government support for those payments, and the Trump administration has ordered states, which offered food assistance payments, to return that money,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hanna explained that once a cloture vote passes, all later votes on a bill need only a simple majority in the Senate.\n\n“The important thing about the cloture vote is that once it is passed at that 60 percent majority, every subsequent vote is by a simple majority. So it would appear to be plain sailing in the Senate for the Republicans to pass this bill and end this closure,” Hanna said.\n\nIf the Senate eventually passes the bill, the same version of it would have to pass the House and be signed by Trump. This process could take a few days."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is implementing a social media ban for children under 16, effective December 10, 2025, which includes platforms such as Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16\n\nAustralia’s upcoming  social media ban  for children under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31Z","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that mRNA vaccines, developed for COVID-19, may significantly improve survival in cancer patients by 'waking up' the immune system.

And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/explosion-near-red-fort-in-indias-new-delhi","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:46:11+00:00","title":"Police say at least eight killed in blast near Red Fort in India’s Delhi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At least eight people were killed and 20 wounded in a car explosion near the Red Fort in Delhi on November 10, 2025.

are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/8/cop30-climate-summit-hears-from-countries-suffering-global-warming-harms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"09:15:56+00:00","title":"COP30 climate summit hears from countries suffering global warming harms","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, leaders from nations severely affected by climate change—such as Haiti, Kenya, and Barbados—are demanding urgent, equitable climate action.

climate crisis, from hurricanes, floods and more, have urged the United Nations climate conference in Brazil, COP30, to take action.\n\nWorld leaders are gathered on the edge of the fast-dwindling Amazon rainforest in advance of Monday’s official kickoff, with many focusing on  better balancing the gap  between developing nations and richer countries that produce most of the world’s harmful gas emissions.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has emphasised the need for a concrete roadmap to “undo deforestation, overcome fossil fuels and mobilise the resources needed”.\n\nAnother initiative aims to create a shared global carbon market, where those who produce less emissions than their required targets could potentially receive credit and sell it to those who overshoot commitments.\n\nRicher countries pledged $300bn to help poorer nations deal with the wide-ranging impacts of the warming climate at last year’s summit, but no money has been distributed.\n\nMoreover, developing countries and international advocacy groups maintain that the figure is  woefully insufficient to meet the needs , eyeing a goal of $1.3 trillion in various forms of government and private assistance.\n\nDuring the leaders’ meeting on Friday, Haitian diplomat Smith Augustin said  Hurricane Melissa  devastated his country, while small island states are the least responsible for climate change.\n\nKithure Kindiki, Kenya’s vice president, said “a previously once-in-a-century cycle of extreme droughts alternating with devastating floods continues to wipe out lives” in the East African country, which  experienced a deadly landslide last week .\n\nThe prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, said leaders at the summit must “hold our heads down in shame” as a loss and damage fund established in the 2022 conference in Egypt still has a capital base of less than $800m, “while Jamaica reels from damage in excess of $7 billion US, not to mention Cuba, Haiti or the Bahamas”.\n\nMahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chairman of the African Union Commission, said leaders from countries suffering the most harmful impacts of the climate crisis are not asking for charity, but for “climate justice”.\n\nSeveral leaders also criticised the United States, which under President Donald Trump has branded climate change a “hoax” and has refused to send an envoy to the talks while digging deeper into fossil fuels.\n\nThe UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said in its  latest report  earlier this week that it is “very likely” the world will exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) global warming mark – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – within the next decade.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the officials gathered in Brazil that they can choose to lead or be led to ruin.\n\n“Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation, with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress, and too many leaders remain captive to these entrenched interests,” he said.\n\nGuterres also said overshooting 1.5C is inevitable in the short term, “but what matters is how high and for how long”.\n\nThe UN says global emissions must nearly halve by 2030, reach net zero by 2050, and move to net negative thereafter."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kp220561go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:34:33.190+00:00","title":"Dozens of inmates found hanged in Ecuador

Try asking a 'magical question' \n         By Marielle Segarra, Sam Yellowhorse Kesler, Malaka Gharib \n        \n           Thursday, May 29, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         What's the weirdest thing you've ever found in your pocket? What topic could you give a 20-minute talk on with no preparation? What's a path you almost took but didn't? If you find yourself immediately wanting to reply to these queries, there's a reason, says Priya Parker, a conflict resolution facilitator. They were designed to spark curiosity and elicit a response. She calls them \"magical questions.\" \"A magical question is a question that everyone in your group is interested in answering\" and hearing the answers to, says Parker, who hosts  a video series  on the topic on her Instagram page.  She likes asking them in group settings because they have the power to cut through small talk and reveal people's personalities. And people don't need to agree or have the same tastes or experiences to answer. Parker, author of the 2020 book  The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters ,  explains how to develop your own magical questions. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Priya, what are some of the qualities of a magical question?  They help people feel like not just a blob, but a group of individuals. And they help you know something about somebody. One of my favorite magical questions is: What was the first concert you went to, and who took you? I often ask this in team [meetings] or large town halls. Immediately, you get answers like Toni Braxton, Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, New Kids on the Block. So you might think: \"They went to the same concert I went to, how bad can they be?\" They can also be a jumping off point for other types of conversations, you say.  [Let's say you ask]: What's a gift you got that you deeply loved? That is a question that leads to other deeper questions, for example: What's a good gift? What creates meaning? Is it specificity? Empathy? What does it mean to be a generous person? How can we come up with our own magical questions?  Ask yourself: What questions might  everyone  be able to answer that come from the context of the group? That everyone is going to lean in and wait for the answer, but also be excited to share their own? Recently, someone on my Instagram shared that she discovered a magical question while she was in art class. People were talking about how quitting work was contagious. So she asked, \"What's everyone's favorite quitting story?\" Whether they were a musician, a consultant or a teacher, everyone had a story. [The question worked] because it was related to the conversation at hand. What's an example of a not-so-great magical question?  Years ago, when my son was 7 years old, he asked [our family]: What is your favorite animal? Now, that may be a magical question for  him , but not so interesting for the rest of us to either listen to or answer. You have a prompt to help people practice coming up with magical questions.  Imagine you are speaking to a group of dentists. What is the opening question you'd ask them? What was your favorite toothpaste flavor as a kid? Or maybe I'd ask if they expect me to answer their questions when they have their hands in my mouth!  I love it. Your first question is relatively equalizing. Every single dentist was once a child themselves. Some other questions you might ask: What is a Halloween candy you love that you would never recommend to your patients? What's the worst thing that's been said to you while someone was in the dental chair? Who has your favorite smile and why? What's the going rate for the tooth fairy? It sounds like what's required is attunement and presence. Speaking of which, what's the best way to bring up a magical question in conversation?  In some friend groups or group chats, you can be like, \"Y'all, I heard about this amazing thing called 'magical questions.' Are you game?\" Like, yes! In other places, some people are deeply allergic   to anything that feels like an icebreaker. As in all of life, read the room. More magical questions from Priya Parker  What's a gift someone gave you that offended you? What is one rule you had growing up that looking back now ,  you think was totally unnecessary or even a little funny? What are three gifts you would give aliens on behalf of humanity? When was the last time you used glitter? When was the last time you blew up a balloon with your own mouth? What is a favorite building in your community? When did it become so?

resigned over a Trump speech edit?\n\nThe head of the UK’s British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and a top news executive  resigned  from the organisation on Sunday after a memo criticising the editing of a 2021 speech by US President Donald Trump shortly before protesters  stormed the US Capitol  in Washington on January 6, 2021, was leaked.\n\nThe BBC said Director-General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness had chosen to step down after the memo became public.\n\nThe memo was from ex-adviser Michael Prescott, a former journalist who was an independent consultant to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board for three years before leaving in June. He claimed that editors of a 2024 BBC Panorama documentary had spliced two parts of Trump’s speech together so it appeared that he had actively encouraged the Capitol Hill riots of January 6, 2021, which followed his 2020 election defeat.\n\nTrump responded to the pair’s resignation on Sunday night, calling Davie and Turness “very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a presidential election”, in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nDavie said he took “ultimate responsibility” for mistakes made, and had decided to resign after “reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times”.\n\nThe resignations of Davie and Turness followed controversy over a BBC Panorama documentary called “Trump: A Second Chance?”, which was broadcast one week before the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nA clip from the programme appears to show two different parts of Trump’s January 6, 2021 speech joined together into one sequence. In the episode, Trump is shown as saying: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nBut according to a transcript from Trump’s comments that day, he said: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.”\n\nNearly an hour later, Trump then used the phrase “we fight like hell”, but not in reference to the protesters at the Capitol. “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said.\n\nTim Davie became director-general of the BBC in September 2020. He was responsible for overseeing the organisation’s editorial, operational and creative work. He previously led BBC Studios for seven years and worked at companies including Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo.\n\nIn an email to staff on Sunday, Davie said quitting the job after five years “is entirely my decision”. He said he was “working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months”.\n\nMeanwhile, Deborah Turness had been the CEO of BBC News since 2022, leading a team of around 6,000 employees broadcasting to almost half a billion people around the world. She was previously CEO of ITN and president of NBC News.\n\nOver the weekend, Turness said that the controversy over the Trump documentary “has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me”.\n\n“In public life, leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down,” she said in a note to staff. “While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n\nDavid Yelland, former editor of the Sun newspaper, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Monday that Davie and Turness were the victims of a “coup”. However, both they and the BBC deny this.\n\nThe incident prompted criticism of the BBC by Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary, who described the corporation over the weekend as “100 percent fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.\n\nFor his part, Trump  posted  on his Truth Social platform: “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught “doctoring” my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th”.\n\nHe added that “very dishonest people” had “tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election… On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for democracy!”\n\nPrescott’s leaked memo did not only refer to the Panorama editing of Trump’s speech. It also focused criticism on a number of other areas of the BBC’s work, such as its coverage of transgender issues and racism – which he said were “one-sided” and “ill-researched” – but most notably its coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nPrescott accused the BBC of anti-Israel bias within the BBC Arabic service, claiming that contributors over-emphasised stories that were critical of Israel. He also accused the wider corporation of “misrepresenting” the number of women and children killed in Gaza and the issue of Palestinian starvation in the besieged enclave.\n\nThe former BBC adviser said he had sent the memo in “despair at inaction by the BBC Executive” over these and other issues.\n\nCharles Moore, former editor of the Daily Telegraph, a right-wing broadsheet newspaper in the UK, accused the BBC of “the most extraordinary degree of systemic bias, particularly in BBC Arabic” in its coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nOn general news, he told the Today programme, “it’s always [reporting] from a sort of metropolitan left position. Absolutely consistently, that’s how the bias is.”\n\nThe BBC denies that it is institutionally biased, however.\n\nIn February, the United Kingdom’s media regulator Ofcom said a BBC documentary about Palestinian children living through  Israel’s war on Gaza  broke rules on impartiality, as it was narrated by the 13-year-old son of a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas-run government.\n\nFive days after it was broadcast, the BBC removed the documentary Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone from its online streaming platform. In July, the BBC’s own investigation found that the programme had breached its editorial guidelines on accuracy.\n\nBut the BBC has also been accused of being biased in favour of Israel.\n\nIn November, the organisation was accused by more than 100 of its own staff of giving Israel favourable coverage in its reporting of the war on Gaza, and criticised its lack of “accurate evidence-based journalism”.\n\nAn internal letter, signed by more than 100 anonymous staff at the BBC, was sent to Tim Davie and Deborah Turness, stating: “Basic journalistic tenets have been lacking when it comes to holding Israel to account for its actions.”\n\nKarishma Patel, one journalist who quit the BBC over its Gaza coverage, told Al Jazeera: “It is absurd that Panorama’s editorial blunder over Trump’s speech was the final straw for the Director-General and CEO – rather than the worst moments in the BBC’s Gaza coverage across two years: its refusal to air the Gaza medics documentary by Basement Films, significant broadcast of Israel’s defence and not South Africa’s genocide case at the ICJ, public letters signed by BBC journalists concerned about the organisation’s Gaza coverage, some of which I personally organised.\n\n“There have been many crucial moments where we have seen no real accountability and no real change, eroding public and staff trust. “It is very clear that criticisms are only taken seriously if they come via the right wing press, and this influence has shaped the BBC.”\n\nThe BBC, which is funded by a mandatory licence fee payable by all households in the UK that own a television, has long been accused by rival media organisations and politicians of failing to maintain a commitment to impartiality in its coverage of global news and events and of having a “liberal” bias.\n\nIn March 2023, the BBC struggled to contain a scandal over the opinions of  Gary Lineker  – a former professional footballer and its highest-paid sports presenter – on immigration. He was ultimately removed as a presenter of BBC’s Match of the Day show after he criticised the UK government’s asylum-seeker policy, briefly leading to a walkout by some of his colleagues in a show of solidarity.\n\nIn May 2025, controversy over Lineker was reignited after  he shared an Instagram post  about Zionism that included a drawing of a rat, which critics claimed was an anti-Semitic insult.\n\nIn response, Lineker said: “I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am.” The BBC said he would leave the organisation altogether.\n\nElsewhere, the BBC has faced  lasting reputational damage  following revelations that its former TV presenter Jimmy Savile perpetuated decades of sexual abuse, which came to light after his death in 2011.\n\nPosthumous investigations revealed that Savile had exploited his celebrity status and access to BBC facilities to abuse hundreds of victims, many of them children, while complaints to the corporation about his behaviour were ignored and even covered up.\n\nMore recently, the broadcaster was again rocked by allegations involving one of its main news anchors,  Huw Edwards . In 2023, Edwards was accused of paying for up to 41 sexually explicit images he had received on WhatsApp, some of victims aged between seven and nine years.\n\nThe case reignited scrutiny over how the BBC handles staff misconduct, reviving painful questions about trust and oversight within the institution, which eventually admitted that it should have responded to complaints much faster.\n\nSunday’s resignations come at a sensitive time for the BBC, as the government is set to review the corporation’s Royal Charter before the current term expires in 2027.\n\nThe Royal Charter sets out the terms and purpose of the BBC’s operations, and normally lasts for about a decade each time it is renewed.\n\nUK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, who has previously called allegations of bias “incredibly serious”, said a review of the Charter by the government would help the BBC “adapt to this new era”.\n\nJonah Hull, reporting for Al Jazeera in London, said “this is a hugely significant moment for the BBC … arguably the most famous news media brand, built on a reputation of journalistic integrity and impartiality”.\n\nIn addition to the recent scandal over the misleading editing of a Trump speech, Hull said the BBC had also suffered criticism for its coverage of “trans-rights issues, Israel bias … all of which has led to a furore of criticism aimed at the BBC”.\n\nBBC Chair Samir Shah, who apologised for an “error of judgement” over the editing of Trump’s speech in the Panorama programme on Monday, but denied that the BBC is guilty of systemic bias, is due to lay out a vision for the BBC’s future on Monday to Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee.\n\nAt the daily briefing for journalists at 10 Downing Street on Monday, the prime minister’s spokesman also said he does not believe the BBC is “institutionally biased”."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g38y78xymo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"00:31:07.986+00:00","title":"The Death of Bunny Munro: Nick Cave and Matt Smith on bringing a sex addict salesman to life","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Death of Bunny Munro, a TV series based on Nick Cave's 2009 novel, features Matt Smith as Bunny Munro — a chaotic, sex-obsessed salesman grappling with grief after his wife's suicide.

Smith playing Bunny Munro - the sex-obsessed door-to-door salesman from his 2009 novel The Death of Bunny Munro - he was taken aback.\n\n\"In the book, Bunny's not good at what he does - he wants to sleep with everyone he can and he's an unsuccessful lothario who women treat like a joke,\" Cave explains.\n\n\"Whereas Matt is hot and that adds a complexity that the original Bunny didn't have because when Matt's Bunny hits on women, they kind of like it and he draws them in.\"\n\nThe Australian musician's darkly comic tale of sex, guilt and grief has been reimagined as a TV series with Doctor Who and The Crown star Smith taking on the titular role of a man spiralling after his wife's suicide.\n\nHaving kidnapped his son, Bunny sets off on a chaotic road trip, clinging to his job and desires as everything else falls apart around him.\n\nSmith says that he signed up to play Bunny immediately after he first me Cave - and thought the role was \"an amazing opportunity and challenge to play a man pushed to the edge by grief, sex and life\".\n\nFor Cave, the project revisits one of his morally complex characters and the 68-year-old stands by the fact that Bunny isn't wholly a bad person.\n\n\"When I look at Bunny, I don't see an aberration,\" he says. \"He's a flawed human being struggling with grief, his own legacy and all the things that make us human.\"\n\nSmith agrees and his version of Bunny is more beguiling and dangerous, and his appeal makes his downfall harder to dismiss.\n\n\"He's selfish and difficult, but also funny, mad and kind of charismatic,\" he explains. \"He's human and I saw the good in him, thought he was quite funny and became quite attached to him.\"\n\nIt's that tension of Bunny being both repellent and relatable that gives the story its emotional punch.\n\nSmith says that beneath the chaos, it's \"a really touching story about a father and son\".\n\nCave nods in agreement, adding that the tale of Bunny makes him want to hug his kids.\n\n\"It's a reminder of the vulnerability of our children and of the need to hold them while there's still time.\"\n\nSet in 2003 in Brighton, the adaptation turns Cave's novel into a period piece that feels close enough to the present day but distant enough to reflect how the world, and its tolerance for men like Bunny, has changed.\n\nBut both men resist saying that the show makes a statement about masculinity.\n\n\"That's for other people to decide,\" Smith says. \"But for me, it's really a story about the sins of the father and about Bunny Junior breaking that cycle.\"\n\nCave calls it a story about inheritance - what we carry from our parents and what we choose to leave behind.\n\n\"Little Bunny needs to get away from his father as he's chaotic and a threat to his safety but Bunny is essentially good and we wouldn't want his son to escape those parts of him.\"\n\nThe singer also suggests it's much deeper than an exploration of masculinity as it reflects \"how we deal with our own nature and humanity.\"\n\nThat sense of humanity has always been at the core of Cave's work and his music with The Bad Seeds is \"essentially autobiographical\".\n\nIn 2015, Cave's son Arthur died after falling from a cliff in Brighton and in 2022 his eldest son, Jethro, died at the age of 30.\n\nThe singer has previously written about the  \"vastness\" of his grief  and about how the  death of his sons changed him.\n\nHe also moved to Los Angeles because \"Brighton had just become too sad\" but he later returned after he \"realised that, regardless of where we lived, we just took our sadness with us\".\n\n\"If you listen to my songs and the words, they paint a very clear picture of what I'm like and what I've gone through,\" he tells the BBC. \"Even the despicable characters, they're not removed from me, they are just part of a complex character.\"\n\nIn contrast, Cave explains that Bunny Munro isn't autobiographical but there is some overlap between his life and that of his creation.\n\n\"I wasn't writing about someone I didn't understand,\" he says. \"I felt extremely connected to Bunny - not that I went around trying to seduce women, though there was a bit of that, being in a band and all – but that interior masculine monologue, that first impulse towards being in the world.\n\n\"Most men, if they're honest, understand Bunny on some level.\"\n\nHowever, Cave says that where he differs most from Bunny is when it comes to women as he's \"much shyer around women\".\n\nHis confession strips away any rock-star bravado as he admits that he's \"quite terrified of women and their power and I've just never been that comfortable around them\".\n\nThe Death of Bunny Munro is on Sky Atlantic from 20 November."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw001kw97o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:06:02.281+00:00","title":"BBC chair Samir Shah apologises for Panorama

It also highlights the Panorama edit.\n\nOn Monday, BBC chair Samir Shah accepted an \"error of judgement\" had been made on the documentary and that the edited speech gave the impression of a \"direct call for action\" - and said the BBC would like to apologise for it.\n\nBut responding to a letter from the Culture Media and Sport Committee, he said it was \"simply not true\" the memo had uncovered issues the BBC had \"sought to bury\" -  nor was it correct to suggest the BBC had done nothing to tackle concerns raised in the memo.\n\nTrump's letter, which the BBC received on Sunday, calls for an apology and for the corporation to \"appropriately compensate\" the president.\n\nIt accuses the BBC of making \"false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading, and inflammatory statements\" about him.\n\nTrump's attorney Alejandro Brito also accused the BBC of defamation under Florida law.\n\nIn his letter to the committee, Shah said   the BBC had received more than 500 complaints since the memo's publication.\n\nThe Panorama edit had been discussed by the committee in January and May this year as part of a wider review of the BBC's US election coverage, he said.\n\nPrescott and some committee members voiced concern about it then, he added.\n\nShah added he \"also heard from BBC News that the purpose of editing the clip was to convey the message of the speech\".\n\nThis was so Panorama's audience \"could better understand how it had been received by President Trump's supporters and what was happening on the ground at that time\".\n\nThe point was not pursued further \"given it had not attracted significant audience feedback and had been transmitted before the US election,\" he explained.\n\nHe added: \"With hindsight, it would have been better to take more formal action.\"\n\nIn Trump's speech on 6 January 2021, he said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"\n\nIn the Panorama programme, he was shown saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you.

2025-11-10T10:04:06+00:00\n\nTitle: UN warns of millions displaced by climate change as COP30 opens in Brazil\n\nClimate-related disasters and conflict have displaced millions of people across the globe, the United Nations has warned before the opening of its annual climate change conference.\n\nThe UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a report, published on Monday to coincide with the launch of the 30th annual UN Climate Change conference (COP) in Brazil, that weather-related disasters caused about 250 million people to flee their homes over the past decade.\n\nThe migration agency issued its second major report on the effect of climate change on refugees – No Escape II: The Way Forward – in the run-up to COP 30, as it appears that the enthusiasm of countries to agree action to curb climate change continues to ebb.\n\n“Over the past decade, weather-related disasters have caused some 250 million internal displacements – equivalent to over 67,000 displacements per day,” the report said .\n\nThe UNHCR added that climate change is also increasing the difficulties faced by those displaced by conflict and other driving forces.\n\n“Climate change is compounding and multiplying the challenges faced by those who have already been displaced, as well as their hosts, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings,” it continued.\n\nFloods in South Sudan and Brazil, record heat in Kenya and Pakistan, and water shortages in Chad and Ethiopia are among the disasters noted in the report.\n\nThe number of countries facing extreme exposure to climate-related hazards is projected to rise from three to 65 by 2040.\n\nThose 65 countries host more than 45 percent of all people currently displaced by conflict, it added.\n\n“Extreme weather is … destroying homes and livelihoods, and forcing families – many who have already fled violence – to flee once more,” UN refugees chief Filippo Grandi said in a statement.\n\n“These are people who have already endured immense loss, and now they face the same hardships and devastation again. They are among the hardest hit by severe droughts, deadly floods and record-breaking heatwaves, yet they have the fewest resources to recover,” he said.\n\nBy 2050, the report reads, the hottest 15 refugee camps in the world – in The Gambia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Senegal and Mali – are projected to experience nearly 200 days of hazardous heat stress per year.\n\nThe refugee agency’s report emphasised that while the effect of climate change is growing, the commitment towards dealing with it has been weakening.\n\nThe UNHCR hopes to reawaken efforts to fight the effects at the conference in Brazil.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States, traditionally the world’s top donor, has  slashed foreign aid .\n\nWashington previously accounted for more than 40 percent of the UNHCR’s budget. Other major donor countries have also been tightening their belts.\n\n“Funding cuts are severely limiting our ability to protect refugees and displaced families from the effects of extreme weather,” Grandi said.\n\n“To prevent further displacement, climate financing needs to reach the communities already living on the edge,” he said. “This COP must deliver real action, not empty promises.”\n\nAbout 50,000 participants from more than 190 countries will meet in Belem, in the Amazon rainforest, to discuss curbing the climate crisis.\n\nOne topic on the agenda exposing the difficulties of agreeing on global action is the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\n\nThe policy is designed to prevent “carbon leakage” by requiring importers of carbon-intensive goods like steel and cement to pay the same price for embedded emissions that EU producers face domestically.\n\nWhile the EU promotes CBAM as a necessary environmental tool to encourage greener practices, critics of the policy, including major trading partners like the US and China, view it as a veiled act of protectionism.\n\nDeveloping nations, meanwhile, are concerned that it unfairly shifts the financial burden of climate action onto them."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43pp456gyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"23:03:38.464+00:00","title":"Booker Prize: David Szalay's Flesh wins 2025 fiction award","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Szalay's novel Flesh has won the 2025 Booker Prize, praised by judges for its singularity, minimalist style, and profound exploration of themes such as class, power, intimacy, migration, and masculinity.

defeat IS group after Trump meeting\n\nSyria will join the international coalition to combat the Islamic State group, marking a shift in US foreign policy in the Middle East, a senior Trump administration official confirmed to CBS, the BBC's US media partner.\n\nThe announcement came as President Donald Trump met Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House - the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.\n\nDiplomatic relations between Syria and the US have been suspended since 2012, although Trump has moved to restore them after the fall of the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\n\nTrump has expressed his support for al-Sharaa, who until recently was designated a terrorist by the US government.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office several hours after the meeting, Trump said that \"we want to see Syria become a country that's very successful.\"\n\n\"And I think this leader can do it,\" he added. \"I really do.\"\n\nTrump said more \"announcements\" are forthcoming, although he provided no details.\n\nThis is the third meeting between the two leaders, following one in May on the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council and a dinner during the UN General Assembly in September.\n\nAl-Sharaa's visit to the White House caps a remarkable re-branding for the former jihadist.\n\nNot long ago, he led a branch of Al-Qaeda - the group behind the 9/11 attacks and many others - before breaking off ties.\n\nEven until this year, he was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an armed Islamist group which the US officially considered a terrorist organisation until four months ago, with a $10m bounty on his head.\n\nThe Treasury Department removed al-Sharaa from its \"specially designated global terrorist list\" just last week.\n\nBut since becoming interim Syrian president, al-Sharaa has worked to soften his public image as he tries to rebuild Syria, with foreign support, following 13 years of war.\n\n\"He has had a rough past,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And I think, frankly, if you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance.\"\n\nAl-Sharaa's rule, however, has been marred by killings of members of Syria's Alawite minority, as well as by deadly violence between Sunni Bedouin fighters and Druze militias.\n\nHe has vowed to root out members of his security forces that have committed human rights violations.\n\nTrump, for his part, has repeatedly expressed support for al-Sharaa, referring to him as a \"young, attractive guy\" and a \"fighter\" with a \"strong past\".\n\nIn June, President Trump signed an executive order lifting sanctions against Syria, which the White House said would help support the country's \"path to stability and peace\".\n\nAt the time, the administration said it would monitor the new Syrian government's actions, including \"taking steps toward normalising ties with Israel\" and addressing \"foreign terrorists\" and militant groups operating in the country."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3zpdvxz3zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:49:08.858+00:00","title":"Nord Stream suspect accuses Italy of pressure

where he has accused the authorities of mistreating him to make him confess to blowing up Russia's Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea in 2022.\n\nSerhiy Kuznetsov was detained in Italy in August on an arrest warrant from Germany.\n\nIn a letter shown to the BBC by his lawyer, Mr Kuznetsov says he is being treated as \"criminal no.1\", held in a high-security facility alongside suspected members of so-called Islamic State (IS or Isis). The BBC has contacted the prison, but it has not yet commented.\n\nNo-one has admitted carrying out the attack on the pipelines carrying Russian gas to Germany.\n\nIn his first public comment since his arrest, Mr Kuznetsov writes - by hand - that \"the Italians have been cynically ignoring my dietary habits for the past two months\" - a reference to his vegetarian diet.\n\n\"They think that these restrictions can affect my position, and make me confess my guilt. But such efforts are futile.\"\n\nA relative of Mr Kuznetsov's told me they had tried to deliver special food to the prison, but had been refused - and they were worried that he seemed \"exhausted\".\n\nThe Nord Stream pipelines were destroyed deep beneath the Baltic Sea at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt was a high profile and controversial attack.\n\nMany initially suspected Russian involvement and an attempt by Moscow to blackmail Europe by restricting its energy supplies.\n\nBut this summer, German prosecutors activated arrest warrants for two of the men they suspect of carrying out the attack: Serhiy Kuznetsov and a second Ukrainian citizen, Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was detained in Poland.\n\nGerman prosecutors have cited charges of \"anti-constitutional sabotage\" as a basis for the extradition requests.\n\nA judge in Warsaw ruled against Mr Zhuravlyov's extradition , saying that, if Ukrainians were involved, such an attack would count as legitimate self-defence in a \"bloody, genocidal war\".\n\nIn Italy, by contrast, a court in Bologna last month approved Serhiy Kuznetsov's extradition in a closed hearing. He is currently appealing against that ruling for a second time.\n\n\"He told me he had lost 9kg when I said that his clothes were hanging loosely,\" the Ukrainian's lawyer, Nicola Canestrini, said, after visiting his client on hunger strike.\n\nThe lawyer said Kuznetsov was refusing all solid food but was \"doing fine and is clear of mind\".\n\nSerhiy Kuznetsov complains in his letter about having to exercise in isolation and under armed guard and being subjected to \"maximum restrictions\".\n\nHis lawyer told the BBC that he himself felt that Mr Kuznetsov had been \"abandoned\" by the Ukrainian government \"like an old boot\".\n\n\"He was in the army, so they should know was he there or not? If he was there, they should protect him - if not, they should protect him as well,\" he argues, referring to the attack.\n\nUkrainian officials have always denied any involvement. They declined to comment again recently when approached by the BBC.\n\nOn Sunday, the human rights ombudsman in Kyiv, Dmytro Lubinets, said an adviser was looking into the case and would check on the prison conditions.\n\nIn his letter, Mr Kuznetsov says that he understands that his government \"currently has more important matters to attend to, searching for an end to the war\".\n\nHe ends on a patriotic note, writing: \"I love Ukraine very much and am happy to have the honour of being an officer in its armed forces.\"\n\nHis final appeal hearing in Italy is due in the next couple of weeks."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4w1g9ezko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"00:31:56.714+00:00","title":"Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion to be sentenced over £5bn Bitcoin stash","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Chinese woman, Qian Zhimin, is set to be sentenced in the UK for orchestrating a massive financial fraud targeting over 100,000 Chinese investors through a company called Lantian Gerui, which falsely promised high returns from cryptocurrency mining.

2025-11-11T00:31:56.714+00:00\n\nTitle: Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion to be sentenced over £5bn Bitcoin stash\n\nA woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, is due to be sentenced this week for money laundering.\n\nAfter fleeing China, she moved to a mansion in Hampstead, north London. The Metropolitan Police raided it a year later and made one of the world's single largest crypto seizures.\n\nMore than 100,000 Chinese people invested their money in her company - which claimed to be developing high-tech health products and mining cryptocurrency. In reality, she embezzled the funds, police say. As she awaits sentencing, investors have told the BBC World Service they hope to get at least some of their cash back from the UK authorities.\n\nAnything left unclaimed would normally default to the UK government - leading some to speculate that the Treasury could stand to gain from the haul.\n\n\"If we can gather all the evidence together, we hope the UK government, the Crown Prosecution Service and the High Court can show compassion,\" said one victim we are calling Mr Yu, who says his marriage failed as a result of the fraud. \"Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost.\"\n\nQian Zhimin, 47, arrived in the UK under a fake passport in September 2017, after  Chinese police started investigating her .\n\nShe moved into a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, at a rent of more than £17,000 ($22,700) a month. To pay for this, she needed to convert her Bitcoin stash back into money she could spend.\n\nSo she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property.\n\nAs Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could \"get rich while lying down\". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping.\n\nBut Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke.\n\nHer grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022.\n\nIn the meantime, Qian had Wen look for houses she could buy in London. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth.\n\nPolice raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history.\n\nQian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. Lantian Gerui, or Bluesky Greet in English, claimed to use investors' money to mine - or generate - new Bitcoin, and to invest in a range of pioneering technological devices.\n\nBut UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme.\n\n\"The more information we got about her involvement… that she was actually the leader of the fraud, not just a lower down member… it became obvious that yes she's very clever, she's very switched on, very manipulative, able to persuade a lot of people,\" Det Con Joe Ryan from the Met told the BBC.\n\nOne of her investo r s, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day.\n\n\"That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company,\" he says.\n\nHe and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. They were told, he says, they would make a 200% profit over two and a half years. They were soon taking out thousands of pounds' worth of loans at interest rates of up to 8%, in order to invest more.\n\nIn addition, Mr Yu reinvested his daily payouts back into the company as soon as he received them.\n\n\"There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. They just pumped up our dreams… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment.\"\n\nInvestors saw their daily payouts topped up for each new person they signed up. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found.\n\nA former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends.\n\nLantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: \"We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance.\"\n\nThe company also organised mass holidays and banquets for current and potential investors. These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready.\n\nLantian Gerui also trumpeted its love of China as a nation, another ploy calculated to appeal to the elderly.\n\n\"Our patriotism was our Achilles' heel, that's what they exploited,\" says Mr Yu, who is in his 60s. \"They said that they wanted to make China number one in the world.\"\n\nA range of speakers endorsed the company, including the son-in-law of the late Chairman Mao, the founding father of the People's Republic of China - Mr Yu said.\n\n\"We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?\"\n\nThe company even held an event in the Great Hall of the People, where China's legislature meets, according to an investor who attended the event and two others we spoke to.\n\n\"That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red,\" Mr Yu says.\n\nDespite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog.\n\nBut she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li.\n\n\"Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck,\" he remembers. \"We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth.\n\n\"She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations.\"\n\nMr Li, his wife, and his brother, invested some 10m yuan ($1.3m, £1m) between them.\n\nA Chinese police investigation into Lantian Gerui, launched in mid-2017, signalled the beginning of the end for Qian's scheme.\n\n\"The payouts suddenly stopped,\" Mr Yu recalls. \"The company said the police were doing some checks… though we were promised that payments would resume soon enough.\"\n\nWhat helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police.\n\nWhat he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money.\n\nQian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project.\n\nWhen she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told.\n\nAt the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency.\n\nMr Li told the BBC this offered victims a \"glimpse of sunlight\".\n\nThe cryptocurrency Qian brought to the UK has multiplied more than 20 times in value since her arrival. Its fate will be decided by a  civil \"proceeds of crime\" case  that will start in earnest early next year.\n\nThere are thousands of Chinese investors planning to make a claim in this case, say lawyers from two firms representing victims. But this will not be easy, one of them - a Chinese lawyer who asked to remain anonymous - told us.

rocked the global car industry\n\nIn late September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era emergency law to take control of a Chinese-owned chip company that has operations in the country.\n\nThe extraordinary move set off a chain of events that sent shock waves through the global motor industry – already battered by US tariffs and China's curbs on rare earth exports.\n\nIn a statement to the Netherlands parliament, the minister of economic affairs cited \"serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia\" that \"posed a threat\".\n\n\"This measure is highly exceptional and intended solely to ensure that the continuity of supply and safeguarding of critical technologies for the Dutch and European economy are not put at risk,\" the statement said.\n\nBeijing reacted furiously, accusing the Netherlands of political interference.\n\nIt imposed export controls and halted deliveries of Nexperia chips from its Chinese facilities to Europe, while the Dutch government froze shipments of key supplies needed to make the chips in China.\n\nThe disruption caused to the motor industry highlighted a major weakness in the global supply chain of chips vital to car production and opened yet another front in the rivalry between the US and China.\n\nThe Chinese government has now granted exemptions to export controls  on the chips for civilian applications but has not clarified what it considers those to be.\n\nBut Chinese authorities still want the Dutch to revoke the takeover of Nexperia.\n\n\"China welcomes the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible,\" the commerce ministry said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nNexperia's parent company Wingtech Technology did not respond to a  BBC request for comment.\n\nAt the centre of the dispute is a critical part of the world's chip ecosystem.\n\nNexperia makes so called \"legacy\" or \"building block\" semiconductors that are vital for everything from power-steering and airbags to central locking systems. These are not cutting-edge chips, but they are still indispensable.\n\nSome vehicles contain hundreds of them, and Nexperia supplies chips to major carmakers around the world.\n\nAround 70%-80% of its output is sent to China for processing, testing and packaging – a dependence that has left car makers exposed to Beijing's control over supply chains.\n\n\"Car markers blindsided by the Nexperia mess should be hiring new supply chain management executives, as they clearly learned nothing from Covid... and excessive reliance on [Chinese] supply chains,\" China watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter.\n\nIt underscores China's ability to choke off global supply chains - just as it did with rare earth exports.\n\nSimilar to critical minerals, China can hold the West hostage with control of a company as inconspicuously important as Nexperia, according to Bill Echikson, Senior Fellow for the Tech Policy Program at Center for European Policy Analysis. This is as much about digital sovereignty as it is about semiconductors, he adds.\n\nBeijing faces a dilemma though. It has been pitching itself as a reliable partner in the face of Trump's tariff chaos, but cutting off supplies of critical products risks undermining that message.\n\n\"The narrative was [that, since]   Trump came in and caused chaos for everybody, maybe there's an opportunity for China and the EU to work more closely together,\" said Tom Nunlist, Associate Director at Trivium China.\n\nThat didn't go so well, he adds, with the rare earths shortage showing how trapped Europe and other trading partners are between the US and China, and their ability to upend global trade, according to Mr Nunlist.\n\nAlong with the takeover, a Dutch court also suspended Nexperia's former chief executive Zhang Xuezhen - who founded its Chinese owner Wingtech - citing mismanagement.\n\nWingtech's shares trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and it is partially owned by the Chinese government.\n\nIt was placed on an official US watch list in 2024, and the so-called entity list was expanded this September to include any firm that is at least 50% owned by companies already on the list.\n\nAccording to court papers released by the Dutch authorities last month in relation to the government's takeover of Nexperia, US authorities had raised concerns about the boss of the chip company before it was taken over.\n\nThe documents contained evidence that Dutch authorities had told Nexperia it may be able to secure an exemption from the US list if there was a change in leadership because the \"Chinese owner is problematic\".\n\n\"It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced to qualify for the exemption from the entity list,\" authorities told Nexperia, according to the documents.\n\nThe Hague denies the takeover of Nexperia was a response to pressure from any foreign country but said there was evidence to suggest the company's   chief executive was transferring its production capacity, financial resources and intellectual property to China.\n\nWingtech did not respond to a request for comment on this.\n\n\"I think Nexperia just underlines what is already true, and makes it truer,\" said Mr Nunlist from Trivium China.\n\n\"Western countries don't want Chinese investors in these types of strategic manufacturing assets, even legacy chips.\"\n\nExperts say the incident is an example of the very real impact of undoing business and economic ties between the West and China.\n\n\"This is what decoupling actually looks like at the corporate level, and it's a huge mess,\" said Mr Nunlist.\n\nEuropean vehicle industry suppliers have sought clarity on the exemptions that will be applied, and have said it creates extra bureaucracy at an already uncertain time.\n\nIt is possible to switch suppliers, say experts, as rivals chip makers like Infineon, NXP and Texas make similar chips.\n\nBut supply chains are not precisely planned, they evolve organically and these components are often tailor made for autos, Mr Nunlist of Trivium China said.\n\n\"Companies can't move on a dime; there are incentives to keep supply chains in place and it's extremely complicated and costly to change things.\"\n\nThe incident comes as US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year trade truce - a deal which suspended some export bans and rare earth restrictions.\n\nBut the Nexperia dispute suggests that this newly-minted agreement may be a fragile one.\n\nThe US is not going to blow up the deal though, according to Mr Nunlist, and Europe doesn't have much leverage especially in this game of supply chain weaponisation.\n\n\"This is really politically tricky for both sides, and for Europe because it doesn't want this to end with chip capacity leaving Europe,\" Mr Nunlist said.\n\n\"My understanding is that leaders in Brussels were unaware that the Dutch government was planning to make this move and were unhappy with it.\"\n\nChina and the EU remain locked in urgent negotiations to lift export controls on both chips and rare earths.\n\nTalks are continuing with China on finding a \"lasting, stable, predictable framework that ensure the full restoration of semiconductor flows\", EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said in a post on X over the weekend.\n\nBut the episode has exposed vulnerabilities in key supply chains - and ties between China and the Netherlands, and in turn the European Union, are likely to remain under pressure until the discord over Nexperia's ownership and operations is fully resolved."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l104k4vxo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:55:49.073+00:00","title":"Trial for suspect of deadly Magdeburg market attack begins","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A trial has begun in Germany for Taleb A., a Saudi Arabian doctor, accused of carrying out a deadly attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg on December 20, 2024, killing six people and injuring over 300.

hacking kingpin reveals all to the BBC\n\nAfter years of reading about \"Tank\" and months of planning a visit to him in a Colorado prison, I hear the door click open before I see him walk into the room.\n\nI stand up ready to give this former cyber-crime kingpin a professional hello. But, like a cheeky cartoon character, he pokes his head around a pillar with a giant grin on his face and winks.\n\nTank, whose real name is Vyacheslav Penchukov, climbed to the top of the cyber-underworld not so much with technical wizardry, but with criminal charm.\n\n\"I am a friendly guy, I make friends easily,\" the 39-year-old Ukrainian says, with a broad smile.\n\nHaving friends in high places is said to be one of the reasons Penchukov managed to evade police for so long. He spent nearly 10 years on the FBI's Most Wanted list and was a leader of two separate gangs in two distinct periods of cyber-crime history.\n\nIt is rare to speak to such a high-level cyber-criminal who has left so many victims behind him; Penchukov spoke to us for six hours over two days as part of the ongoing podcast series Cyber Hack: Evil Corp.\n\nThe exclusive interview - Penchukov's first ever - reveals the inner workings of these prolific cyber-gangs, the mindset of some of the individuals behind them and never-before-known details about hackers still at large - including the alleged leader of the sanctioned Russian group, Evil Corp.\n\nIt took more than 15 years for authorities to finally arrest Penchukov in a dramatic operation in Switzerland in 2022.\n\n\"There were snipers on the roof and the police put me on the ground and handcuffed me and put a bag on my head on the street in front of my kids. They were scared,\" he recalls with annoyance.\n\nHe is still bitter about how he was arrested, arguing that it was over the top. His thousands of victims around the world would strongly disagree with him: Penchukov and the gangs he either led or was a part of stole tens of millions of pounds from them.\n\nIn the late 2000s, he and the infamous Jabber Zeus crew used revolutionary cyber-crime tech to steal directly from the bank accounts of small businesses, local authorities and even charities. Victims saw their savings wiped out and balance sheets upended. In the UK alone, there were more than 600 victims, who lost more than £4m ($5.2m) in just three months.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, Penchukov set his sights higher, joining the thriving ransomware ecosystem with gangs that targeted international corporations and even a hospital.\n\nEnglewood Correctional Facility, where Penchukov is being held, would not let us take any recording equipment inside the prison, so a producer and I make notes during the interview as we are watched over by a guard nearby.\n\nThe first thing that stands out about Penchukov is that, although he is eager to be released, he seems in high spirits and is clearly making the most of his time in prison. He tells me he plays a lot of sport, is learning French and English - a well-thumbed Russian-English dictionary stays by his side throughout our interview - and is racking up high-school diplomas. He must be smart, I suggest. \"Not smart enough - I'm in prison,\" he jokes.\n\nEnglewood is a low-security prison with good facilities. The low-rise but sprawling building sits in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. The dusty grass verges surrounding the prison are teeming with noisy prairie dogs scurrying into their burrows whenever disturbed by prison vehicles coming and going.\n\nIt is a long way from Donetsk, Ukraine, where he ran his first cyber-crime gang after falling into hacking through games cheat forums, where he would look for cheats for his favourite video games like Fifa 99 and Counterstrike.\n\nHe became the leader of the prolific Jabber Zeus crew - so named because of their use of the revolutionary Zeus malware and their favourite communication platform, Jabber.\n\nPenchukov worked with a small group of hackers that included Maksim Yakubets - a Russian who would go on to be sanctioned by the US government, accused of leading the infamous cyber-group Evil Corp.\n\nPenchukov says that throughout the late 2000s, the Jabber Zeus crew would work out of an office in the centre of Donetsk, putting in six to seven-hour days stealing money from victims overseas. Penchukov would often end his day with a DJ set in the city, playing under the name DJ Slava Rich.\n\nCyber-crime in those days was \"easy money\", he says. The banks had no idea how to stop it and police in the US, Ukraine and the UK could not keep up.\n\nIn his early 20s, he was making so much money he bought himself \"new cars like they were new clothes\". He had six in total - \"all expensive German ones\".\n\nBut police got a breakthrough when they managed to eavesdrop on the criminals' text chats in Jabber and discovered the true identity of Tank using details he had given away about the birth of his daughter.\n\nThe net closed in on the Jabber Zeus crew, and an FBI-led operation called Trident Breach saw arrests in Ukraine and the UK. But Penchukov slipped through the net thanks to a tip-off from someone he will not name. And thanks to one of his fast cars.\n\n\"I had an Audi S8 with a 500-horsepower Lamborghini engine so when I saw the cops flashing lights in my rear view mirror, I jumped the red light and lost them easily. It gave me a chance to test the full power of my car,\" he says.\n\nHe laid low with a friend for a while, but when the FBI left Ukraine, the local authorities seemed to lose interest in him.\n\nSo Penchukov kept under the radar and, he says, went straight. He started a company buying and selling coal, but the FBI was still on the trail.\n\n\"I was on holiday in Crimea when I got a message from a friend who saw that I had been put on the FBI Most Wanted list. I thought I had got away with it all - then I realised I have a new problem,\" he says, an obvious understatement.\n\nHis lawyer at the time was calm, though, and advised him not to worry: as long as he did not travel outside of Ukraine or Russia, US police could not do much.\n\nThe Ukrainian authorities did eventually come knocking - but not to arrest him.\n\nPenchukov had been outed as a wealthy hacker wanted by the West and he alleges that almost every day, officials would come and shake him down for money.\n\nHis coal-selling business was going well until Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. President Putin's so-called \"Little Green Men\" - Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms - ruined his business and missiles struck his apartment in Donetsk, damaging his daughter's bedroom.\n\nPenchukov says that it was business troubles and the constant payouts to Ukrainian officials that led him to once again fire up his laptop and get back into the cyber-crime life.\n\n\"I just decided it was the fastest way to make money to pay them,\" he says.\n\nHis journey charts the evolution of modern cyber-crime - from quick and easy bank account theft to ransomware, today's most pernicious and damaging type of cyber-attack used in high-profile hacks this year, including on UK High Street stalwart Marks & Spencer.\n\nHe says ransomware was harder work but the money was good. \"Cyber-security had improved a lot, but we were able to make about $200,000 a month. Much higher profits.\"\n\nIn a revealing anecdote, he remembers rumours that started about a crew being paid $20m (£15.3m) from a hospital that had been crippled by ransomware.\n\nPenchukov says the news fired up the hundreds of hackers in the criminal forums who all then went after US medical institutions to repeat the pay day. These hacker communities have a \"herd mentality\", he says: \"People don't care about the medical side of things - all they see is 20 millions being paid.\"\n\nPenchukov rebuilt his connections and skills to become one of the top affiliates of ransomware services, including Maze, Egregor and the prolific group Conti.\n\nWhen asked if these criminal groups worked with Russian security services - a regular accusation from the West - Penchukov shrugs and says: \"Of course.\" He says that some ransomware gang members sometimes talked about speaking to \"their handlers\" in the Russian security services, like the FSB.\n\nThe BBC wrote to the Russian Embassy in London, asking if the Russian government or its intelligence agencies engaged with cyber criminals to aid cyber espionage, but received no reply.\n\nPenchukov soon rose to the top again and became a leader of IcedID - a gang that infected more than 150,000 computers with malicious software and led to various types of cyber-attack, including ransomware. Penchukov was in charge of a team of hackers who would sift through the infected computers to work out how best to make money from them.\n\nOne victim they infected with ransomware in 2020 was the University of Vermont Medical Center in the US. According to US prosecutors, this led to the loss of more than $30m (£23m) and left the medical centre unable to provide many critical patient services for more than two weeks.\n\nAlthough no-one died, prosecutors say the attack, which disabled 5,000 hospital computers, created a risk of death or serious injury to patients. Penchukov denies he actually did it, claiming he only admitted to it in order to reduce his sentence.\n\nOverall, Penchukov, who has since changed his surname to Andreev, feels the two nine-year sentences he is serving concurrently are too much for what he did (he is hoping to get out much sooner). He has also been ordered to pay $54m (£41.4m) in restitution to victims.\n\nHis view as a young hacker who started in cyber-crime as a teenager is that Western companies and people could afford to lose money and that everything was covered by insurance anyway.\n\nBut when I speak to one of his early victims from the Jabber Zeus days, it is clear his attacks did have a harmful impact on innocent people.\n\nLieber's Luggage, a family-run business in Albuquerque, New Mexico, had $12,000 (£9,200) stolen in one swipe by the gang. Owner Leslee still recalls the shock years later.\n\n\"It was just disbelief and horror when the bank called because we had no idea what had happened, and the bank clearly didn't have any idea,\" she says.\n\nWhile a modest sum, it was devastating for the business, as the money was used for paying rent, buying merchandise and paying staff.\n\nThey did not have any savings to fall back on and, to make matters worse, Leslee's elderly mother was in charge of the company accounts and she blamed herself until the theft was uncovered.\n\n\"We had all of those feelings, the anger, the frustration, the fear,\" she says.\n\nWhen I ask them what they would like to say to the hackers responsible, they think it is futile to try to change the minds of these callous criminals.\n\n\"There's nothing that we could say that would affect him,\" Leslee says.\n\n\"I wouldn't give him the time of day,\" her husband Frank adds.\n\nPenchukov says he did not think about the victims, and he does not seem to do so much now, either. The only sign of remorse in our conversation was when he talked about a ransomware attack on a disabled children's charity.\n\nHis only real regret seems to be that he became too trusting with his fellow hackers, which ultimately led to him and many other criminals being caught.\n\n\"You can't make friends in cyber-crime, because the next day, your friends will be arrested and they will become an informant,\" he says.\n\n\"Paranoia is a constant friend of hackers,\" he says. But success leads to mistakes.\n\n\"If you do cyber-crime long enough you lose your edge,\" he says, wistfully.\n\nAs if to highlight the disloyal nature of the cyber underworld, Penchukov says he deliberately avoided any further contact with his one-time Jabber Zeus collaborator and friend Maksim Yakubets after the Russian was outed and sanctioned in 2019 by Western authorities.\n\nPenchukov says that he noticed a distinct change in the hacker community as people shunned working with Yakubets and many of his alleged Evil Corp associates.\n\nPreviously Penchukov and \"Aqua\", as Yakubets was known, had hung out in Moscow drinking and eating in luxury restaurants. \"He had bodyguards, which I thought was strange - almost like he wanted to show off his wealth or something,\" he says.\n\nBeing ostracised from the cyber crime world did not deter Evil Corp though and last year, the UK's National Crime Agency accused other members of the Yakubets family of being involved in the decade-long crime spree, sanctioning 16 members of the organisation in total.\n\nBut unlike Penchukov, the chances of police collaring him or others in the gang seem low. With a $5m bounty out for information leading to his arrest, Yakubets and his alleged co-conspirators are unlikely to repeat Penchukov's mistake of leaving their country."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4ez53x7do","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:14:13.127+00:00","title":"Second migrant sent to France returns to the UK","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A second migrant, detected through biometric systems, has returned to the UK after being sent to France under the UK-France 'one in, one out' pilot scheme, reinforcing claims that the system is working.

The visit prompted 30 French lawyers to file a complaint against Darmanin, highlighting what they said was a conflict of interest as Darmanin was a former colleague and friend of Sarkozy's.\n\nSpeaking to a court in Paris via video link on Monday morning, Sarkozy described his time in solitary confinement as \"gruelling\" and \"a nightmare\".\n\nHe said he had never had the \"mad idea\" of asking Gaddafi for money and stated he would \"never admit to something I haven't done\".\n\nSarkozy also paid tribute to prison staff who had made his time in prison \"bearable\". \"They have shown exceptional humanity,\" he said.\n\nSarkozy's wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and two of the former president's sons were present in the courtroom to support him.\n\nSarkozy is the first French ex-leader placed behind bars since World War Two Nazi collaborationist leader Philippe Pétain was jailed for treason in 1945.\n\nSince entering prison, Sarkozy has been held in a cell in the isolation wing.\n\nHe had a toilet, a shower, a desk, a small electric hob and a small TV – for which he paid a monthly €14 (£12) fee – and the right to a small fridge.\n\nHe also had the right to receive information from the outside world and family visits, as well as written and phone contact – but was in effect in solitary confinement. He was allowed just one hour a day for exercise, which he did by himself in the wing's segregated courtyard.\n\nTwo bodyguards were stationed in nearby cells, which the interior minister Laurent Nuñez said was due to Sarkozy's status. There was \"obviously a threat against him\", Nuñez said.\n\nSarkozy was president from 2007 to 2012. Ever since he left office, he has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/politics/jeanne-shaheen-stefany-shutdown-deal.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:48:42.141Z","title":"Democrats Are So Angry, One Senator Faces Blowback From Her Daughter","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Democratic Party is deeply divided over a Senate compromise that ended a government shutdown without extending Affordable Care Act subsidies.

measles elimination status, with US on track to follow\n\nCanada has lost its measles elimination status, said the Pan American Health Organization (Paho) on Monday, after failing to curb an outbreak of the virus for 12 consecutive months.\n\nBecause Canada is no longer deemed measles-free, the Americas region as a whole has lost its elimination status, although individually the other countries are still considered to have stamped out the disease.\n\nThe US, however, risks losing its status as well if it does not stop an ongoing outbreak by January. Related cases have now been reported in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina.\n\nCanada's outbreak began last October, with health officials attributing it to fewer people being vaccinated against measles.\n\nAt a news conference on Monday, Paho officials appealed to Canadian governments and the public to ramp up vaccinations, noting that 95% of the population needs to be immunised to stop the spread of measles.\n\n\"This loss represents a setback, but it is also reversible,\" said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, the health organisation's director.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada said in its own statement that it is collaborating with Paho and regional health authorities to improve vaccine rates and strengthen data sharing.\n\nPrior to Monday, Canada had been declared measles-free for three decades. It can regain its elimination status if it can curb spread of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak for at least 12 months.\n\nThe country has reported more than 5,000 measles cases in 2025, with most of them in the provinces of Ontario and Alberta. That is three times the 1,681 cases reported in the US, despite Canada's much smaller population.\n\nThe bulk of the outbreak has been in \"under-vaccinated communities\", Canadian health officials have said.\n\nVaccination rates in Alberta, one of the provinces hit hard by the outbreak, are lower than the 95% threshold, according to provincial data.\n\nOne region, the South Zone, which includes the province's largest city of Calgary, reported only 68% of children under the age of two were immunised against measles as of 2024.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.\n\nCanadian immunologist Dawn Bowdish told the BBC that there are many reasons behind the low vaccination rates, including lack of access to general practitioners, the absence of a national vaccination registry that Canadians could use to check their immunisation status, and the spread of misinformation.\n\nShe also noted a lack of public health outreach to communities that have been hesitant or distrustful of vaccines.\n\n\"It highlights how many of our systems broke down to get us to this point,\" said Prof Bowdish of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n\"I hope that it will be a wake-up call to policymakers, and that it will be enough of a national embarrassment that we remedy some of those systemic issues,\" she added\n\nThe Americas is the first and only region in the world to have been declared measles-free, starting in 2016. That status was then briefly lifted after outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil. The two countries regained elimination status in 2024, in part through coordinated vaccine efforts where millions were immunised.\n\nBut measles has since spread again, now in North America.\n\nAlong with Canada and the United States, Mexico has also seen a surge in cases and now ranks among the top 10 countries with the largest outbreaks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80390pe1vvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"21:43:10.331+00:00","title":"Katie Razzall: Robust leadership needed to steer BBC through crisis","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC is facing a historic crisis triggered by claims of defamatory and misleading reporting in a Panorama documentary, leading to a potential $1 billion lawsuit from former US President Donald Trump.

Razzall: Robust leadership needed to steer BBC through crisis\n\nI don't like the word unprecedented. But I've used it twice in less than 24 hours.\n\nThe first time was on Sunday night, after the resignations of Tim Davie and Deborah Turness. That, in fact, might have involved a bit of overreach.\n\nAfter all, this has happened before at the BBC. Back in 2004, two senior figures departed - admittedly not on the same day, but on subsequent days.\n\nThe then BBC chairman, Gavyn Davies, and the director general, Greg Dyke, resigned in light of the Hutton report.\n\nThat was the inquiry into the death of government scientist Dr David Kelly which found that the BBC's reporting on the Iraq \"sexed-up dossier\" was flawed.\n\nBut my use of unprecedented on Monday feels entirely appropriate.\n\nA US president threatening to sue the BBC for $1bn is completely new territory for the corporation.\n\nWe've seen a succession of US media operations previously cave in as Donald Trump launched lawsuits.\n\nParamount Global paid him $16m to settle a dispute over an interview broadcast on CBS with former vice-president Kamala Harris.\n\nABC News paid him $15m to settle a defamation lawsuit after its anchor falsely claimed he had been found \"liable for rape\".\n\nNow the president has the BBC in his sights. He wants a full retraction of the Panorama documentary, an apology for the \"false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading and inflammatory statements\" made about him in it, and appropriate compensation \"for the harm caused\".\n\nIf he doesn't get them by Friday, he's put the BBC \"on notice\" that he will be looking for damages of \"no less than $1,000,000,000\".\n\nWhether you are a supporter or a detractor of the BBC, I think everyone would agree these are incredibly testing times for the corporation.\n\nEvents have developed rapidly over a week.\n\nFirst we got the series of claims about the Panorama documentary and also wider systemic bias first made in the Telegraph.\n\nSix days later came the resignations of director general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness.\n\nQuickly some were voicing concerns about a politically orchestrated campaign against the BBC from the right. Others said this was all about accountability in the face of gross failures.\n\nNow the BBC faces a potentially very costly legal battle with Donald Trump.\n\nIt should be basking in the success of Celebrity Traitors with the programme's hugely popular finale broadcast just last Thursday. Instead the BBC is plunged into a crisis some would argue of its own making.\n\nIt's taken until Monday to apologise for the Panorama edit and to push back on the notion that the corporation suffers from institutional bias.\n\nThe interview I did with BBC chair Samir Shah should have been done much earlier - with the DG or Deborah Turness last week, as the headlines ramped up.\n\nThe apology should have come then. Now the BBC is on the back foot.\n\nIt will take robust leadership to steer a course through. But two of the leaders most likely to have been able to steady the ship are now on the way out."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n1wj7g8vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"18:30:20.527+00:00","title":"William recalls Kate cancer talk with children","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince William, the Prince of Wales, shares insights from a recent interview in Rio de Janeiro about how he and the Princess of Wales communicate difficult family experiences—such as their own cancer diagnoses—to their children, emphasizing transparency and emotional honesty over secrecy.

‘Chaos has gone’ - quiet streets on Texas border after Trump crackdown\n\nIn Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, the immigration debate has spilled into the streets, sparking almost daily demonstrations while immigration agents ramp up arrests.\n\nBut in El Paso - a city in Texas on the US-Mexico border - the streets are unusually quiet.\n\nA year after the BBC last visited the border to understand the impact of the migrant crisis on the border, sites that were once teeming with migrants lie largely silent.\n\nJust a few years ago, as many as 2,500 migrants once camped outside the city's historic Sacred Heart Catholic church. Many lined the streets sleeping on donated blankets, idling while they waited for food and water to be distributed by local charities.\n\nNow, only a handful of parishioners can be seen coming in and out of the church.\n\nThe same is true of a nearby park and of shelters throughout the city, where migrants once huddled to exchange their experiences of trudging through jungles and deserts or being detained, robbed or nearly kidnapped on their long journeys through Latin America to the border.\n\nThe influx prompted El Paso's government to declare a state of emergency in late 2022 as local shelters ballooned beyond capacity.\n\nThen, when US President Donald Trump came into office in January - elected in part because of his promise to fix the border - the regular flow of migrants into El Paso slowed to a trickle.\n\nIt is a trend that has repeated itself along the length of the 1,900-mile (3,145km) border, from the Pacific Coast in California toTexas' Gulf coast.\n\nFigures for detentions of border crossers are at a 50-year low.\n\nIn September alone - the last month for which complete data is available - 11,647 people were detained along the entirety of the US-Mexico border, compared with 101,000 in September 2024 and 269,700 the same month in 2023.\n\nOne volunteer network, Annunciation House, once ran as many as 22 shelters throughout the region, catering in large part to thousands of migrants paroled into the US to await court dates, often years in the future.\n\nThere are now only two. The relative trickle of migrants - 15 to 20 in each location on a given night - is composed, in part, of those headed back home after years in the US.\n\n\"We have people who entered and were given employment authorisation, or temporary protected status that Trump has taken away, and they can't renew their employment. Then they can't pay rent,\" Annunciation House director Ruben Garcia told the BBC.\n\nOthers, he added, are simply in need of a place to stay while \"they can do the logistics\" of leaving the country.\n\nFor some along the border, the new reality comes as a relief.\n\nDemesio Guerrero, a naturalised US citizen originally from Mexico who lives in eastern Texas, described the border as \"chaos everywhere\" under the Biden administration.\n\n\"There were encampments everywhere along the border, with women, children and old people,\" he said. \"It was totally out of control.\"\n\nThat chaos had now gone, he said, because Trump had a vision for how to fix the problem and did it. \"He did what he had to do, where he had to do it.\"\n\nFor six straight months, administration officials say, not a single undocumented migrant who was arrested was released into the US. Many have been deported, while others remain in immigration detention.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem often declare that, for the first time in US history, the government has full \"operational control\" of the border.\n\nFor the White House, the figures represent a victory - fufilling a campaign promise that the president himself has touted as the one that led him back to the White House for a second term at a time when many Americans were concerned that Joe Biden had lost control.\n\n\"So far, this strategy has proven to be wildly successful,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the BBC. \"We're undoing the pro-illegal immigration policies from the Biden administration that allowed countless illegals into the country. We've secured the border.\"\n\nThe reasons for the low figures - which began falling in Biden's last year in office and rapidly accelerated under Trump - are complex.\n\nOfficials and experts point to a range of factors, including a Mexican crackdown on migrant flows north, the end of most humanitarian parole programmes, much tighter asylum restrictions and increased surveillance with the help of the US military.\n\nUS courts have moved to aggressively prosecute traffickers. On Monday, a 35-year-old resident of El Paso pleaded guilty to involvement in a scheme to smuggle children from Mexico, sometimes using marijuana-laced sweets.\n\nTrump's deportation drive in the US interior has also served as a deterrent to would-be migrants.\n\n\"Not many people are crossing the border, and not that many are even trying,\" one undocumented immigrant, who asked to remain anonymous, said.\n\n\"With Biden, people knew that sooner or later they would be able to come across and stay. It's not like that now.\"\n\nSome Trump supporters living in El Paso said that at times they feared for their safety, and accused the Biden administration of creating an atmosphere that endangered both local residents and migrants.\n\n\"We didn't feel comfortable going out by ourselves anymore,\" said Lorie Randazzo, a lifelong El Paso resident and the president of Greater El Paso Republican Women. \"Almost as soon as Biden hit office, it got bad.\"\n\nIt's not that we don't want the immigrants coming in, she added, but only the best ones, the ones who want to work.\n\nElizabeth Amy Posada, an El Paso native and a former aide to the local Republican congressman, said there used to be \"death everywhere\", referring to migrants dying in the desert or in the Rio Grande, and those who fell victim to cartels.\n\n\"Everyone should be happy about this [border security], no matter what their political persuasion.\"\n\nBut for others, Trump's border security drive brings mixed feelings.\n\nMany local conservatives are sympathetic to the plight of migrants. Other locals, vehemently opposed to Trump, say they understand the need for stronger border protections and recognise the important role that federal officers play in their communities.\n\n\"We absolutely live in the grey area here,\" said Marisa Limon Garza, the executive director of the Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, an El Paso non-profit that provides free and low-cost legal services to immigrants and refugees.\n\nAccording to Ms Garza, the prospect of long-time residents being removed from the country is particularly galling to border residents, many of whom have family on both sides of the border or come from immigrant families that came to the US generations ago.\n\nWhile Trump and other officials have repeatedly said that immigration officials are going after \"the worst of the worst\", data shows that is not the case.\n\nThe Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse - which tracks immigration data - found that just over 70% of the nearly 60,000 people held at the end of September had no criminal record. Many have been in the country for years.\n\n\"Now what we know to be true is that some people are waking up and realising they got scammed,\" said Ms Garza, referring to locals who voted for Trump.\n\n\"Realising that they screwed their families, their loved ones, and their neighbors… and now have to wrestle with that.\"\n\nRoss Barrera, a 29-year-veteran of the US Army and a Republican who lives in Rio Grande City, told the BBC that most people in his small border community are broadly in favour of strong border security, given that legal travel and commerce across close-knit US and Mexican towns continues unabated.\n\nBut Mr Barrera added that images of harsh immigration enforcement raids across the US \"upset a lot of people\" and have caused friction.\n\n\"That upsets me too,\" he said. \"People are human. It bothers people that the lady who's been here 20 years is getting deported, or the dad who's been here 40 years is getting deported.\"\n\nOthers are more blunt.\n\n\"There's a lot of people that are having second thoughts about the way they voted,\" said Jesse Fuentes, an activist in Eagle Pass, another town that found itself in the middle of America's border battle in mid-2023.\n\n\"But people are afraid to say or do anything.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:52:35.841+00:00","title":"When will the US government shutdown end - and why did it happen?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US government shutdown, the longest in modern history, began on October 1, 2025, after Congress failed to pass a budget extension.

2025-11-10T11:52:35.841+00:00\n\nTitle: When will the US government shutdown end - and why did it happen?\n\nA deal aimed at ending the US government shutdown has passed the Senate, raising hopes that the budget stand-off between Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress could be coming to an end.\n\nThe ongoing shutdown  is the longest on record . Until it is officially over, many - but not all - US government services are   temporarily suspended, and around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay.\n\nAlthough budget confrontations are common in US politics, this one has been especially tense because President Donald Trump began drastically reducing the size of the national government as soon as he returned to office in January, and has threatened to use the current impasse to make further cuts.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats  could not agree to pass a bill funding government services past 1 October , when the previous federal budget expired.\n\nIn the US system, Congress must approve a spending plan to send to the president to be signed into law.\n\nRepublicans currently control both chambers of Congress. But in the Senate - or upper chamber - they are short of the 60 votes needed to pass the spending bill, which gives opposition Democrats some negotiating power.\n\nDemocrats wanted the bill to include an extension of expiring tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans and a reversal of Trump's cuts to Medicaid, a government healthcare programme used by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income people. They also opposed spending cuts to government health agencies.\n\nA stopgap bill designed to avoid the shutdown was passed in the House, or lower chamber, but did not clear the Senate. And so on 1 October, the US government shut down for the first time in nearly seven years.\n\nOn 5 November, the stoppage entered its 36th day, eclipsing the 35-day shutdown which happened during Trump's first presidential term in 2018/2019.\n\nEnding the shutdown requires the two parties in the Senate to find a compromise that Trump will sign, which they spent weeks failing to do.\n\nA deal aimed at ending the shutdown  finally passed the Senate on 9 November , paving the way for the record-breaking impasse to come to an end.\n\nIt followed a weekend of negotiations in Washington, after which a minority of Democrats joined with Republicans and voted in favour of an agreement.\n\nRepublicans - who hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate - needed the measure to clear a 60-vote minimum threshold.\n\nThe vote is only a procedural first step, meaning that there is no date set for the reopening of the government.\n\nThe deal will need to clear several more hurdles - including a vote from the House of Representatives - before federal employees and services return. But it was viewed as the first serious sign of progress after 40 days of deadlock.\n\nThe deal includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending healthcare subsidies that are due to expire this year - a key issue Democrats had been holding out for concessions on.\n\nBut the compromise legislation only funds most government operations until the end of January 2026 – at which point, Congress might find itself back where it was when government funding ran out at the end of September.\n\nNot all aspects of government   stop during a shutdown. Services   deemed essential continue as normal, but most staff are not paid until the government reopens.\n\nBorder protection and law enforcement staff, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and in-hospital medical care workers are expected to operate as usual.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare cheques are still being distributed, although benefit verification and card issuance work may be interrupted.\n\nMail is still being delivered and post offices are open because the US Postal Service does not depend on Congress for funding.\n\nMembers of Congress are still being paid, a convention that has been criticised by some politicians.\n\nOn the other hand, many flights have been cancelled or delayed because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are also expected to work without pay.\n\nThe Transportation Department  has announced the cancellation of thousands of flights at 40 airports across the country , citing controller fatigue. The air traffic reduction is expected reach 10% of all domestic flights and has already led to chaos and panic at airports for many travellers ahead of the busy Thanksgiving travel season.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of government employees deemed non-essential have been furloughed - temporarily put on unpaid leave.\n\nUS troops were on track to not be paid in mid-October  until the Trump administration identified funds to pay them . However, House Speaker Mike Johnson warned this was a \"temporary fix\" and future payments may not be made.\n\nMoney for Snap (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), commonly known as \"food stamps\", has also run out and been subject to a legal battle. Some 41 million Americans are enrolled in this scheme.\n\nThe deal passed in the US Senate on 9 November, which still has some hurdles to clear, would guarantee funding for the programme until September 2026.\n\nServices like federally funded pre-schools and institutions like the Smithsonian museums have been reduced or closed.\n\nSome major national parks and monuments across the country have closed,   including Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay Area and the interior of the Washington Monument.\n\nIn the past, lengthy government shutdowns were seen as politically dangerous to lawmakers and the current occupant of the White House, as they disrupted voters' everyday lives.\n\nHowever, this time, the White House has appeared more than happy to shutter large parts of the US government for an extended period. Trump has threatened to break with the past practice of returning government operations to normal, bringing spending back to previous levels, and paying workers retroactively for the shutdown.\n\nSince January, his administration has already slashed government spending and sacked many federal workers, testing the boundaries of presidential power. He has sought to permanently fire \"non-essential\" workers during the shutdown.\n\n\"We'll be laying off a lot of people,\" Trump said on 30 September, the day before the shutdown began.\n\nEarlier in October,  the administration's attempt to lay off about 4,000 workers  was temporarily blocked by a federal judge, but the White House is appealing against the ruling.\n\nThe administration has also warned that furloughed \"non-essential\" workers may not receive their unpaid salary after the shutdown finishes.\n\nBut the deal passed in the US Senate on 9 November - which must still clear the House of Representatives and receive Trump's signature - would guarantee that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown.\n\nThe impact of government shutdowns on the economy is typically limited and temporary - similar to the disruption caused by a hurricane or major storm.\n\nBut it still causes problems. Approvals for loans and permits are delayed, as are reviews of potential stock listings.\n\nBy one estimate, $800m (£614m) in new federal contracts are not being awarded each day. Unlike government employees, contractors do not receive back pay once the shutdown ends, and many of the companies are small businesses without other big clients.\n\nOverall, analysts estimate this shutdown will knock roughly 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points off economic growth for each week that it continues - about $15bn a week.\n\nBut those losses threaten to become more substantial - and harder to make up - the longer the shutdown lasts.  Analysts are worried the shutdown could hurt shopping and spending during the key holiday months of November and December.\n\nThere are also new possible economic factors in this shutdown, as Trump moves to fire workers or deny them backpay and cancels federally funded projects - all of which could extend or deepen any hit to the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, the suspension of key releases of economic data, like the monthly jobs report, has added to uncertainty. Without basic information about how the country is faring, policymakers could be at risk of committing grave errors.\n\nShutdowns over budgets  are a unique aspect of US politics .\n\nThey have become quite common over the past 50 years - with three taking place during Trump's first presidential term.\n\nThe last shutdown, which began in late December 2018, was brought about by disagreements over funding a wall on the Mexico border.\n\nIt finally ended in part because large numbers of air traffic controllers, who had been working for a month without pay, began calling in sick, as has started to happen during the current shutdown.\n\nAt the time, flight disruption quickly spread, and the shutdown came to an end shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  estimated that the 2018-2019 shutdown reduced economic output  by about $11bn, including $3bn that it never regained.\n\nBut shutdowns pre-date Trump.\n\nThe Republican Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his presidency in the 1980s - though all were relatively brief.\n\nFormer Democrat President Bill Clinton had a 21-day shutdown in 1995, while his fellow Democrat Barack Obama had a 16-day shutdown in 2013.\n\nDo you have questions about the US government shutdown?

Turkey\n\nOn the banks of the Amazon River delta, business and government officials, campaigners and lobbyists are holed up in meeting rooms in an effort to come up with ideas and action-plans to prevent an impending climate crisis.\n\nEvery delegation has its interests, and negotiations at UN climate talks are all about compromise. Which is a problem Australia knows all too well as it engages in parallel negotiations of its own in Belém.\n\nFor some time now, there's been a deadlock between Australia and Turkey over who will host next year's meeting – and it all needs to be ironed out by the end of next week when the talks come to a close. If no agreement between the two is reached, hosting will default to the German city of Bonn, where the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is headquartered.\n\nBrazil would have preferred the matter be sorted out much sooner, mindful that the quiet chatter in COP corridors about the next presidency will soon become deafening, with neither side backing down.\n\nBack in 2022, Australia put together a convincing proposition of co-hosting COP31 with the Pacific.\n\nA year after focusing on rainforests in Brazil, the oceans would be in the spotlight. Rising sea levels  are a constant talking point , and Pacific islanders have the most to lose.\n\nFiji held the presidency in 2017 but the talks themselves took place in Bonn – 2026 would be a chance for the world to see first-hand the effects of climate change.\n\nFor Australia, showing commitment to its neighbours was good domestic politics.\n\n\"Having it close to your home means you can create space for the greatest ambition,\" says Shiva Gounden of Greenpeace Australia Pacific. \"The Pacific has always led in trying to come up with ambition that really addresses the climate crisis.\"\n\nBut it was also good geopolitics, putting on a united front with the Pacific, a region where Chinese influence is growing. Australia's position would be strengthened, the Pacific would be put on the map. It felt like a win-win.\n\nHow times change. Now, Australia's bid to co-host COP with the Pacific looks like it's faltering. And possibly failing.\n\nAustralia has long maintained it has overwhelming support to host next year's summit.\n\nIn fact, more than two years ago, in my conversations with diplomatic sources, there was an extremely confident prediction that this was Australia's bid to lose. It was just a question of coming to a deal with Turkey, but the belief was that that wouldn't be an insurmountable problem.\n\nRecently several options have been floated, including reportedly splitting the hosting rights with Ankara.\n\n\"There was a fair bit of complacency early on in the process,\" says Gavan McFadzean of the Australian Conservation Foundation, who is currently in Belém. \"[There was] an assumption that an Australian/Pacific joint presidential bid would just sail through.\"\n\nBut Turkey is not budging on its desire to host. While that's not Australia's fault, many feel more could have been done to push Australia's credentials as a climate leader.\n\nAt the COP leaders' meeting last week, several dozen leaders attended including the UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. President Erdogan of Turkey didn't show up; neither did Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. It's not a strong signal of Australia's commitment.\n\nSpeaking to the ABC last week, the president of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr, who has been one of the biggest Pacific voices when it comes to climate change, said it was \"crunch time\", arguing that Albanese's presence could hopefully \"push Turkiye over the line.\"\n\nHosting COP was an election promise by Albanese, but it's not a universally popular political move.\n\nWhile the expense of bringing COP here is often cited by critics - recent reports put it at A$1bn ($650m; 500m pounds) -  supporters of hosting COP talk about the investment and tourism it will bring to Australia, especially Adelaide where it would be hosted.\n\nBut there's also a lot to lose for Australia more broadly.\n\nThere's been a fair bit of criticism over UN climate talks in recent years. Last year, in Azerbaijan, the president said that natural gas was \"a gift from God\". The year before that, the talks were hosted in Dubai – a city in one of the richest oil states in the world.\n\nTurkey, if it wins, has close ties with the Russia and Saudi Arabia, both countries who have frustrated past efforts to move forward on climate action.\n\nSo there was a view that Australia could help turn around the COP brand. The idea being that Australia is one of the \"good ones\", committed to bringing down emissions and working multilaterally to reach UN goals.\n\nOnly there's a big flaw in that argument - Australia is the largest exporter of coal in the world and one of the biggest natural gas exporters. Australia has one of the highest per capita emissions globally.\n\nWhile Albanese has made strong commitments to tackle climate change - his government recently committed to bringing down emissions in 2035 to between 60 and 72% of 2005 levels - his administration has also recently  extended the North West Shelf , one of Australia's largest gas projects.\n\nIt's trying to embrace the transition to renewables but knows that its loyalties - and its wealth -  lie in fossil fuel exports.\n\nThe minister for climate change and energy, Chris Bowen, has been a huge champion of Australia co-hosting COP. But several sources have told me that Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong have been less than enthusiastic about the prospect.\n\nDoes Australia want to come under such scrutiny? Perhaps not everyone in the government will be upset if it can't pull off the bid."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crex1zp3213o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"06:06:14.738+00:00","title":"Fear among Syria's minorities after the fall of Assad","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the fall of Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s religious minorities — particularly Alawites and Christians — are facing a surge in targeted violence, including revenge attacks and sectarian killings.

2025-11-10T06:06:14.738+00:00\n\nTitle: Fear among Syria's minorities after the fall of Assad\n\nThe killer came by night – a masked man on a motorbike who struck without warning and then sped away. It's become a familiar pattern in some corners of the new Syria in recent months, as the country's fragile unity is eroded by revenge attacks and sectarian killings.\n\nThe main targets are Alawites, the sect of the ousted Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad. But this time, on 1 October, the victims were Christians – Wissam and Shafiq Mansour, cousins who were both 39, and were as close as brothers. As they chatted with a friend over coffee and cigarettes, they were hit by a hail of bullets.\n\nThe killings happened in the village of Anaz in Wadi al-Nasara, or the Valley of the Christians – an area of rolling hills in rural Homs province in western Syria. Locals say the gunman came from the direction of a nearby Sunni Muslim village.\n\nSitting a short distance from Wissam's coffin, his father George, railed against the authorities, saying Christians in the valley had been left defenceless.\n\n\"Guns were taken from us but left in the hands of a rival (Sunni) village,\" he said. \"We want to carry arms against them. They don't know anything about religion or love or peace. Today it's Wissam, tomorrow it could be anyone.\"\n\nMany in the valley are feeling vulnerable these days. Before the regime fell, they backed Assad, and he backed them. Many Christian communities looked to him for protection. Wissam was part of a pro-Assad militia, defending his village. Some locals say that's why he was targeted.\n\nWas it a revenge attack, or a sectarian killing? We can't be sure, but nothing will bring Wissam back to his wife Leen. She bent over his coffin for a last goodbye, then slumped back, ashen-faced.\n\nHer husband and his cousin were taken for burial – their white coffins carried by black-clad mourners through streets brimming with grief. The crowd chanted \"Christian blood is precious\" as they passed the scene of the attack.\n\nThe community here is bound together by faith, and by fear that Syria's new Islamist leadership – which overthrew Assad in December last year - may not protect them.\n\nThe lone survivor of the attack doesn't intend to wait to find out. He was shot in the hand and broke his ankle making his getaway. He doesn't want to be named.\n\nAfter the fall of the regime, the 36-year-old had come back to Syria, from Lebanon, with high hopes.\n\n\"We all came back home,\" he said, \"wanting to start new businesses. But what we were promised about security, and a future for Syria, we do not see it. My dearest friends are dead. I will have to leave the country again. There are many extremist groups. I don't know where Syria is going.\"\n\nLess than an hour's drive away, in the city of Homs, there are almost daily reports of kidnappings and drive by shootings. We found a pattern of deadly attacks on Alawites, killings that happen quietly, and attract little response.\n\nThe city has plenty of battle scars; some of its bustling streets are lined with ruins and rubble. Having survived the war, some Alawites now wonder if they will survive the peace.\n\nDuring the Assad era, belonging to this sect – an offshoot of Shia Islam - could bring benefits.\n\nNow it's a curse, and for Shaaban Al Ezzeldin, 46, it was a death sentence.\n\nThe shopkeeper was shot three times on 28 September as he locked up the family business at night. Once again, the killer was a masked man, on a motorbike.\n\nWe meet his brother Adnan in a building owned by their family since 1970. He is bearded, wearing black, and weighed down by grief. Unlike many, he dares to speak out.\n\n\"People are being killed just because they are Alawites,\" he told me, \"no more, no less. My brother was loved by everyone in the area, by all our neighbours, by all sects. Some of our neighbours used to come to the shop and enjoy evenings with him. He never bothered or harmed anyone.\"\n\nHe says Shaaban used to sit and chat with security forces at a checkpoint right outside the shop. After the checkpoint was removed, he was shot dead.\n\nI asked why he thinks the checkpoint was taken away. He says he does not know and stresses the family are \"not accusing anyone\".\n\nAdnan says two other Alawites were killed on the same day as his brother, adding that the bloodletting has a purpose. \"What's happening right now is the seed for forced emigration,\" he says. \"It's just the beginning. Someone is trying to destabilise the situation, and oppose co-existence, though we have been living together for hundreds of years.\"\n\nHe hopes Syria's mosaic of religions and sects can hold together. But then he adds: \"I lost my brother, and others lost their loved ones too. If we are all going to get killed, it's better we flee.\"\n\nSyria's interim government has promised to protect all its citizens, not just the majority population of Sunni Muslims. The country's Justice Minister, Mazhar al-Wais, says there will be public trials for those accused of involvement in large scale sectarian violence earlier this year.\n\nMore than 1,400 people were killed in March when government forces and allied groups were accused of carrying out summary executions, after an attack by Assad loyalists. Most of the victims were Alawite civilians.\n\nAbout 2,000 people - combatants and civilians — were killed in July in another outbreak of sectarian violence. Here too government forces were accused of executions. Most of the dead were from the Druze minority.\n\nThe scale of the recent killings is hard to assess. The attacks are usually isolated and often shrouded in silence. Many families are afraid to talk.\n\nBy cross checking information from local media reports, contacts on the ground and human rights groups, we estimate that at least 40 Alawites were killed in Homs in separate attacks between 5 June and 31 October. The dead included a student, a farmer, a taxi driver, a teacher killed in a grenade attack on a school bus, and another shot dead in front of her class.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) says there are escalating incidents of murder and kidnapping in Homs province, with Alawite-majority areas the most affected. Most attacks are acts of revenge, it says, against former members of the regime, or those suspected of collaborating.\n\nAlawites account for about 10% of Syria's population, but under Assad – the father and the son – they filled many roles in the military, security and intelligence agencies.\n\nWhether they supported the regime or not - and not all of them did – Alawites are now at risk.\n\nIn a modest home in a mixed neighbourhood of Homs, a pink-walled bedroom has become a shrine. A copy of the Quran rests on a pillow. School books and letters from friends are piled on a desk. This is where a mother – who does not want to be named - comes to be close to her beloved daughter. \"Her soul is still hanging over the place,\" she says. \"Her friends come every few days. No one fully grasps the idea that she is now dead.\"\n\nGhina, 14, was on the balcony of her home on 19 August when a gunman on a motorbike drove past and opened fire. She died in her mother's arms, surrounded by neighbours who had come to celebrate her exam results.\n\nGhina was \"the best of daughters\" her mother says, \"so smart, so good at school, addicted to studying, with so many plans.\" The teenager loved basketball, and wanted to travel and to study law.\n\nHer younger brothers no longer go to school. Their mother is too frightened to let them.\n\n\"Alawite families started leaving the area, they sell their houses and go. We thought it would get better (after the fall of Assad). They said it was liberation; people would live freely. Now we fear everything. We are scared when we hear a motorbike.\"\n\nGhina's face stares out from a large photo, her warm smile framed by long dark hair. \"She was smiling since the day she was born,\" her mother says. \"She loved life so much.\"\n\nHer mother does not speculate on who killed her. \"There are harmful people around,\" she says, \"they sow seeds of sedition. Probably they are not connected with the authorities or the state. I really don't know.\"\n\nBut she is sure of one thing – why her family was targeted. Was it because you are Alawite, I ask?\n\n\"Yes\", she replies, without hesitation.\n\nOn the same day we met Ghina's mother, another Alawite family were burying a loved one who had been abducted and killed. When we visited their home, they received us politely but were too frightened to speak.\n\nNo one has been charged with Ghina's killing. The killings in the Valley of the Christians are also unsolved.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lana Antaki, Wietske Burema, Goktay Koraltan and Aref Alkrez."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/politics/senators-democrat-shutdown-vote.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:48:42.141Z","title":"8 Senators Break Ranks With Democrats and Advance G.O.P.

Ranks With Democrats and Advance G.O.P. Plan to End Shutdown\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T16:48:42.141Z\n\nEight senators in the Democratic caucus broke with the party late Sunday to vote with Republicans and advance legislation to end the government shutdown.\n\nThe compromise measure that passed by a 60-to-40 vote came with a pledge from Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, to allow a vote in December on the Democrats’ main demand: extending health care subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year.\n\nBut many Democrats have said for weeks that such a promise would be insufficient to win their votes to reopen the government, because it was unlikely to pass in the Republican-led Congress. If the subsidies expire, it would significantly increase insurance premiums for millions of Americans.\n\nThree of the eight senators — Angus King of Maine, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada — have supported a Republican-written stopgap bill to fund the government since the shutdown began. On Sunday, five others joined them, paving the way for the spending measure to advance toward a full vote in the Senate. That drew anger and outrage from many of their Democratic colleagues who said the party should have held firm to protect the health care subsidies.\n\nThe compromise still needs to win approval in the Senate, pass the G.O.P.-controlled House and be signed by President Trump to bring the shutdown to an end.\n\nHere are the eight senators — none of whom face re-election in 2026, and two of whom are retiring at the end of their terms — who broke ranks:\n\nSenator Angus King of Maine: An independent who caucuses with Democrats, Mr. King was one of the lead negotiators of the deal. He said many “people are being hurt” by the shutdown, and that pain had pushed his colleagues to support a deal that would reopen the government without extending Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n\nSenator Tim Kaine of Virginia: Mr. Kaine said on Sunday evening that he was backing the deal after securing a provision in the temporary spending bill to reverse layoffs made during the shutdown and ensure that furloughed workers would receive back pay.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin of Illinois: The No. 2 Senate Democrat, who is retiring at the end of his term, Mr. Durbin underlined that the legislation advanced on Sunday night was different from the one voted down by Democrats 14 times over the course of the shutdown because it included the provision to reverse layoffs. “This bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown’s hurt,” Mr. Durbin said in a statement.\n\nSenator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania: For the 15th time, Mr. Fetterman voted with Republicans to end the shutdown. In a post on social media, he called himself “a consistent voice against shutting our government down,” and apologized to members of the military, food stamp recipients, government workers and Capitol Police officers “who haven’t been paid in weeks.”\n\nSenator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire: Ms. Hassan said in a statement that now was the time for Republicans to engage in “serious, bipartisan negotiations” to extend the expiring health insurance subsidies.\n\nSenator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire: Ms. Shaheen, who is retiring at the end of her term, said at a news conference that the legislation “is our best path” toward reopening the government and extending the health care tax credits.\n\nSenator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada: Ms. Cortez Masto said in a statement that while the government must extend the expiring health insurance subsidies, “that can’t come at the expense of the millions of Americans across our country impacted by a shutdown.”\n\nSenator Jacky Rosen of Nevada: Ms. Rosen defended her vote in a statement, while accusing Republicans of “weaponizing their power in alarming ways” during the shutdown. She cited the withholding of food stamp benefits and reductions in air travel.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/politics/supreme-court-mail-ballots-mississippi.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:47:18-05:00","title":"Supreme Court to Hear Major Challenge to Mail-In Ballot Laws","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a major legal challenge, Watson v.

‘Affordability’ Message\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T11:47:20-05:00\n\nOn the campaign trail, President Trump couldn’t talk about affordability enough. He vowed that should he retake the White House, he would tackle it on many fronts.\n\n“We will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,” he proclaimed at a campaign rally in Asheville, N.C., last year.\n\n“From today, and from the day I take the oath of office,” he added, “we will rapidly drive prices down and make America affordable again.”\n\nOver the past week, he could barely stand to hear the word.\n\nSince Democratic victories in elections last week on platforms that focused on bringing down the cost of living, Mr. Trump has angrily confronted the reality that he has lost ground on an issue that helped deliver him a second term.\n\nIn social media rants and in misleading claims about the economy, Mr. Trump and his cabinet have tried to wrest back a message of affordability that has buoyed Democrats and is resonating with an American electorate that is souring on his economic agenda.\n\nIn the days after the elections this month, the president struggled to craft a coherent and consistent message on the issue. He called affordability a “new word” and said that Republicans had not talked enough about it. He then blasted it as “con job” by Democrats. Eventually he declared, “I don’t want to hear about the affordability.”\n\nBy the end of the week, Mr. Trump was so perturbed by questions about the topic that he lashed out at a reporter and stopped a news conference with the Hungarian prime minister to have his press secretary come in and defend his record.\n\n“The reason I don’t want to talk about affordability — everybody knows it is far less expensive under Trump than it was under sleepy Joe Biden,” he said.\n\nBut in reality, Mr. Trump has mentioned the word affordability as much in the last week as he has in the past nine months. His renewed attention to the issue comes after weeks in which he faced mounting criticism for appearing out of touch with everyday Americans.\n\nThe week before the election, Mr. Trump was on a trip to Asia, showcasing his ability to broker trade and peace deals abroad, while thousands of federal workers missed paychecks and millions of low-income Americans were scheduled to lose food benefits. When he returned, he attended a lavish “Great Gatsby”-themed party at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nOn social media, Mr. Trump posted incessantly about the new Lincoln bathroom, remodeled in black and white marble with gold faucets and light fixtures, and on renovations at the Kennedy Center, which he said would be outfitted in marble and “magnificent high end carpeting.”\n\nThe posts provided fodder for Mr. Trump’s opponents, especially congressional Democrats, who for the past six weeks withheld their votes to reopen the government, seeking to prevent health care costs from skyrocketing for some Americans on the federal marketplace.\n\nEven as the Senate moved toward ending the shutdown without an agreement to extend expiring health insurance subsidies, many Democrats were vowing to make the cost of health insurance a defining issue in the midterm elections next year. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said on Sunday night that he would oppose the deal to reopen the government because it “still leaves millions of Americans wondering how they are going to pay for their health care or whether they will be able to afford to get sick.”\n\nAs Mr. Trump sought to recalibrate his economic messaging after the election, he claimed there was “no inflation,” that gas prices were almost at $2 and grocery prices were “way down.” To illustrate the point, he repeatedly pointed to a report from Walmart showing that the cost of a Thanksgiving meal would be 25 percent less than under President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n“2025 Thanksgiving dinner under Trump is 25% lower than 2024 Thanksgiving dinner under Biden, according to Walmart,” Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Thursday. “My cost are lower than the Democrats on everything, especially oil and gas! So the Democrats ‘affordability’ issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!”\n\nMr. Trump risks being in a similar position as his predecessor, defending his record by pointing to statistics that don’t capture a troubling reality that many Americans are feeling.\n\nThe latest government data shows that inflation persists, even ticking up slightly in the most recent consumer report. Grocery prices have risen since he took office. Experts are mixed on whether Mr. Trump’s policies have led to a drop in gas prices, which hover around $3 a gallon. And the Thanksgiving meal cost that Mr. Trump has cited come with a caveat: There are fewer items in this year’s Walmart bundle, analyses have shown.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that a majority of Americans say they are spending more on groceries and utilities than they were a year ago, and many blame Mr. Trump. A recent NBC News poll found that only 30 percent of voters believe that Mr. Trump has lived up to their expectations for tackling inflation and the cost of living.\n\nEven some MAGA supporters acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s insistence that the cost of living was coming down didn’t add up.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Georgia Republican who has grown disillusioned with her party and Mr. Trump on some issues, challenged the president’s narrative, saying in an interview on CNN that “affordability is a problem.”\n\n“I go to the grocery store myself,” she said. “Grocery prices remain high. Energy prices are high. My electricity bills are higher here in Washington, D.C., at my apartment, and they’re also higher at my house in Rome, Georgia — higher than they were a year ago.”\n\nThe White House continued to defend Mr. Trump’s record on Sunday, blaming Mr. Biden and the news media for the state of the economy. In a statement, a spokesman pointed to lower inflation, and cheaper eggs and Mr. Trump’s efforts to drive down prescription drug costs as evidence that the president was focused on affordability.\n\n“President Trump has been aggressively tackling Joe Biden’s inflation and affordability crisis since Day 1 of his presidency, when he signed an array of executive orders to lower energy and regulatory costs,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.\n\n“The president and administration will continue to deliver historic trade deals, investments, and economic relief for the American people — the Fake News media should try covering these initiatives and their results honestly for a change.”\n\nAnd on the television circuit, Mr. Trump’s cabinet members painted an optimistic picture of the economy when pressed about the issue of affordability.\n\n“Energy prices, gasoline prices are way down, and we are doing what we can every day,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I think we are on a very good path to bringing prices down.”\n\nKevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said Mr. Trump was making up for Mr. Biden’s failures. “So we see inflation under control, and the economy booming, but we understand 100 percent why people are still hurting, because we haven’t made up all the room that was lost under Joe Biden,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n\nBut some White House officials have acknowledged that Mr. Trump has work to do to convince the American people that he’s trying.\n\n“We need to focus on the home front,” Vice President JD Vance wrote in a social media post after last week’s elections. “The president has done a lot that has already paid off in lower interest rates and lower inflation, but we inherited a disaster from Joe Biden and Rome wasn’t built in a day. We’re going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that’s the metric by which we’ll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.”\n\nJames Blair, the White House deputy chief of staff, said in an interview with Politico last week that Mr. Trump would talk more about the cost of living in the coming months.\n\n“The president is very keyed into what’s going on, and he recognizes, like anybody, that it takes time to do an economic turnaround,” Mr. Blair said, “but all the fundamentals are there, and I think you’ll see him be very, very focused on prices and cost of living.”\n\nLindsay Owens, the executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, an economic policy group, said the affordability issue had clearly become “existential” for Mr. Trump. But she said it would take more than talking about it to convince voters.\n\n“I don’t think Americans’ attitudes toward the economy, and toward Trump’s sophistication on the economy, will change until the facts on the ground change,” Dr. Owens said. “It is his one strength that has now turned into a pretty considerable weakness, and we’re starting to see bumps in data that we haven’t seen in over 15 years.”\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump signaled that he was tuning into the growing frustrations.\n\nOn Friday night, he announced that he was directing the Justice Department to investigate whether meatpacking companies were engaging in “collusion” and driving up the prices of beef. On Saturday, he announced a proposal to reroute health care subsidies paid to insurance companies to Americans’ savings accounts. On Sunday morning he proposed doling out $2,000 dividends from tariff revenue — “(not including high income people),” he wrote.\n\nBut by Sunday afternoon, as he flew back to Washington to attend a football game after a weekend of golfing at his West Palm Beach resort, Mr. Trump’s attention was back on a project that has commanded his undivided attention.\n\n“The Main Entrance to the new Ballroom at the White House!” Mr. Trump posted on his social media account, with a picture of the progress of his newly decorated space.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/world/middleeast/syria-president-al-shara-trump-washington.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"06:54:27-05:00","title":"Syria’s President to Meet Trump at White House for First Time","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Ahmed al-Shara of Syria is set to make his first visit to the U.S. White House to meet with President Donald Trump, marking a historic moment as the first Syrian head of state to do so since the fall of the Assad regime.

Mr. al-Shara has since redefined himself as a statesman while seeking to return Syria to the international fold and rebuild the country as it emerges from a long and devastating civil war.\n\nA World Bank report estimated the cost of Syria’s reconstruction at about $216 billion.\n\nSince taking power, Mr. al-Shara has toured the wealthy Gulf states to drum up international investment. In September, he went to New York and became the first Syrian president to address the U.N.

They discussed developing Syria’s oil fields and other projects in the energy, transport and tourism sectors.\n\nBefore traveling to Washington, Mr. al-Shara joined world leaders in Brazil at an annual U.N. climate summit and invited investments in renewable energy as part of his government’s plans for reconstruction.\n\nMr. al-Shara has been embraced by Mr. Trump.\n\nIn December, the U.S. government dropped the $10 million bounty, and in July, it revoked the terrorist designation for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that Mr. al-Shara once led.\n\nMr. Trump has also pledged that Washington would lift all sanctions on Syria to support its efforts to rebuild. So far, Mr. Trump has granted Syria widespread exemptions on sanctions and pushed for Congress to repeal a 2019 law, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, which imposed the toughest sanctions on Syria.\n\nThere remains some resistance to doing so in light of concerns about Syria’s sometimes rocky transition since the Assad regime collapsed.\n\nOver the past year, there have been a series of deadly outbursts of sectarian violence, some involving armed groups that support Mr. al-Shara’s government.\n\nMr. al-Shara has also come under criticism for concentrating power in his own hands and those of a close circle of loyalists.\n\nBefore his visit to Washington, the U.N. Security Council voted on Thursday to remove Mr. al-Shara from a terrorism sanctions list, a move pushed by the United States. That step will allow him to travel more freely, without having to seek waivers for some trips.\n\nBy signing onto the coalition fighting the Islamic State, Mr. al-Shara is further bolstering his relationship with the Trump administration, analysts say.\n\nWhile the Islamic State lost its territorial foothold in Syria in 2019, it continues to have a presence in the country, and there are fears that it could re-emerge if Mr. al-Shara fails to stabilize and unite the country and consolidate his own security forces.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/world/europe/trump-bbc-lawsuit-documentary.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:18:22-05:00","title":"Trump Threatens to Sue the BBC for $1 Billion After Jan. 6 Documentary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, through his lawyer Alejandro Brito, threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over a documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?' that allegedly edited a speech he delivered on January 6, 2021, in a way that portrayed it as a call for violent action.

In that decision, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to urge reconsideration of the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which recognized gay marriage nationwide.\n\nPolls show that same-sex marriage now has broad public support. More than three dozen House Republicans helped pass legislation in 2022 that required states and the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages.\n\nMary Bonauto, the lawyer who argued the Obergefell case before the Supreme Court, praised the court’s action. “Today, millions of Americans can breathe a sigh of relief for their families, current or hoped for, because all families deserve equal rights under the law,” she said in a statement.\n\nMs. Davis became a symbol of religious opposition to same-sex marriage after the Supreme Court’s decision in 2015. She spent five nights in jail after she was found in contempt of court for defying a federal order to issue licenses to same-sex couples.\n\nDavid Ermold and David Moore, a Kentucky couple, sued Ms. Davis after they had been refused a license and prevailed at trial in 2023. Ms. Davis was ordered to pay the couple $360,000 in damages and lawyers’ fees.\n\nShe appealed the judgment, claiming First Amendment protection from liability and asserted that the court had wrongly recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage and should reverse its decision in Obergefell.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled against Ms. Davis in March, citing a recent Supreme Court decision that found public officials acting in their official capacity are not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nPublic officials cannot “wield the authority of the state to violate the constitutional rights of citizens if the official believes she is ‘follow[ing] her conscience,’” wrote Judge Helene N. White, a nominee of President George W. Bush.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge Chad Readler, a nominee of President Trump, quoted an earlier ruling that said Ms. Davis had taken “the law into her own hands.”\n\nMathew Staver, a lawyer for Ms. Davis, asserted that the Obergefell opinion was “egregiously wrong from the start” and said his organization, Liberty Counsel, would continue to work to reverse it.\n\n“It is not a matter of if, but when the Supreme Court will overturn Obergefell,” he said in a statement.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/supreme-court-dreadlocks-prisoner.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:03:28-05:00","title":"Prison Guards Shaved His Dreadlocks.

The Supreme Court Will Decide if He Can Sue.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T05:03:28-05:00\n\nDamon Landor, a Rastafarian, was so wary of Louisiana prison officials that he reported to serve a five-month sentence carrying a copy of a legal opinion that found that inmates must be allowed to keep their dreadlocks, under a federal law protecting prisoners’ religious freedom.\n\nFour months into his term for drug possession, Mr. Landor, whose faith requires him to let his hair grow long, was transferred to a new prison. When he pulled out a copy of the court’s 2017 decision, a guard threw it in the trash, according to court documents he filed in a later lawsuit.\n\nThen, two guards handcuffed Mr. Landor to a chair, restrained him and forcibly shaved his dreadlocks.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday will hear arguments in a case testing whether Mr. Landor can sue state prison officials for money for violating his religious rights.\n\nAttorney General Elizabeth B. Murrill of Louisiana, who is defending the prison officials, nevertheless strongly condemned what happened to him in prison. So, too, did lower-court judges who ruled against Mr. Landor. But the appeals court said it was bound by past rulings banning such lawsuits.\n\nThe Trump administration and Mr. Landor’s lawyers have urged the Supreme Court to allow the case to proceed.\n\nThe Supreme Court has in recent years repeatedly bolstered religious rights. In 2022, the court sided with a Texas death row inmate who wanted his pastor to touch him and pray aloud at the time of his execution. The same year, the court said a high school football coach had a constitutional right to pray at the 50-yard line after his team’s games.\n\nWhen Mr. Landor was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center in Cottonport, La., in 2020, he handed a prison guard proof of his religious accommodations — the 2017 court decision, which said that the state’s policy of cutting the hair of incarcerated Rastafarians violated federal protections for religious exercise. At that point, he had not cut his hair for almost two decades and his dreadlocks fell nearly to his knees.\n\nMr. Landor, who is now growing his hair back and plans to be in the courtroom on Monday, has said his dreadlocks are central to his identity and religion.\n\n“When I was strapped down and shaved, it felt like I was raped,” Mr. Landor said in a statement last year. “And the guards, they just didn’t care. They will treat you any kind of way. They knew better than to cut my hair, but they did it anyway.”\n\nHe sued the warden and the guards under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, a federal law that requires states to protect the religious rights of individuals in state institutions.\n\nIn a separate case, the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that a related statute from 1993 — the Religious Freedom Restoration Act — permitted individuals to sue to “obtain money damages against federal officials in their individual capacities.”\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote in that case, Tanzin v. Tanvir, that “in the context of suits against government officials, damages have long been awarded as appropriate relief.”\n\nMr. Landor’s lawyers, led by Zachary D. Tripp, told the Supreme Court that the language in the two statutes was identical and allowed for the same monetary remedies.\n\nBesides, he wrote, the “‘stark and egregious’ facts here viscerally show that damages are essential” to protect religious liberty. Congress did not enact the law, he added, so state officials “could freely ignore it.”\n\nLouisiana’s lawyers told the Supreme Court that Mr. Landor could not “copy-and-paste” the rationale from the court’s 2020 decision involving federal officials to find a right to sue state officials for damages.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the same court that had ruled that the law protected Rastafarian prisoners’ dreadlocks, said it “emphatically” condemned Mr. Landor’s treatment. But the judges said they were bound by past precedent that did not allow such litigation against state officials. The statute Mr. Landor relied on was meaningfully different, the panel wrote, and did not authorize his lawsuit.\n\n“The same words, placed in different contexts, sometimes mean different things,’” a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit said, quoting an earlier Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe full 5th Circuit declined to rehear the case, but nine judges asked the Supreme Court to provide direction to the lower courts.\n\nJudge Edith Brown Clement wrote that Mr. Landor “clearly suffered a grave legal wrong.” Prison officials, she wrote, “knowingly violated Damon Landor’s rights in a stark and egregious manner, literally throwing in the trash our opinion holding that Louisiana’s policy of cutting Rastafarians’ hair violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act before pinning Landor down and shaving his head.”\n\nBut whether he can sue prison officials for money, Judge Clement added, “is a question only the Supreme Court can answer.”\n\nAdam Liptak contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-reactions.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"18:49:35-05:00","title":"Marriage Ruling Relieves Gay Americans and Leaves Conservatives Pledging New Challenges","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court denied a request to reconsider the 2015 Obergefell v.

Conservative groups and state lawmakers said they were disappointed that the court was not taking up the issue now, but would continue to press legal challenges.\n\nBefore the denial, legal experts had speculated that the court was unlikely to reconsider the issue at this juncture. But the stakes were so high for families and same-sex couples, advocates of same-sex marriage said, that many people were on tenterhooks waiting for a decision.\n\nThe petition had come from Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the landmark decision in 2015, Obergefell v. Hodges. If the Supreme Court were to overturn Obergefell, many state laws that prohibit same-sex couples from marrying would snap back into effect. Congress enacted a federal statute in 2022 mandating that marriages performed by states be given recognition by the federal government, but that statute does not guarantee a right to marry.\n\n“Do I think it’s a pure victory and we have nothing to worry about?” Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the original case, said on Monday. “No, but I am taking the win today. Everyone across the country who believes that we deserve the right to marry the person we love, whoever we call home, we’re all breathing a bit easier.”\n\nThe number of married same-sex couples in the United States doubled in the last decade to 774,000, according to government data.\n\nThe possibility of a reversal on Obergefell led some same-sex couples to speed up their marriage plans, advocates said, and added fuel to state campaigns to repeal old statutes and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex marriage. In Virginia, L.G.B.T.Q. advocates are hoping legislators will approve a state constitutional amendment in 2026 enshrining a right to marry, regardless of race, sex and gender.\n\n“Today’s news is a relief, but we must always remain vigilant,” said Narissa Rahaman, executive director of Equality Virginia, a group that supports same-sex marriage.\n\nA Gallup survey from May of this year found that support by Republicans for same-sex marriage had dropped to 41 percent from 55 percent in 2021. The Southern Baptist Convention, which is often seen as a strong indicator of conservative evangelical opinion, voted overwhelmingly earlier this year to call on the Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell.\n\nAnd in half a dozen state legislatures across the country this year, Republican lawmakers have introduced resolutions urging the Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell.\n\nThe sponsor of one such measure, Representative Heather Scott, Republican of Idaho, said on Monday that she was undeterred by the Supreme Court’s refusal to take up the issue this year.\n\n“I’ll try to rerun it next year,” Ms. Scott said. “We need to continue to put pressure for them to override. Our constitution is very clear: we will only recognize marriage between a man and a woman. So this Supreme Court ruling is overriding our state constitution.”\n\nLegal advocates of same-sex marriage said that the prospect of the court revisiting the issue served as a reminder that a right to same-sex marriage could not be taken for granted, even at a time when the first generation of married same-sex couples are, in some cases, starting to raise grandchildren.\n\nThere is no other clear case in the pipeline, legal experts said, for a direct challenge to Obergefell.\n\n“It’s important to continue to make people aware of how important those family protections are for so many people,” said Jennifer Levi, a lawyer who worked on some of the nation’s first cases, in Massachusetts and Connecticut, on the right to same-sex marriage. “We have certainly seen the court shift its position in other contexts.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/climate/cop30-belem-climate-energy-technology-china.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:15:55-05:00","title":"A Flood of Green Tech From China Is Upending Global Climate Politics","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China is emerging as a global renewable energy superpower, exporting solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries to developing nations and investing in green manufacturing facilities abroad.

Poorer countries like Ethiopia and Nepal are leapfrogging over gasoline-burning cars to battery-powered ones. Nigeria, a petrostate, plans to build its first solar-panel manufacturing plant. Morocco is creating a battery hub to supply European automakers. Santiago, the capital of Chile, has electrified more than half of its bus fleet in recent years.\n\nKey to this shift is the world’s new renewable energy superpower: China.\n\nHaving saturated its own market with solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, Chinese companies are now exporting their wares to energy-hungry countries in the developing world. What’s more, they’re investing billions of dollars in factories that make things like solar panels in Vietnam and electric cars in Brazil.\n\nIn effect, Chinese industrial policy is shaping the development trajectory of some of the world’s fastest-growing economies.\n\n“From a climate point of view, the developing countries are showing solutions,” said André Corrêa do Lago, the Brazilian diplomat shepherding this year’s international climate talks, known as COP30, in the Brazilian city of Belém.\n\n“I think that emerging countries are appearing in this COP with a different role,” he added.\n\nIs that completely fixing the problem of climate change? No. Most countries, including these big, growing economies, still get the majority of their energy from fossil fuels. Indonesia is still mining vast amounts of coal, the dirtiest energy source. India and China continue their coal-plant building spree. Brazil plans to expand oil production.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Decades\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T19:02:41-05:00\n\nIt is tempting to view the sudden resignation of two top BBC executives on Sunday evening, in the wake of scathing criticism by the Trump administration, as an extraterritorial example of the intense pressure that President Trump has put on broadcast news organizations in the United States.\n\nBut the British Broadcasting Corporation is not CBS or ABC, both of which settled lawsuits brought by Mr. Trump over their coverage of him. Its current crisis — the gravest the BBC has faced in decades — is less about Mr. Trump, experts said, than about the insoluble tensions of a renowned public service broadcaster operating in a bitterly divided political and media world.\n\nVilified by political enemies, who accuse it of chronic bias — in this case, to the left — and targeted by rival media firms, who resent its public funding, the BBC is a perennial football in Britain’s political contests. With its global reach, it regularly runs afoul of foreign governments as well, from India to the United States.\n\nThe BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, attributed their resignations in part to the tempest over a misleadingly edited documentary about Mr. Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol. Their exits, however, followed a string of disputes over the BBC’s coverage of other sensitive issues, ranging from the war in Gaza to transgender rights.\n\n“It’s a critical time for the BBC to be impartial because there’s not much impartiality in the world,” said Howard Stringer, a former president of CBS News who once served on the BBC’s board. “They clearly felt that taking on Trump was important, but in this case, it gave Trump an opening and it left Tim Davie exposed.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

What has been less discussed is the fallout of having so many members of Congress who are at (and well beyond) retirement age.\n\nAnd as liberal voters just found out, it’s a lot easier to vote for something your base hates if you’re too old to worry about re-election.\n\nOf the Democratic-aligned senators who voted for the shutdown deal, two are not running again: Dick Durbin of Illinois, 80, and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, 78. Angus King of Maine is 81 and Jacky Rosen of Nevada is 68. Both Tim Kaine of Virginia and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire are 67.\n\nAll would be past 70 years old if they decide to run again when their terms end.\n\nThe other “yes” votes were from Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, 61, who represents a state where the Las Vegas tourism industry feared taking a major hit from canceled flights, and from John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who is just 56 but has already alienated much of his party by embracing Trump on a slew of issues.\n\n“This is the problem with the gerontocracy,” said Amanda Litman, the leader of Run for Something, a group that recruits young progressive candidates to run for office. “When you have older leaders who are never going to face re-election again, you make decisions that are disconnected from what their voters believe.”\n\nYet the age issue is likely to keep flaring up. Senator Chuck Schumer’s top three midterm recruits are Janet Mills, 77, in Maine; Sherrod Brown, 73, in Ohio; and Roy Cooper, 68, in North Carolina. Each would be in their 80s by the end of a second term.\n\nThen there is the matter of how much to fight, and who should lead the charge.\n\n“Standing up to Donald Trump didn’t work,” King, the senator from Maine, said Monday on MSNBC. “It actually gave him more power.”\n\nThis sentiment came as news to Democrats who were less than a week removed from sweeping victories in California, New Jersey and Virginia. For many in the party, Tuesday’s elections were the first time in a year that they could feel good about their collective ability to punch back against Trump.\n\nInstead, many Democrats were surprised to see a key slice of senators backing down on the party’s 40-day demand that Republicans fund Affordable Care Act subsidies — with polls showing that voters were generally on the Democrats’ side.\n\nAnger from across the party erupted, and elected Democrats found themselves navigating new calls for Senator Chuck Schumer to be ousted as minority leader. Many progressives and younger Democrats have argued increasingly loudly that Schumer, 74, is no longer up to the fight against Trump.\n\nSenator Mark Kelly dodged questions on Monday about whether Schumer should remain as leader. Representative Ro Khanna of California suggested Schumer should go, then bickered with reporters on social media about it. And Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who is aiming for a promotion to the Senate, tried to use his opposition to Schumer as a cudgel against Senator Ed Markey, his primary opponent.\n\n“Maybe now @EdMarkey will finally join me in pledging not to vote for Schumer?” Moulton wrote online.\n\nFeeding the discontent are memories of the last shutdown fight in March, when Schumer led Senate Democrats to make a deal with Republicans to keep the government open. Then as now, the party’s base and most of its members in Congress wanted the fight against Trump and his allies, while a handful of older institutionalists demurred.\n\nIn one sign of how far out on an island the eight senators are, they drew backhanded scorn from the Democratic National Committee, which rarely intervenes in intraparty disputes.\n\n“I am proud of the majority of Senate Democrats who opposed this vote,” said Ken Martin, the party chairman.\n\nThis is all taking place as Trump issued pre-emptive pardons to Rudolph Giuliani and a host of people who tried to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nIn a world without the Democratic senators’ capitulation, the pardons might have been a galvanizing issue for the party’s elected officials to rally around while continuing to press their case that spiraling health insurance costs were Trump’s fault alone.\n\nInstead, they will keeping arguing among themselves.\n\nIn One Number\n\nThat’s the total number of people believed to have been killed in the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea by U.S. military strikes since early September. Led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the campaign to stop vessels suspected of drug smuggling has largely taken place in international waters.\n\nA wide range of legal experts have denounced the killings as illegal, while the Trump administration argues that the strikes are lawful because the president has “determined” that the country is in a formal conflict with drug cartels.\n\nThat was Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Republican congresswoman from Georgia, in a recent interview with CNN — making yet another departure from the official Republican line by questioning whether all is truly well in President Trump’s America.\n\nONE LAST THING\n\nSome supporters of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, and his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda once regarded the term “anti-vax” as a slur. But last weekend, his allies descended on Austin for a “Make America Healthy Again” conference, and announced they were changing their attitudes.\n\nMy colleague Sheryl Gay Stolberg reported from the conference, where vaccine-wary MAHA supporters marveled at the newfound power of their movement now that Kennedy holds clout in Washington. One declared a need “to be more boldly anti-vax.”\n\nAma Sarpomaa and Taylor Robinson contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/books/booker-prize-2025-david-szalay-flesh.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"19:31:01-05:00","title":"David Szalay’s ‘Flesh’ Wins 2025 Booker Prize","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Szalay’s novel 'Flesh' has won the 2025 Booker Prize, becoming the first British-Hungarian book to receive the award.

David Szalay’s novel “All That Man Is” was nominated for the 2016 Booker Prize, the author described the award ceremony as “a horrible experience.”\n\nHe sat through a “very stressful” dinner, wondering whether his book would triumph, only for it to lose to Paul Beatty’s “The Sellout.” He later told The Guardian newspaper, “Only trauma imprints memories that clearly.”\n\nOn Monday night in London, Szalay sat through another Booker Prize dinner. But this time his latest novel, “Flesh,” won the prestigious literary award.\n\nThe author Roddy Doyle, who chaired this year’s judging panel, called it a “singular” and “extraordinary” novel.\n\n“It’s just not like any other book,” Doyle told a news conference before Monday’s announcement about the novel, in which Istvan, a lonely Hungarian teenager, makes an unexpected rise to the height of British society. The sparseness of Szalay’s writing compels readers to “climb into the novel and be involved,” Doyle added.\n\nAccepting the award, Szalay said that “Flesh” wasn’t easy to write, “and I didn’t always cope that well with the pressure. I didn’t cope that wisely or graciously.”\n\nSzalay then thanked his wife for supporting him. “I’m sure she is bewildered as I am by the fact that those rather bleak times and this glittering evening are somehow part of the same process and same experience.”\n\n“Flesh” beat the five other shortlisted titles, including Susan Choi’s “Flashlight,” Kiran Desai’s “The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny,” Katie Kitamura’s “Audition,” Ben Markovits’s “The Rest of Our Lives” and Andrew Miller’s “The Land in Winter.”\n\nOne of literature’s pre-eminent awards, the Booker Prize is given each year to the book deemed to be best novel written in English and published in Britain or Ireland. Last year, Samantha Harvey triumphed with “Orbital,” a novel set aboard the International Space Station. In recent years, the Booker has acquired a global following, and winning titles often become hits on both sides of the Atlantic. As well as a boost in sales, the winning author receives a cash prize of 50,000 pounds, about $65,800.\n\n“Flesh” has attracted a host of high-profile admirers since its publication in March, including the pop star Dua Lipa, who chose the novel for her book club, and the novelist Zadie Smith, who told a BBC radio show that “Flesh” was “astonishing.” Some novelists give their characters incredibly complicated inner lives, Smith said, but Szalay had the confidence to create a lead who doesn’t reflect much on the events that befall him, and who felt realistic because of that.\n\n“Sometimes when I’m reading, one of the things I’m looking for is, ‘How has this person made the novel new?’” Smith said: “For me, this novel was new.”\n\nReviewers also praised the book, even when they had quibbles. Dwight Garner, writing in The New York Times, said that he admired “Flesh” “from front to back without ever quite liking it, without ever quite giving into it.” But Luke Brown, in The Financial Times, called the book “refreshing, illuminating and true” for its portrait of a man who has stints as a soldier, security guard and property developer.\n\nSzalay, 51, whose name is pronounced SOL-loy, is the author of five previous books. Those include his 2008 debut, “London and the South-East,” about a sales executive who ends up stocking shelves in a grocery store; “Turbulence,” a series of interconnected stories in which all of the characters take flights; and “All That Man Is,” about men in various states of duress.\n\nSzalay is the first British Hungarian to win the prize, although another writer of Hungarian descent, Laszlo Krasznahorkai, received the International Booker Prize in 2015. Last month, Krasznahorkai was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nAt a news conference after Monday’s ceremony, Szalay said, “When Laszlo won the Nobel, I did kind of think, ‘Oh, God, has he taken the quota of Hungarian winning writers this year?’”\n\n“I’m a British writer, ultimately,” Szalay added, “but it’s quite a year for people with Hungarian names writing books.”\n\nOne aspect of “Flesh” that reviewers commended is its sparse and at times funny dialogue, particularly Istvan’s frequent use of the word “Okay” to respond to questions.\n\nAt Monday’s news conference, Doyle said the judges considered such dialogue to be part of the book’s appeal. Istvan was an old-school male, brought up not to cry and to be “a man of few words,” Doyle added — comparing him to characters in westerns. And it “didn’t do Clint Eastwood’s career any harm,” Doyle said.\n\n“If you were dealing with a real-life person trying to have a decent conversation with them, it would frustrate you somewhat,” Doyle said. “But when it’s presented on the page, to be honest, I found it riveting.”\n\nSzalay said at the news conference that, unlike in 2016, he had spent the night feeling “eerily calm,” having persuaded himself beforehand that he wouldn’t take home the prize.\n\nAs a result, he was a little shocked to have won this year. But the event, he said, “was altogether a much more pleasant experience.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/business/low-income-shoppers-spending-snap.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:36:18-05:00","title":"Low-Income Shoppers Cut Spending and Businesses Worry","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As a result of uncertainty and delayed payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), low-income shoppers are cutting discretionary spending—especially on meat, frozen foods, and snacks—leading to significant declines in sales for retailers like Wright’s Market, Walmart, and Dollar General.

As much as 45 percent of his store’s sales come from customers using the food-assistance program and he isn’t sure whether those customers will be buying a Thanksgiving meal this year.\n\n“I’ve got a freezer full of turkeys,” Mr. Wright said. “We ordered inventory for holidays, all this stuff months ago. We’re on the hook for all of that.”\n\nFor the better part of two years, well before the federal government shut down and SNAP payments were paused, lower-income consumers have been slowing their spending, especially for discretionary items. Nearly three-quarters of individuals who receive SNAP benefits live below the poverty line, making less than $32,000 a year for a family of four.\n\nThe ripple effect of that spending pullback is being felt by retailers, food companies and restaurant chains.\n\n“We have now one of the worst consumer sentiments we have seen in decades as we go into the holiday season,” the Kraft Heinz chief executive, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, told investors last month.\n\nTraffic from low-income consumers at quick-service restaurants declined by “nearly double digits in the third quarter, a trend that’s persisted for nearly two years,” the McDonald’s chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, said on an earnings call last week.\n\nAnd at Papa John’s, even though consumers ordered more pizza in the third quarter, total sales were in effect flat as the “order mix shifted to more medium pizzas and fewer added toppings,” Todd Penegor, the pizza chain’s chief executive, told analysts last week.\n\nAdding to its troubles, the food industry has been in the cross hairs of the Trump administration all year. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has blamed companies for a variety of the nation’s chronic ills  and is pressuring manufacturers to remove artificial colors.\n\nAnd the shutdown isn’t the only impact on SNAP benefits. The latest budget bill tightened rules around who is eligible for the program and made billions of dollars in cuts in the coming years.\n\nSeparately, a dozen states, including Nebraska, West Virginia and Florida, have received approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to bar people from using SNAP dollars to purchase items like sodas, energy drinks and candy.\n\nFood manufacturers and restaurants in recent months have been looking for ways to keep lower-income consumers buying.\n\nPepsiCo, the maker of popular chips like Doritos and Cheetos, began emphasizing smaller individual bags and multipacks on shelves later in the month when consumers are stretching their paychecks.\n\nMcDonald’s said it expected to spend $75 million in the fourth quarter toward covering half of franchisees’ costs for offering value meals at lower prices, like a $5 Sausage Egg and Cheese McGriddle or a 10-piece Chicken McNugget Meal for $8, as a way to draw customers.\n\nBut some economists say the lapse in food-assistance payments is likely to cause lower-income households to scrutinize their spending more.\n\n“This is a shock to people’s income and their budgets,” said David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University. “Food is a necessity. They’ll protect that part of their budgets. But that will cut into their discretionary spending and it couldn’t happen at a worse time for lower-income consumers as we head into the holiday season.”\n\nA continued delay of $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments could negatively affect spending on meat, frozen foods, dairy and snacks, analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note in late October.\n\nAmong the companies with the greatest exposure to SNAP spending and households with less than $40,000 in annual income are Conagra, Kraft Heinz, Smithfield Foods, J.M. Smucker and General Mills, according to analysts.\n\nSmithfield said that about 7.5 percent of industry sales across the food categories it participates in come from SNAP benefits, adding that a disruption would have “a relatively minor impact” on the business. The other companies did not return requests for comment.\n\nAs for retailers, the bulk of SNAP dollars for groceries are spent at Walmart, Kroger, Costco and Albertsons, with Walmart receiving nearly 26 percent, according to consumer data firm Numerator.\n\nBut for Walmart, with annual revenues of $680 billion, the pause in spending for a few billion dollars isn’t likely to affect its business much, said Peter Keith, an analyst at the investment bank Piper Sandler.\n\nRather, Mr. Keith said retailers like Dollar General may feel a bigger hit as SNAP spending could represent a “mid-single-digit percent” of its total sales.\n\nJerome Bouyer, vice president of retail operations for Save A Lot, a discount-grocery chain with hundreds of stores, said consumers in recent weeks shifted away from fresh meat and produce to more-processed items like hot dogs, deli meats, ramen and pasta — which tend to be cheaper, more filling and longer lasting.\n\nThe proportion of SNAP sales varies considerably among Save A Lot locations, Mr. Bouyer said, from 10 percent to over 50 percent. Those more reliant on SNAP revenue may be forced to cut costs elsewhere, like labor.\n\nSome say that independent grocers serving smaller, or even rural communities, are likely to feel the most pain.\n\nCustomers at Simpson’s Local Market in Trinidad, Colo., used the last of their SNAP dollars in October for pantry and freezer items ahead of the November lapse in funding, said Molly Snook, a co-owner.\n\nSNAP and the state’s dollar-match program accounted for about 15 percent of monthly revenue, she estimated. And in the early days of November, sales were down 40 percent from the same period last month, she said. That sort of decline will be tough to manage since most months the store just breaks even, she said.\n\nWright’s Market has not yet seen the impact of benefit cuts because Alabama typically distributes SNAP benefits beginning on the 4th of the month. But Mr. Wright said that his customers were already “very much trying to stretch every dollar they have,” by purchasing marked-down food and private label products and swapping out expensive items like beef for pork and chicken.\n\nMr. Wright, who posts videos on social media to help customers understand food inflation and has won awards for improving access to food in his community, says he has been actively trying to help his customers and employees during this time.\n\nBut with all the disruptions to SNAP, he wondered, “How do I do that and still make a profit?”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/nyregion/chi-osse-hakeem-jeffries.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"18:21:12-05:00","title":"Against Mamdani’s Wishes, Gen Z Councilman Plans to Challenge Jeffries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chi Ossé, a 27-year-old progressive city councilman aligned with Zohran Mamdani, is planning to run against Hakeem Jeffries in the June 2026 primary, inspired by Mamdani’s own political journey.

policies of Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, has told political allies that he is planning to challenge Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the top House Democrat, in next June’s primary.\n\nMr. Ossé, 27, hopes to follow Mr. Mamdani’s unlikely path, combining a vibrant social media presence, an insurgent campaign and on-the-ground support from left-leaning groups to lift him to victory.\n\nBut he may not have the mayor-elect’s support.\n\nMr. Ossé has spoken to various Democrats about his intentions, and is expected to announce his bid against Mr. Jeffries in the next few weeks, according to two people who have spoken to him in recent days.\n\nWhen asked about his plans, Mr. Ossé did not confirm or deny them. He said in a statement that he had been “hearing a lot of concern about Democratic Party leadership. It’s a big part of why I worked so hard to get Zohran elected and defeat the establishment’s champion, Andrew Cuomo.”\n\n“Right now, I’m focused on serving my constituents and guaranteeing the success of Zohran’s agenda at City Hall,” he added.\n\nMr. Mamdani has privately tried to discourage his ideological ally from running. The mayor-elect and his team fear that another high-profile challenge from the left might compromise his own bid to push the Democratic establishment to support his affordability agenda.\n\nMr. Mamdani also may want to avoid the optics of having Mr. Ossé challenge the House Democratic leader, who endorsed Mr. Mamdani in October after months of negotiation.\n\nThe disagreement caused Mr. Ossé to be disinvited from Mr. Mamdani’s election night watch party, according to two people familiar with the matter, even though he has been a frequent presence at Mr. Mamdani’s campaign events. Instead, Mr. Ossé said he spent the night “with my constituents at D.S.A. events celebrating Zohran’s incredible win.”\n\nMr. Mamdani on Monday sidestepped questions about Mr. Ossé, saying he was solely focused on preparing for his inauguration and would keep his “opinions just to the work of the transition.” Mr. Ossé’s plans to challenge Mr. Jeffries were first reported by The New York Post.\n\nFor Mr. Jeffries, any primary challenge will be a distraction from his main priority of trying to lead House Democrats into the majority. He has not run in a competitive primary since 2012, when he first won office in a Brooklyn district that encompasses gentrifying communities as well as working-class Black neighborhoods that tend to be more moderate, like East New York and Canarsie.\n\nJustin Chermol, a spokesman for Mr. Jeffries, said he “is focused on addressing the crushing Republican health care crisis, combating Donald Trump’s scheme to gerrymander congressional maps and leading the effort to take back the House of Representatives in 2026.”\n\nDemocratic leaders have historically tried to discourage insurgent candidates, especially from the left, from challenging incumbents. That has not stopped several primary challenges to state lawmakers, including one whose district overlaps with Mr. Jeffries.\n\nAny challenger ideologically aligned with Mr. Mamdani may hope that the mayor-elect, now a national figure who can raise large sums of cash for allies, would support their campaigns.\n\nBut Mr. Mamdani and his aides have stressed that he would not simply follow the endorsements of the local D.S.A. chapter, and would look to back candidates who can help him deliver on his agenda. It appears that Mr. Ossé may not meet Mr. Mamdani’s requirement.\n\nMr. Ossé, who was first elected at the age of 23 to the City Council in 2021, did not unconditionally support Mr. Mamdani for mayor until late May. He initially donated to the mayoral campaign of Brad Lander, the city comptroller, and to State Senator Zellnor Myrie; he could not donate to Mr. Mamdani because his campaign had already maxed out on contributions. He later told supporters to rank Mr. Mamdani No. 1 on their primary ballots, one of the earliest councilmembers to do so.\n\nHe has gained prominence for his accessible distillations of progressive policies on TikTok and Instagram. Last year, he introduced legislation, which passed and took effect in June, that forces many landlords to cover broker fees, instead of renters.\n\nLike Mr. Mamdani, Mr. Ossé will seek support from the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, an influential organizing engine that has helped local progressives like Mr. Mamdani win recent elections. But unlike Mr. Mamdani, whose membership in the group dates back to 2017, Mr. Ossé’s roots are not as deep.\n\nHe said last month that he had recently joined the group, but as recently as 2023, he was telling followers that he is “not a D.S.A. member nor was I endorsed by D.S.A.” If the chapter signals that it may not endorse him, it could affect his plans to run, two people who have spoken to him about the race said.\n\nMr. Ossé is expected to appear later this month before the D.S.A.’s electoral working group, which handles congressional endorsements.\n\nNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/nyregion/mlb-prop-bet-pitches-limits.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"18:31:51-05:00","title":"M.L.B.

Limits Bets on Individual Pitches After Gambling Charges\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T18:31:51-05:00\n\nThe day after two Cleveland Guardians pitchers were charged with setting up rigged bets on individual pitches, Major League Baseball announced that its betting company partners would limit this specific kind of bet, which the league said is more liable to manipulation.\n\nThe changes, which are to be implemented across the sportsbooks that compose nearly all of the legal sports betting market in the United States, include a new $200 limit for bets on individual pitches. They also will ban the inclusion of pitches in parlay bets, which combine wagers for longer odds, but a larger potential payout.\n\nRob Manfred, the M.L.B. commissioner, described these changes in a statement as “a national solution to address the risks posed by these pitch-level markets, which are particularly vulnerable to integrity concerns.”\n\nHe added: “We look forward to continuing to work with all stakeholders, including licensed sports betting operators, elected officials and regulators, to ensure we are always protecting the integrity of our game.”\n\nIt was the first tangible change — albeit a narrow one — to American sports gambling in response to rising concerns about game integrity following federal indictments for illegal gambling schemes. M.L.B. and N.B.A. players have been accused of manipulating their game performances to set up fraudulent bets, casting new doubts on the legitimacy of the sports that Americans love in large part because anything can happen.\n\nOn Sunday, the Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz were charged with sharing inside information about their pitches with bettors, who used that information to make hundreds of thousands of dollars on online gambling platforms. Lawyers for both Mr. Clase and Mr. Ortiz said that their clients were innocent.\n\nMr. Clase and Mr. Ortiz agreed with bettors before games to throw specific speeds and types of pitch, according to the indictment. Sometimes these pitches were part of parlay bets, authorities said.\n\nBoth players were placed on paid leave in July after M.L.B. began an investigation into suspicious wagering activity on their pitches. After the investigation began, Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio, called on both sports leagues and regulators in his state to ban so-called proposition bets, which are made on events or player performances not directly tied to a game’s outcome.\n\nWhat M.L.B. announced on Monday is a narrower measure. It limits, but does not ban, one specific kind of prop bet. In its statement, the league argued that most such bets carry “limited integrity risk” because they involve events that are influenced by more than one person.\n\nBut a subcategory of prop bets, referred to as microbets — wagers on one-off events that are resolved quickly — presents “heightened integrity risks,” the league said.\n\nIn recent years, betting companies have expanded the number and types of events within games that bettors can put money on. This has been a boon to both the sportsbooks and the leagues, which believe that betting during games boosts fan engagement and viewership, in turn increasing profits.\n\nThe gambling industry has pushed back against proposals to ban entire categories of bets at both the state and federal level, arguing that bettors would instead take their business to illegal offshore sites. A total ban on prop bets could also affect the business of licensed sportsbooks by at least 20 percent, said Chris Grove, a partner emeritus at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a research firm.\n\nFanDuel and DraftKings, the two largest sportsbooks in the United States, whose ads are ubiquitous during M.L.B. games, both supported the changes announced by the league.\n\n“In collaboration with Major League Baseball, we have adjusted certain bet types to further deter bad actors while helping maintain fairness and trust in the game,” DraftKings said in a statement.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/nyregion/mamdani-fuleihan-deputy-mayor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:32:21-05:00","title":"Mamdani Fills 2 Top Posts With Government Veteran and Trusted Aide","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has made his first major appointments in New York City, naming veteran government official Dean Fuleihan as his top deputy mayor and longtime aide Elle Bisgaard-Church as chief of staff.

administration on Monday, tapping Dean Fuleihan, a well-known veteran of city and state government, to be his top deputy in City Hall.\n\nAs expected, Mr. Mamdani also announced that Elle Bisgaard-Church, his chief of staff in the State Assembly and longtime right-hand, will hold the same title in City Hall.\n\nThe selection of Mr. Fuleihan in particular was notably conventional after a campaign run on generational and ideological change. But Mr. Mamdani, 34, has long emphasized that he would need the help of government experts to implement his ambitious agenda and contend with President Trump.\n\nMr. Fuleihan, 74, has more experience than most. A longtime budget expert for the State Assembly, he served as former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s budget director before becoming his first deputy mayor, the job he will now return to.\n\nHe will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of city government. Aides to Mr. Mamdani noted that Mr. Fuleihan helped Mr. de Blasio navigate a contentious relationship with Mr. Trump during the president’s first term.\n\nMs. Bisgaard-Church, 34, is a democratic socialist like Mr. Mamdani, and led the small and unusually young group of campaign staff members who oversaw his remarkable rise from a backbench member of the Assembly to the youngest mayor in more than a century.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Mamdani said the appointments would help him build “a powerful and competent administration that delivers an affordable, livable city for working people.”\n\nMr. Mamdani will face a steep set of challenges when he takes office on Jan. 1. He campaigned on an expansive and expensive set of solutions to the city’s spiraling living costs: making buses free, expanding government-funded child care and freezing rent for nearly a million rent-stabilized apartments.\n\nTo do most of it, Mr. Mamdani will have to persuade state lawmakers and Gov. Kathy Hochul to not only approve his plans but raise billions of dollars in new revenue to pay for them, either through new taxes or other measures. Ms. Hochul has said she wants to work with Mr. Mamdani on the child care initiative, especially, but she raised doubts over the weekend about ending bus fares.\n\nThen there is Mr. Trump, a former New Yorker, who has dismissed Mr. Mamdani as a radical “communist.” The president has already threatened to withhold billions of dollars in crucial federal funds from the city or send in National Guard troops if Mr. Mamdani pursues policies he does not like.\n\nThe timing of Monday’s announcement, just after the mayor-elect returned from an annual post-election political gathering in Puerto Rico, suggested he was moving more quickly than his predecessors to roll out appointments.\n\nBoth Mayor Eric Adams, the outgoing mayor, and Mr. de Blasio waited until December to unveil their selections for first deputy mayor and other high-level positions.\n\nLast week, Mr. Mamdani appointed five women to run his transition committee. He is expected to make additional appointments in the coming weeks and has been meeting with candidates for schools chancellor, among other positions.\n\nMr. Fuleihan has spent months quietly advising Mr. Mamdani, Ms. Bisgaard-Church and others on the campaign as they prepared for the possibility of governing.\n\nHe spent much of his career as a top aide to Sheldon Silver, the former Assembly speaker. He joined Mr. de Blasio’s administration in 2013 to lead the mayor’s Office of Management and Budget, where he helped negotiate labor contracts. He was later elevated to first deputy mayor, a position that also meant he served as acting mayor when Mr. de Blasio left the state.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/health/fda-hormone-replacement-menopause.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:13:55-05:00","title":"F.D.A.

Will Remove Black Box Warnings From Hormone Treatments for Menopause\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T12:13:55-05:00\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration will remove the so-called black box warning from all hormone replacement products containing estrogen, Dr. Marty Makary, the agency’s commissioner, announced on Monday.\n\nThe labels will be rewritten with age-specific guidance indicating that there are long-term health benefits if treatment is begun within 10 years of the onset of menopause.\n\nThe changes, expected within six months, represent a radical turnabout in what women have been told about hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn 2003, large government-run clinical trials concluded that hormone pills did not protect against heart disease or dementia, and in fact raised the risk of blood clots and breast cancer. Medical guidelines since then have told women to use hormones only sparingly for menopausal symptoms like hot flashes.\n\nDr. Makary, long a champion of the treatment, asserted on Monday that in fact hormones can reduce cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline, and can improve bone health in postmenopausal women.\n\n“The long-term health benefits have been largely misunderstood,” Dr. Makary said. “Hormone replacement therapy may improve the health outcomes of women at a population level more than any other intervention, arguably, with the exception of antibiotics or vaccines.”\n\nAsked whether hormone use was safe for all women, he added that any patient with a predisposition to blood clots or a history of breast cancer fueled by hormones should avoid it. He acknowledged that there may be other contraindications.\n\nCritics opposed to removing the warning, the strongest kind the F.D.A. issues, had urged Dr. Makary to convene a scientific advisory panel to carry out a careful assessment of the evidence before making any changes to the label.\n\n“Removing the black box and putting warnings in a lengthy label that many doctors and most patients will not read is taking women’s health backward,” Diana Zuckerman, a scientist and president of the National Center for Health Research, said on Monday.\n\n“The claim that hormones for menopause is the best way to improve the health of women is inconsistent with years of research and will harm millions of women,” Dr. Zuckerman said. “There are many better ways to reduce the chances of osteoporosis, heart disease, cancer and dementia than hormone therapy for menopause.”\n\nHormone use has plummeted in recent decades. Even though estrogen is considered the most effective treatment for alleviating menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats and sleep loss, some doctors say that many women who could benefit avoid the treatment.\n\nHormone therapy has been used to relieve menopausal symptoms since the 1940s. By the 1980s, hormones were increasingly being prescribed to prevent cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, as well, even in women well past menopause, despite concerns that the treatment might raise the risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe popularity of hormones was driven largely by observational studies indicating that hormones protected women from heart disease.\n\nBut large randomized trials subsequently tested this hypothesis, and concluded that there were no benefits to hormone replacement therapy in terms of heart attacks — and that it actually increased the risk of blood clots and strokes.\n\nThe trials also concluded that combined hormones — progestin and estrogen — in pill form increased the risk of breast cancer. But the danger to individual women was small, especially in early menopause, and there was no increase in breast cancer with estrogen alone, which lowered heart attack risk among women in their 50s.\n\nHormones also offered some benefits, reducing osteoporosis-related bone fractures and colorectal cancer.\n\nCritics have questioned the conclusions and the methodology of the government-sponsored trials. Some of the risks were of borderline significance, they said, and women who wanted to reap long-term benefits from hormone treatment should initiate it soon after the onset of menopause.\n\nMany doctors who treat menopausal women had pushed for removing the black box warning from local vaginal estrogen products, noting that these are low-dose products applied topically, not oral formulations. These physicians argued that studies have shown minimal to no systemic absorption of hormones from such products.\n\nBut the risks and benefits of long-term use of vaginal estrogens are still unclear, because the studies have been of limited duration, some experts say.\n\nThe black box label currently on estrogen products says that oral estrogen, with or without progestin, should not be taken to prevent heart disease and increases the risk of probable dementia in women 65 and older, as well as blood clots and strokes.\n\nThe label warning says that combined estrogen and progestin pills — a formulation used to offset the risk of uterine cancer — increases the risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe label notes, however, that these risks were found in trials of specific hormone formulations, and that the risks may not carry over to products with different formulations or to topically applied or low-dose products.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/opinion/alex-karp-palantir-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"19:53:36-05:00","title":"Palantir C.E.O.

Alex Karp Finds a Safe Space With Trump\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T19:53:36-05:00\n\nOf all the tech chieftains who’ve learned to love Donald Trump’s authoritarianism, Palantir’s Alex Karp seems the most befuddling.\n\n“My biggest fear is fascism,” he told Michael Steinberger, author of a new biography of Karp, in 2019. The fragility of liberal democracy was, in Steinberger’s telling, one of Karp’s preoccupations. He moved to Germany for graduate school, hoping to understand, as Steinberger puts it, how “a pillar of European civilization” had “descended into barbarism.” He wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the rhetoric of fascism, focusing particularly on a 1998 speech by the German novelist Martin Walser complaining that Holocaust remembrance had become a “moral bludgeon” against his country.\n\nKarp was a progressive in 2004 when he became the chief executive of Palantir, the data surveillance company co-founded by his former law school classmate Peter Thiel. The Wall Street Journal referred to him as a “self-described socialist” in 2018. The next year, he boasted to Steinberger, a contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine, that by helping to thwart terrorist attacks in Europe — and the attendant nativist backlashes — Palantir was a bulwark against the far right. In 2024, he supported Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris.\n\nYet now, Karp has become an enthusiastic enabler of Donald Trump. His company works with ICE to target people for Trump’s mass deportation campaign. It’s helping the administration compile enormous amounts of data on Americans, which could, as The New York Times reported, give the president “untold surveillance power.” Karp donated $1 million for Trump’s inauguration, and Palantir is helping to pay for his new ballroom.\n\nIn “The Philosopher In the Valley: Alex Karp, Palantir, and the Rise of the Surveillance State,” Steinberger points out that even Karp’s views on Walser appear to have changed. In Karp’s dissertation, he was a fascist figure. But this year, Karp and his colleague Nicholas Zamiska published a book called “The Technological Republic” that depicts Walser as a free speech hero who voiced “the forbidden desires and feelings of a nation.”\n\nI read Steinberger’s book because I wanted to understand Karp’s political evolution. But while the book is fascinating and prodigiously researched — including dozens of interviews Steinberger did with Karp — it didn’t quite answer my question. Among the tech bros who’ve clustered around Trump, some, like Elon Musk, seem to have let their own algorithms cook their brains. Others, like Mark Zuckerberg, are just phenomenally craven. But Karp, Steinberger told me, needed “to find a reason beyond just opportunism and necessity” to embrace Trumpism. His reasoning, however, is so incoherent it seems pretextual.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Gambling Scandal\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T18:11:46-05:00\n\nProfessional sports has been rattled by federal indictments involving illegal gambling schemes that accuse N.B.A. and Major League Baseball players of manipulating their performances to set up fraudulent bets on nearly invisible nuances of games.\n\nAs leagues grapple with the fallout, one central issue is the availability of incremental bets that do not depend on the game’s outcome and thus may be easier to manipulate.\n\nOn Monday, the day after two Cleveland Guardians pitchers were charged with setting up rigged bets on individual pitches, M.L.B. said that its betting company partners would limit this specific kind of bet because it carried the greatest risk for misconduct.\n\nThe indictments accused the pitchers, Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, of sharing inside information about pitches with bettors. Lawyers for both Mr. Clase and Mr. Ortiz said that their clients were innocent.\n\nPreviously, the N.B.A. players Jontay Porter and Terry Rozier had been accused of telling bettors that they would leave games early, enabling them to wager on their underperformance. Mr. Porter, who was charged in 2024, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and has been banned from the league. Mr. Rozier was charged last month and has denied wrongdoing.\n\nMany people think of sports gambling as simply placing bets on wins and losses. But as legalized betting has spread across the United States, the volume and types of bets that customers can make have grown exponentially.\n\nHere’s what to know about the bets that are being scrutinized:\n\nA proposition, or prop, bet is a wager on an event or player performance not directly tied to the game’s outcome. Examples include whether a player will score more or less than a certain number of points, whether a specific batter will hit a home run or whether a game will reach overtime. Prop bets are also combined into a riskier wager that is growing in popularity, the parlay, which involves two or more outcomes.\n\nProp bets are a core business for betting companies, or sportsbooks. Chris Grove, a partner emeritus at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a research firm, said that prop bets, at a conservative estimate, account for around 20 percent of money wagered at regulated sportsbooks in the United States.\n\nMicrobets are a subset of proposition bets. They can be resolved within seconds and are tied to live game action. Examples include whether the next basket will be for two points or for three, or the outcome of a single baseball pitch. Jason Robins, chief executive of DraftKings, said on an August earnings call that microbets account for a single-digit percentage of the total money wagered at the sportsbooks.\n\nIn team sports, rigging an entire game is a tall order that would probably require coordination among several players. An individual can much more readily control his or her own performance — by leaving a game early because of a supposed injury or illness, for example, as both Mr. Porter and Mr. Rozier were accused of doing.\n\nManipulating a single play, as Mr. Clase and Mr. Ortiz have been accused of doing, by intentionally throwing balls, may appear to be a simple mistake. This phenomenon, referred to as spot fixing, has also been a source of scandal internationally, including among Pakistan’s cricket team and Australia’s National Rugby League.\n\nThe changes M.L.B. announced on Monday represented the first tangible action by a league since the federal indictments. The league said that its partners, which encompass nearly all the legal sports betting companies in the United States, will institute a $200 limit for bets on individual pitches. They also will stop including pitches in the parlays, which carry longer odds but a larger possible payout.\n\nRob Manfred, the commissioner, called the limitations “a national solution to address the risks posed by these pitch-level markets, which are particularly vulnerable to integrity concerns.”\n\nThere have been other efforts. Charlie Baker, president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, successfully petitioned several states to ban prop bets on university athletes, citing concerns about both integrity and athlete harassment.\n\nPublic health experts have also said microbets are akin to slot machines, because of the brief time between making the bet and learning if you won or lost. Dan Hutchison, a Democratic assemblyman in New Jersey, proposed a bill in July to ban microbets for both integrity and public health reasons.\n\nBaseball is a game with ample stops and starts and myriad statistics, creating more betting opportunities on discrete events. Nearly every action on the diamond is accounted for and tabulated.\n\nBut the indictment presents one example in which a single play could not be successfully manipulated: In a May 28, 2025, game between the Guardians and the Los Angeles Dodgers, prosecutors say, Mr. Clase intentionally threw a ball. The batter, Andy Pages, nevertheless swung and missed, making it a strike.\n\nThe bettors lost.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/nyregion/jonathan-braun-resentencing.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:51:02-05:00","title":"Felon Freed by Trump Is Sentenced Again, This Time to 27 Months","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jonathan Braun, a former drug and money laundering convict, was sentenced to 27 months in prison in November 2025 after being accused of multiple crimes including sexual assault, violent threats, and predatory lending.

He is at least the eighth convict to whom Mr. Trump granted clemency during his first term who has since been charged with a crime. Several others pardoned more recently after being convicted of offenses committed during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol have also run into trouble with the law.\n\nMr. Braun, despite receiving a commutation from Mr. Trump, was still on supervised release, essentially a federal version of parole. But prosecutors said Mr. Braun had continued a pattern of violence, including sexually assaulting a nanny, swinging an IV pole at a nurse and threatening a congregant at his synagogue. He was also accused of assaulting a 3-year-old, and was continuing to make usurious loans to struggling small businesses.\n\nJudge Kiyo A. Matsumoto of Federal District Court in Brooklyn found this year that Mr. Braun had violated the terms of his supervised release, and federal prosecutors asked that the judge sentence him to five years in prison.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Matsumoto gave Mr. Braun 27 months, but he will have to serve only 20, thanks to credit for time in custody this year. The judge also said he must serve three and a half years of supervised release after his sentence, and undergo six months of residential treatment for drug abuse and mental illness.\n\nJudge Matsumoto said that when she sentenced him in 2019 in his original drug and money laundering case, she trusted that he would follow through on the promises he had made at that sentencing hearing. She noted that Mr. Trump had commuted Mr. Braun’s original sentence after he had served only a little over a year in prison.\n\n“Very few people are able to achieve this kind of privilege, second chance,” the judge said.\n\nMr. Braun read a statement in court on Monday in which he claimed that he was a changed person, and his lawyer said he had suffered “drug-induced bipolar mania” caused by an addiction to 2C-B, a synthetic psychedelic. But the lawyer, Kathryn Wozencroft of the Federal Defenders of New York, said that his drug use was not an excuse.\n\n“Mr. Braun was out of control, acting in a manic way,” she said, adding that his family had tried to help him to no avail. “Unfortunately, there was no ability to reason with Mr. Braun.”\n\nProsecutors expressed skepticism that Mr. Braun had changed, noting that he had made similar “leniency pleas” before his last sentencing in 2019 but had still violated his supervised release.\n\nA prosecutor, Tanya Hajjar, pointed out that Mr. Braun had not paid fines he owes, despite being wealthy, and that before he was apprehended this year he had “repeatedly evaded” a $4 toll while driving his Ferrari and Lamborghini.\n\nSuch behavior shows a “total lack of respect for the court” and that Mr. Braun believes he is “above the rule of law,” Ms. Hajjar said.\n\nProsecutors read from a victim impact statement written by Mr. Braun’s former live-in nanny, who said Mr. Braun had entered her room and put her into a headlock. Then, she said, Mr. Braun moved her hand over his bare genitals and groped her breasts.\n\nIn the statement, the woman said the episode had been one of the most difficult experiences of her life.\n\nMr. Braun’s case demonstrates how Mr. Trump has eschewed a longstanding Justice Department process of formally reviewing clemency applications, instead handing out pardons and commutations in a freewheeling manner unlike any previous president. He has helped supporters, comparing their prosecutions to the witch hunts he says were waged against him.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2023 that Mr. Trump’s decision to grant Mr. Braun clemency damaged an investigation into predatory lending by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan.\n\nThat office had been trying to cut a deal with Mr. Braun in which he would be released in exchange for cooperating. By commuting Mr. Braun’s sentence, Mr. Trump removed the government’s leverage and the investigation foundered.\n\nMr. Braun’s troubles began more than 15 years ago, when he fled to Israel to evade federal prosecutors investigating him as one of New York’s most prominent marijuana dealers. He was placed on an Interpol list, and by 2010 he had returned to New York, where he ultimately pleaded guilty.\n\nDuring the years after Mr. Braun’s drug plea, when he was allowed to remain free on supervised release, he became involved in predatory lending to small businesses. He was accused of violently threatening at least eight debtors, according to court records.\n\nNot until May 2019 was Mr. Braun was sentenced by Judge Matsumoto to 10 years in prison; he reported in 2020. Mr. Trump commuted his sentence just before leaving the presidency, after Mr. Braun’s family hired the lawyer Alan Dershowitz, Mr. Trump’s ally at the time, to lobby on his behalf.\n\nAfter Mr. Braun was released, his bad behavior resumed, with a flurry of disturbing transgressions, prosecutors said.\n\nLast year, Mr. Braun was arrested after he was accused of punching his 75-year-old father-in-law in the head. Mr. Braun struck his father-in-law twice as he tried to protect his daughter from Mr. Braun, who was chasing her while the couple argued in their Long Island home, according to Nassau County prosecutors.\n\nMr. Braun’s wife, Miriam Hurwitz, according to court documents, told the police that Mr. Braun had assaulted her twice in the previous five weeks. On July 17, 2024, the documents said, Mr. Braun threw his wife off a bed onto the floor, “causing her substantial pain and bruising her legs.”\n\nDespite that arrest and four others, Mr. Braun was allowed to remain free. Only this past April, after he was charged with assaulting the child, was he brought before Judge Matsumoto. She ordered him detained.\n\nAlong with the violent conduct he was accused of, Mr. Braun had also failed to pay a $100,000 fine imposed at his 2019 sentencing. In September, Judge Matsumoto ruled that Mr. Braun had violated his terms of release.\n\n“I have no one to blame other than my own actions,” Mr. Braun told the court on Monday. “It’s all on me.”\n\nReading from his statement, he apologized to the victims, his wife, his children and his family. “I refused to get the help that I needed,” he said.\n\nMr. Braun thanked the judge for incarcerating him when she did — “It saved my life,” he said — and allowing him to become sober and attend mental health treatment.\n\n“I’m embarrassed with what I did,” he said. “I own up to it.”\n\nKenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/opinion/government-shutdown-democrats-republicans.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:03:57-05:00","title":"What Were Democrats Thinking?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, a government shutdown sparked by Democratic opposition to the expiration of Affordable Care Act tax credits became a pivotal political event.

government, I kept hearing the same warning from veterans of past shutdown fights: The president controls the bully pulpit. He controls, to some degree, which parts of the government stay open and which parts close. It is very, very hard for the opposition party to win a shutdown.\n\nWhich makes it all the more remarkable that Democrats were winning this one. Polls showed that most voters blamed Republicans, not Democrats, for the current shutdown — perhaps because President Trump was bulldozing the East Wing of the White House rather than negotiating to reopen the government. Trump’s approval rating has been falling — in CNN’s tracking poll, it dipped into the 30s for the first time since he took office again. And last week, Democrats wrecked Republicans in the elections and Trump blamed his party’s losses in part on the shutdown. Democrats were riding higher than they have been in months.\n\nThen, over the weekend, a group of Senate Democrats broke ranks and negotiated a deal to end the shutdown in return for — if we’re being honest — very little.\n\nThe guts of the deal are this: Food assistance — both SNAP and WIC, I was told — will get a bit more funding, and there are a few other modest concessions on spending levels elsewhere in the government. Laid-off federal workers will be rehired and furloughed federal workers given back pay. Most of the government is funded only until the end of January. (So get ready: We could be doing this again in a few months.) Most gallingly, the deal does nothing to extend the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits over which Democrats ostensibly shut down the government in the first place. All it offers is a promise from Republicans to hold a vote on the tax credits in the future. Of the dozen or so House and Senate Democrats I spoke to over the past 24 hours, every one expected that vote to fail.\n\nTo understand why this shutdown will end with such a whimper, you need to understand the strange role the A.C.A. subsidies played in it. Democrats said the shutdown was about the subsidies, but for most of them, it wasn’t. It was about Trump’s authoritarianism. It was about showing their base — and themselves — that they could fight back. It was about treating an abnormal political moment abnormally.\n\nThe A.C.A. subsidies emerged as the shutdown demand because they could keep the caucus sufficiently united. They put Democrats on the right side of public opinion — even self-identified MAGA voters wanted the subsidies extended — and held the quivering Senate coalition together. You shut the government down with the Democratic caucus you have, not with the Democratic caucus you want.\n\nBut the shutdown was built on a cracked foundation. There were Senate Democrats who didn’t want a shutdown at all. There were Senate Democrats who did want a shutdown but thought it strange to make their demand so narrow: Was winning on health care premiums really winning the right fight? Should Democrats really vote to fund a government turning toward authoritarianism as long as health insurance subsidies were preserved?\n\nAnd what if winning on the health care fight was actually a political gift to Trump? Absent a fix, the average health insurance premium for 20 million Americans will more than double. The premium shock will hit red states particularly hard. Tony Fabrizio, Trump’s longtime pollster, had released a survey of competitive House districts showing that letting the tax credits expire might be lethal to Republican efforts to hold the House. Why were Democrats fighting so hard to neutralize their best issue in 2026?\n\nThe political logic of the shutdown fight was inverted: If Democrats got the tax credits extended — if they “won” — they would be solving a huge electoral problem for Republicans. If Republicans successfully allowed the tax credits to expire — if they “won” — they would be handing Democrats a cudgel with which to beat them in the elections.\n\nThis is why Senator Chuck Schumer’s compromise, which offered to reopen the government if Republicans extended the tax credits for a year, struck many Democrats as misguided. Morally, it might be worth sacrificing an electoral edge to lower health insurance premiums. But a one-year extension solved the Republicans’ electoral problem without solving the policy problem. Why on earth would they do that?\n\nIn any case, Republicans were not interested in Schumer’s offer. Trump himself has shown no interest in a deal. Rather than negotiating over health care spending, Trump has been ratcheting up the pain the shutdown is causing. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been furloughed or fired. The administration has been withholding food assistance from Americans who desperately need it. Airports are tipping into chaos as air traffic controllers go without pay.\n\nMore than anything else, this is what led some Senate Democrats to cut a deal: Trump’s willingness to hurt people exceeds their willingness to see people get hurt. I want to give them their due on this: They are hearing from their constituents and seeing the mounting problems, and they are trying to do what they see as the responsible, moral thing. They do not believe that holding out will lead to Trump restoring the subsidies. They fear that their Republican colleagues would, under mounting pressure, do as Trump had demanded and abolish the filibuster. (Whether that would be a good or a bad thing is a subject for another column.) This, in the end, is the calculation the defecting Senate Democrats are making: They don’t think a longer shutdown will cause Trump to cave. They just think it will cause more damage.\n\nIf I were in the Senate, I wouldn’t vote for this compromise. Shutdowns are an opportunity to make an argument, and the country was just starting to pay attention. If Trump wanted to cancel flights over Thanksgiving rather than keep health care costs down, I don’t see why Democrats should save him from making his priorities so exquisitely clear. And I worry that Democrats have just taught Trump that they will fold under pressure. That’s the kind of lesson he remembers.\n\nBut it’s worth keeping this in perspective: The shutdown was a skirmish, not the real battle. Both sides were fighting for position, and Democrats, if you look at the polls, are ending up in a better one than they were when they started. They elevated their best issue — health care — and set the stage for voters to connect higher premiums with Republican rule. It’s not a win, but given how badly shutdowns often go for the opposition party, it’s better than a loss.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

He was building them for Ukrainian forces in his parents’ garage with a friend.\n\nThe military was not interested.\n\n“‘You can’t just waltz into the Pentagon as 21-year-olds and sell weapon systems to the D.O.D.,’” said the friend, Olaf Hichwa, recalling the response from a senior Department of Defense official.\n\nBut two years later, Mr. Monroe-Anderson, now 22, and Mr. Hichwa, who just turned 24, are selling drones to the U.S. Army.\n\nNeros, the company they founded in 2023, has been selected to supply its signature drones, called Archer, to the Army, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. Neros is one of three American drone manufacturers picked as vendors for the first phase of an Army program that is buying low-cost, expendable drones.\n\nAlthough specific financial terms have not been disclosed, the Trump administration has budgeted more than $36 million for the “Purpose-Built Attritable Systems” program in 2026.\n\nNeros’s selection comes as military leaders are scrambling to catch up with adversaries who have the ability to mass-produce small drones, which have become crucial to modern warfare. The Army aims to buy at least one million drones in the next two to three years, Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll told Reuters on Friday.\n\nAlthough the government shutdown has complicated the military’s efforts to buy drones, some contracts already in the pipeline are moving forward.\n\nThe Army contract has been closely watched as a bellwether of which American drone companies will dominate the market. For Neros, it comes on the heels of raising $75 million in venture funding, led by Sequoia Capital, and receiving a $17 million Marine Corps contract for thousands of drones, as well as an international drone coalition contract to supply 6,000 drones to Ukraine.\n\nNeros’s latest round of funding closed last week, bringing the total raised by the start-up to $121 million and cementing Mr. Monroe-Anderson’s and Mr. Hichwa’s status as wunderkinds of the emerging U.S. drone industry.\n\nThe Defense Innovation Unit, an experimental part of the Pentagon with headquarters in Silicon Valley, has been championing Neros for more than a year, with some drone specialists at the unit affectionately referring to Mr. Monroe-Anderson and Mr. Hichwa as “the boys.”\n\nAt a flyoff in Alaska this summer, military officials crowded around Mr. Monroe-Anderson as he piloted his drone unmolested toward a device that tried unsuccessfully to jam it. A Neros Archer was one of several drones buzzing around Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in July when he made a video announcement of policy changes aimed at turbocharging domestic production.\n\nIn an interview in May, Maj. Steven Atkinson of the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab recounted searching for American companies willing to supply small drones like the ones being used in Ukraine for less than $2,000 per unit. He came up empty — until he found Neros.\n\n“They were pretty young, but they did F.P.V.s,” Major Atkinson recalled, referring to first-person view drones, which are flown by pilots wearing special goggles to see video feeds from the drone’s camera, while using a joystick controller to navigate around obstacles.\n\n“What they have been able to accomplish is unheard-of,” he said.\n\nMr. Monroe-Anderson and Mr. Hichwa gained their expertise from the world of competitive drone racing. Mr. Monroe-Anderson, who attended high school in New Hampshire, and Mr. Hichwa, who grew up in Maryland, spent their teen years building drones from kits and components they ordered from China. They were so focused on flying and racing that they skipped much of school and their senior proms. Neither has a college degree.\n\nThe two met in 2017 at a drone racing competition in Muncie, Ind., and quickly began trading ideas about how to make their drones fly faster.\n\nMr. Monroe-Anderson was the better racer, winning the MultiGP World Championship in 2020. Mr. Hichwa was known for his engineering prowess. “He’s a mad genius,” said David Spencer, a fellow racer.\n\nIn an attempt to best Mr. Monroe-Anderson’s drone, Mr. Hichwa designed a circuit board for his own drone that was lighter than the ones on the market, soldering it himself. He eventually bought an industrial machine from China that mass-produced them, selling them to other drone racers for $30 apiece during his junior year. An upgraded version is used in Neros’s Archer.\n\nDespite their racing pedigree, challenges remain. Drone racers tend to build systems that are fast and nimble, and require a certain level of mastery. Neros typically trains soldiers on Archer drones for five days. By contrast, DJI, the Chinese company that produces more than 75 percent of the world’s commercial drones, is known for drones that can be flown without any special training.\n\nAnd the skill it takes to make one racing drone is different from the expertise required to manufacture tens of thousands. At Neros’s factory in El Segundo, Calif., about 20 technicians assemble roughly 2,000 drones per month by hand.\n\nIt has been especially challenging to make cheap drones without Chinese parts. Virtually everything they used as teenagers — propellers, motors, batteries, radios, cameras — came from Shenzhen, China. But to sell to the U.S. military, Neros had to build a U.S. supply chain and prove that its drones do not contain critical components from China.\n\nVendors in the United States “would laugh at us,” Mr. Hichwa said. American-made radios could cost as much as $10,000 when he was shopping around for one that cost $30. The founders quickly realized that they would have to build parts themselves and seek suppliers outside the defense industry.\n\nInstead of using computer chips common in military equipment that cost hundreds of dollars apiece, Neros used one designed for parking meters, which cost $1 each, Mr. Hichwa said.\n\nTheir inspiration to build a drone company grew out of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which turned their high school hobby into a world-changing technology. Ukrainians were beating back Russian forces with simple quadcopters jury-rigged with explosives. In the summer of 2023, Mr. Hichwa was working at Skywalk, an artificial intelligence start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., when Mr. Monroe-Anderson showed up at his job, begging him to make drones again. Mr. Monroe-Anderson, who opted to forgo college for the time being, had become fixated with helping Ukraine.\n\nMr. Hichwa took it on as a side project, and quickly got sucked in. They conferred on the phone with Ukrainians whom Mr. Monroe-Anderson had met on social media and made dozens of drones that snapped together in stacks that were easy to transport. That fall, they went to Kyiv and distributed their drones to Ukrainian soldiers, collecting feedback about how they flew. They met Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who is also the country’s minister of digital transformation, who told them that anyone who wanted to supply drones to Ukraine had to be able to produce at least 5,000 per month.\n\nThe trip underscored what they already knew: America itself is vulnerable. Russia and China produced millions of drones a year, while the United States barely made 100,000.\n\nThey set up shop in El Segundo, a hotbed for the aerospace industry, where their passion attracted the attention of venture capitalists and Peter Thiel, who eventually gave Mr. Monroe-Anderson a Thiel fellowship.\n\n“When we meet founders like that, we bet on their trajectory,” said Ian Rountree of Cantos, a venture capital firm that led their angel round. He was impressed that Mr. Monroe-Anderson had managed to attract employees who were far more senior, including Sean Wood, the company’s chief operating officer, who had worked at SpaceX for 12 years. Neros employs 80 people, virtually all of them older than its founders.\n\nBut mass production remains a challenge. Last year, Mr. Hichwa traveled to Shenzen to meet the Chinese suppliers who had sent him drone parts when he was a teenage racer. They showed him around their factories as a valued customer, never suspecting that he planned to open a plant of his own. One factory that made the brand of hobbyist drones he flew in high school was now churning out 1,000 drones per day for the Russian military, he said.\n\n“They are, to a certain degree, my friends,” Mr. Hichwa said. “But we found ourselves on opposite sides of an armed conflict.”\n\nHe said he had tried to remember as much as he could about the machinery they used, awed by what it would take for Neros to catch up.\n\n“We’re barely scraping 2,000 a month,” he said. “And they’re doing that in two days.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/camp-mystic-lawsuit.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"Suits Accuse Camp Mystic of Gross Negligence in Children’s Deaths","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A lawsuit filed by the families of 27 victims — including five campers and two counselors — accuses Camp Mystic and the Eastland family of gross negligence during a deadly flash flood on July 4, 2025.

It portrays the family as overconfident and woefully underprepared for serious flooding, despite decades of experience and ample warnings.\n\nThe suit claims that Dick Eastland, the camp’s executive director, and his son Edward, a director, squandered a crucial window of time following the National Weather Service’s warning about “life threatening flash flooding” at 1:14 a.m. The leadership dismissed camp counselors’ early pleas for help, and then “made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster” only when it was too late, the lawsuit says.\n\nTwo counselors and 25 young campers died at Camp Mystic that night, most of them from two cabins that housed the youngest girls. Dick Eastland, 70, also died. Other camps along the Guadalupe River had to evacuate and rescue campers from the flooding, but Camp Mystic was the only sleepaway camp where campers died.\n\n“These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,” the suit says.\n\nAnother lawsuit filed in the same court on Monday by the parents of Eloise Peck, 8, presents a similar description of inadequate emergency planning.\n\nEastland family members have said little publicly about their actions during the flood, and their lawyer, Mikal Watts, did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nBut Mr. Watts, who represents the family and the camp, discussed the events in late October in an appearance on CNN. He called the evacuation of the camp “orderly” and mostly successful.\n\nMr. Watts’s account broadly matched the timeline that is laid out in the lawsuit. He said Dick Eastland and the camp’s night security guard, Glenn Juenke, met in the camp’s office “within minutes” after the Weather Service issued its alert, and were later joined by Edward Eastland. They convened the camp’s grounds crew to secure equipment, and then “started coming up with a plan” around 2 a.m., Mr. Watts said.\n\nCamp Mystic announced in September that it will reopen next summer for its 100th year of operation, using a nearby second campus that the camp opened in 2020. The older part of the camp complex, where the flooding and deaths occurred, will not be open to campers in 2026.\n\nMany of the families of campers who died in the flooding objected to the reopening. They pointed out that the body of one camper, Cile Steward, was still unaccounted for, and they complained that they were given only a few hours’ notice before the announcement.\n\nTexas passed a package of summer camp safety laws in September, a move championed by many of the parents of girls who died at Camp Mystic, who have banded together under the name “Heaven’s 27.” The Texas Legislature announced in October that it would conduct a formal investigation into the July flooding in the Hill Country, which killed more than 130 people along the Guadalupe River, including those at Camp Mystic.\n\n“I was shocked to see Camp Mystic begin signing up campers for next year with so many questions unanswered about what happened that fateful morning,” Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a statement announcing the investigation.\n\nThe multifamily suit filed on Monday describes the camp leadership as eager to cut corners and preserve the illusion of safety, while building “true generational wealth” from the camp’s low overhead costs and millions of dollars in annual revenue.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency determined in 2011 that much of Camp Mystic lay within a 100-year flood zone, meaning there was a 1 percent chance in any given year that it would be flooded. The Eastlands successfully challenged the agency’s maps, which would have designated the area of the camp as high-risk and required the owners to carry extra insurance.\n\nThe camp’s instructions to counselors in the event of a flood were minimal, and reassured them that “all cabins are constructed on high, safe locations.” Instead of being trained in evacuation procedures, the lawsuit says, “counselors flipped through their manuals with Edward and Mary Liz Eastland and were told a flood was not going to happen.”\n\nThe suit condemns the camp’s actions after the flooding, beginning with the initial notices to the parents in the late morning of July 4 that their daughters were “unaccounted for,” sent at a time when some girls’ bodies had already been found.\n\nThe suit seeks to establish that Camp Mystic was in a region known as “Flash Flood Alley,” where serious floods were a regular and predictable occurrence. Flooding killed people in the area and prompted summer-camp evacuations numerous times during the decades that Dick Eastland and his wife, Tweety, lived at the camp. In 1985, Mrs. Eastland had to be airlifted to a hospital to give birth because a flood had cut off road access.\n\nIn the early hours of July 4, Richard and Edward Eastland met in the camp’s main office about 30 minutes after the National Weather Service’s 1:14 a.m. warning of life-threatening flooding, and set the grounds crew to work securing equipment. At about 2:20 a.m., several counselors ran to the two men to ask for help, reporting that water was pouring into Bug House, the cabin closest to the river. The men went to the cabin and told the girls there to lay towels down and to stay put in the cabin.\n\nAround 2:30 a.m., the lawsuit says, campers and counselors from some cabins began evacuating to a large two-story recreation hall a short distance away, and Richard and Edward Eastland took some girls there in their vehicles. But over the course of an hour, they were able to evacuate only five of 11 cabins in the flood zone, according to the suit. Some counselors decided on their own to evacuate their campers, with the leaders of several cabins pulling girls through windows to escape and run up a nearby hill. They could hear screams for help from other cabins, the lawsuit says.\n\nTweety Eastland and Edward’s wife, Mary Liz Eastland, who are also leaders of the camp and are named as defendants in the lawsuit, were “nowhere to be found” throughout the flooding, the suit says. None of the defendants assisted or gave instructions to the many girls and counselors who made their way to the second floor of the recreation hall until later in the morning, it says.\n\nIt was around 3:51 a.m., Mr. Watts said, when Dick Eastland was swept away in his S.U.V., which an unnamed counselor cited in the suit said was full of campers from Bubble Inn, another flooded cabin. No one in the vehicle survived.\n\nThe camp’s supporters have characterized Mr. Eastland as a hero who died trying to save children during what the camp has called a “1,000-year weather event.” The lawsuit calls him “grossly negligent” for loading children into a vehicle in waist-deep, and then neck-deep, water and then attempting to drive. Driving through floodwaters violated the advice of experts including the Upper Guadalupe River Authority, a state agency on whose board Mr. Eastland was serving at the time of his death.\n\nAround the same time that Dick Eastland went to Bubble Inn, Edward Eastland went to Twins, a pair of adjoining cabin buildings where girls had been told to stay put, even though they could see that other cabins nearby were being evacuated to the recreation hall, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe girls in Twins climbed to top bunks to try to stay above the water. Some swam out of the cabin to try to reach safety; others were swept out by the water. Edward Eastland was swept through a door to a tree along with several girls, where they held on until the morning. The girls clinging to the tree “watched in horror as their friends floated by, begging for help,” the suit says. Eleven girls from Twins were killed.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/business/ohio-paper-mill-private-equity.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:35:07-05:00","title":"A MAGA Senator Promised Hope for a Dying Ohio Mill.

Then Reality Set In.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T14:35:07-05:00\n\nOne by one, black cars with tinted windows pulled up to the parking lot in the shadow of the paper mill. The governor of Ohio exited one car. One U.S. senator appeared, then the other. They were joined by the congressional representative from the district and the state attorney general.\n\nThe lineup of heavy political hitters had turned out in early April to show their support for the 850 employees who had been delivered a gut punch days earlier, when the private equity firm that owns the Chillicothe, Ohio, mill announced it was closing the plant in 60 days.\n\nThe politicians had come to deliver encouragement, but also good news.\n\nThe newly elected senator Bernie Moreno told the crowd that he’d just received a phone call from a top executive at the private equity firm promising that the facility would remain open until the end of the year, giving it more time to find a new owner.\n\nThe mill’s rescue was not assured, Mr. Moreno and the other politicians cautioned. But it was hard to find anyone in the crowd not buoyed by what Mr. Moreno called “a day of hope.”\n\n“It was amazing,” said Jeff Allen, the president of the union local and a third-generation papermaker, who also addressed the crowd this April. “I’m sitting there with the governor, two sitting U.S. senators, the district congressman, all the state officials — my votes didn’t put any of them in office. Historically, this union supported Democrats. And yet here are all these Republicans supporting us.”\n\nThis could be a new paradigm, he thought.\n\nDonald J. Trump’s promise to revive manufacturing in the United States had appealed to working class voters around the country last November, including many of Mr. Allen’s co-workers. Now, here was Mr. Moreno, a Make America Great Again standard-bearer, forcefully pounding the table for union jobs.\n\nIn a matter of days, it seemed that Mr. Moreno had — almost Trump-like — bent a private equity titan to his will, threatening in a blistering letter to conduct a federal investigation into the portfolio of businesses held by the firm, H.I.G. Capital.\n\nWhen Mr. Moreno announced on the stage that the firm’s chastened leaders had given the workers another six months, he added that he would be rolling up his sleeves to help find a buyer. The senator gave Mr. Allen his cellphone number and said an aide would be moving to Chillicothe to provide boots-on-the-ground help.\n\nAs Ohio continues to carve a new economic path, that April rally provided a vision: As an ever-deeper-red state, the home of central MAGA characters like Vice President JD Vance, the gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and Mr. Moreno, it could muscle its way to greater prosperity not only through a boom in artificial intelligence data centers across the state — but by turning back the clock through tariffs, coal and industrial manufacturing.\n\nIt might be too late for the steel mills in Youngstown, the rubber plants in Akron and the glass factories in Toledo.\n\nBut maybe, Mr. Allen hoped, the paper mill in Chillicothe would be different.\n\nSouth of Columbus on U.S. Route 23, the paper mill’s 475-foot-tall, red-and-white-ringed smokestack is visible from miles away.\n\nFor more than a century, the paper mill was owned by the Mead family, the maker of notebooks for generations of schoolchildren.\n\nChillicothe was the epitome of a company town. The Mead Company built a swimming pool that cost 25 cents for workers’ families to use and supported two amateur baseball teams on fields it built.\n\nThere was a time when workers would cash their paychecks at the Paint Grill, a watering hole next to the mill where they could throw back cold beers and wrap both hands around a Paper Maker, a double-decker cheeseburger with 10 ounces of ground beef.\n\nBut millwork took a physical toll. If you’ve been at the mill long enough, you know a story or two about a gruesome injury or death. Then there are the swing shifts, overtime hours, and missed birthdays and anniversaries, too many to count.\n\nThe 1990s marked the beginning of the mill’s steady decline. With the dawn of the digital age, there was less need for paper.\n\nThe mill underwent a steady churn of owners. Three of its last four owners have been private equity firms, including H.I.G. Capital, which manages a $70 billion portfolio. Three years ago, Miami-based H.I.G. bought Pixelle Specialty Solutions, which operated the mill.\n\nIn the paper industry, private equity has often followed a familiar playbook: Buy a distressed asset on the cheap and load it with debt, some of which is used to pay the private equity firm. Then, in a few years, the private equity firm sells the company or declares bankruptcy.\n\nAs the mill changed hands over the years, it was rarely good for the rank and file.\n\nInterviews with more than two dozen current and former employees describe the last 25 years as a period of underinvestment, poor management and declining morale. There have been more than a dozen mill managers in the last two decades. Maintenance and engineering departments withered, and in late 2022, about 90 veteran millworkers retired suddenly, creating a knowledge deficit that further crippled the operation.\n\nThere were safety issues, too. In June, the Chillicothe Fire Department was called in to help extinguish a fire that had started when sawdust piled up on an electrical panel. It was the second time in 15 months that the department was called in to help because the company’s own firefighting unit was overwhelmed, according to Chillicothe Fire Department records.\n\nMr. Moreno, whose family emigrated from Colombia when he was a child, made his fortune building an auto dealership empire in northern Ohio.\n\nHe was elected in 2024 after an expensive, sharp-elbowed campaign in which he leaned heavily on support from Mr. Trump. Mr. Moreno narrowly beat out Sherrod Brown, a liberal Democrat and stalwart union supporter, with 50.2 percent of the vote.\n\nIn an interview this summer, Mr. Moreno said his “north star” was his father-in-law, who went to work at the U.S. Steel plant in Gary, Ind., the day after his high school graduation, raised a family, owned a car, took vacations and retired “with total dignity and no debt.”\n\n“Sometimes people think the American dream is Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk,” he said. “But most Americans aspire to have a good, normal life.”\n\nMr. Moreno had held the office for only four months when H.I.G. Capital announced in April that it would be shuttering the paper mill. The announcement not only blindsided the workers, but was a shock to the state’s political leaders, who in recent years have aggressively sought to stanch the bleeding of blue-collar union jobs.\n\nSome voiced their anger. Others pledged support for the workers. Mr. Moreno jumped in with a fire-breathing letter to H.I.G. Capital’s top executives that hit on a familiar populist theme: Regular folks are losing out — in this case, to rich guys in Miami.\n\n“I’m here to inform you that such lecherous, self-serving and destructive behavior must end now,” Mr. Moreno wrote, noting that H.I.G. Capital had driven several companies into bankruptcy.\n\nHe demanded to know the financial terms of the acquisition, the yearly balance sheets for the mill and how much top executives profited. He also threatened to pursue Department of Justice and Department of Treasury investigations of companies owned by H.I.G. Capital.\n\n“I was extraordinarily pissed off,” Mr. Moreno said.\n\nBut that anger had a short shelf life. On the morning he spoke to the crowd in April, Mr. Moreno took a call from Brian Schwartz, a co-president of H.I.G. Capital, from inside a Chillicothe doughnut shop.\n\nMr. Schwartz, sounding apologetic, agreed to keep the plant open until the end of the year while helping find a buyer, according to Mr. Moreno. (H.I.G. Capital never announced the six-month extension. Mr. Schwartz did not respond to messages seeking comment.)\n\nThe senator was determined to find a new owner. He helped stir up a steady stream of potential buyers who were led around the paper mill. Some of the biggest names in the paper industry had a look, according to two people familiar with the visits who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the visits were supposed to be confidential. They included International Paper, Smurfit Westrock and Packaging Corporation of America. (The companies declined to comment or did not respond to an interview request.)\n\nBut the mill would have needed hundreds of millions of dollars in investment in new or reconfigured machines over the last 15 years in order to pivot from its primary product: carbon-less paper that has largely been made obsolete with the digitization of finance and medical forms, said a former plant manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still works in the paper industry.\n\nFaced with this reality, H.I.G. couldn’t even give the mill away.\n\nTyler Rajeski, the chief executive of Twin Rivers Paper in Madawaska, Maine, told his local Town Council in May that he had been offered the chance to “buy Chillicothe for a dollar, and I said no.”\n\nMr. Moreno returned to Chillicothe again on the first Saturday in June — not for a rally, but to deliver grim news to the union’s leadership: H.I.G. Capital would be closing the mill on Aug. 10, not at the end of the year, as the private equity firm had promised him.\n\nMr. Moreno said he had come to understand H.I.G. Capital’s plight. The mill had been hemorrhaging customers (and employees) since it announced the closing, and it was costing the firm millions to keep it open even for a few more months.\n\n“I’m a business guy,” Mr. Moreno said. “I understood that they were on a path that couldn’t be reversed. You realize it’s a monumental amount of money they would have to invest to turn it around.”\n\nMany of the millworkers were less understanding. The mill had provided generations with solid union wages and health care. It also gave them a sense of identity and pride of place.\n\nWorking a union job at the mill is as good as it gets for someone who isn’t much interested in leaving Chillicothe or going to college. Wages start around $25 per hour, and overtime often pushes pay into six figures in a place where money like that goes a long way.\n\n“I didn’t want you to think we’re just dumb rednecks,” Thomas Hamner, 27, said in an interview in June, a few days after a discussion at the union hall with a group of his co-workers veered into why so many of them had chosen not to leave Chillicothe, either to go to college or to pursue other opportunities.\n\n“I know a lot of really smart people who work low-budget jobs,” he added. “We’ve all stayed here because it’s our home and we don’t leave. People here stick together.”\n\nMr. Hamner didn’t have much growing up. Shortly after he graduated from high school, his grandfather, who had worked at the mill, helped him get a job there.\n\nMr. Hamner earned about $90,000 last year, but it was barely enough to keep pace with his spending and debts. He got a new tractor to work the five acres of rocky land he’d bought, but fell behind on payments and sold it for pennies on the dollar. The announcement in April that the mill would be closing came a week after Mr. Hamner learned that his wife, Shalynn, was pregnant with their second child. Their older son, Waylon, is 3.\n\nThe uncertainty over what’s next weighs on Mr. Hamner.\n\n“The only time it hit me is when I came to the realization that if my son wants a juice box or cupcakes, I can buy it for him,” he said in August.\n\nBut he’s not sure how long this will be true.\n\n“At least at this point in his life, I can say Waylon was spoiled and taken care of. I’m not sure I’ll be able to say that with the next one.” (Winston, their second son, was born a few weeks ago.)\n\nIn late July, a job fair had more than 70 businesses with displays set up inside the local college basketball gym. Cornerstone Caregiving. Diamond Power. Stewart Glass. Ohio Department of Corrections. Victoria’s Secret. A sheet metal apprentice program.\n\nAnd on and on.\n\nMill employees, some wearing pulp-spattered work boots, walked up and down the aisles of the job fair waiting for a conversation starter. To some it was like speed dating. Hi. What do you do at the mill? What kind of work are you looking for? Here’s a list of the jobs we have available.\n\nAs the job fair drew to a close, it became clear that even promising leads likely included a pay cut and required a much longer commute or even relocating.\n\nMr. Allen, the union president, spent much of his time arranging a training session for a few dozen workers, hoping it would bolster their skill set — and their qualifications for another manufacturing job.\n\n“I know the names to the faces,” he said of the millworkers. “They mean something to me.”\n\nBy early September, all that remained at the mill was a skeleton crew that did little more than keep the lights on. Hundreds of workers had received their last paychecks and had started calculating how to stretch out their severance checks while they looked for what’s next.\n\nBy then, Mr. Moreno knew what would become of the site even though he was not ready to disclose it publicly. It wasn’t the “white knight solution” he had hoped for. But it was “still a much better solution than doing what my opponent probably would have done — gone down there, organized a protest and gone home,” Mr. Moreno said, referring to Mr. Brown.\n\n“I’m not willing to sit back and say it’s too risky because what if something doesn’t work out? I gave it my all,” he said.\n\nAsked about his more conciliatory approach with H.I.G. Capital, which never turned over the financial details he had requested, Mr. Moreno said: “I applaud H.I.G. for how they’ve been since then. I don’t take anything back of what I said in that letter. I take nothing back what I’ve said publicly. It took that to get us to this point.”\n\nBut Mr. Brown, his Democratic opponent in the race last year, said that a broad coalition should have been involved, including union, city and county leaders, to exert pressure on H.I.G. Capital. He said Mr. Moreno showed his allegiance when he voted for Mr. Trump’s tax bill, which has tax benefits that will be a boon for private equity executives, like the ones at H.I.G. Capital.\n\n“You can make speeches — we all do,” said Mr. Brown, who is running for Ohio’s other Senate seat next year. “You can write nasty letters. You can call them out on the Senate floor. But if you’re not willing to vote and hold their feet to the fire on tax issues, they don’t really care.”\n\nLast month, Mr. Moreno arrived in town to make a grand announcement: The mill had been bought by the U.S. Paper Mill Company, a subsidiary of U.S. Medical Glove Company.\n\nA few dozen former paper mill workers crowded around a lectern in front of two rubber-glove-making machines that had been hastily installed in a vast warehouse where Mr. Moreno was to speak. The workers, most of them dressed in jeans, T-shirts and work boots, stood elbow to elbow with local political leaders and businesspeople in suits and polished shoes.\n\nThe workers were eager to hear more about the new venture, which Mr. Moreno told the crowd was just a start. In time, the company might employ 1,500 people and ensure that hospital gloves around the country, the boxes they are shipped in and the machines that make them in other countries would be manufactured in Chillicothe. He praised Mr. Schwartz, the H.I.G. Capital executive, who he said had agreed to contribute $5.5 million to a fund for the laid-off workers — though almost all of it won’t be distributed for five years. The price U.S. Medical Glove paid for the mill facility was not disclosed.\n\nBut Mr. Moreno declined to answer two fundamental questions: How many jobs would there be to start, and what would they pay? Neither could John Todoroki, the owner of U.S. Medical Glove, who did not address the crowd.\n\nMr. Todoroki, who peppers conversations with expletives, is not the button-down type. He said in an interview after the ceremony that he would try to pay workers close to what they were making at the paper mill and that he did not want to say publicly how many people he would be hiring.\n\n“The plan is to see if my plan is going to work, and we won’t know for 30 days,” he said.\n\nAnd then what?\n\n“I’m like an old dog with a bone in my jaw,” Mr. Todoroki said. “I don’t let go.”\n\nSeveral former workers who attended the ceremony said they were hopeful that the new jobs would be a good thing for Chillicothe even if they had little idea what the jobs were or how much they would pay. Callbacks would not be based on seniority — as the union had negotiated. And what about health benefits, overtime and vacation pay, which might be as many as five weeks?\n\nUnlike the jobs at the old paper mill, these new jobs would not be unionized. As of Thursday, the new company has 70 employees.\n\n“It’s anger, and it’s hurt,” said Mr. Allen, the now former union president, who was laid off at the end of August. “That was my life. I went there when I just turned 19. And here I am, 56. I’m angry at the whole process, and I’m hurt for all those employees.”\n\nMr. Allen said Mr. Moreno had called to inform him about the sale. Then the senator’s aide extended an invitation to speak at the ceremony celebrating the new ownership. Mr. Allen never responded.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-fort-dix-drug-program.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"19:32:24-05:00","title":"Rehab Program Could Trim Sean Combs’s Prison Sentence by a Year","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sean Combs, the disgraced music mogul convicted under the Mann Act for prostitution-related offenses, has been accepted into a drug rehabilitation program at Fort Dix federal prison, where he could see up to a one-year reduction in his sentence.

by a Year\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T19:32:24-05:00\n\nSean Combs, the fallen music mogul convicted of prostitution-related offenses, has been accepted into a drug abuse rehabilitation program that could reduce his sentence by up to a year, a spokesman for Mr. Combs said.\n\nThe program is offered at the sprawling federal prison complex in New Jersey, known as Fort Dix, where Mr. Combs recently arrived after a judge sentenced him to more than four years in prison.\n\nWith the time he has already spent in jail, the Bureau of Prisons had listed his release date as May 2028, which takes into account the 13 months Mr. Combs was held without bail at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, as well as potential time off for good behavior.\n\nThe drug abuse rehabilitation program, which involves intensive therapy, could knock off even more time. The spokesman for Mr. Combs, Juda Engelmayer, who has spoken with his client since the transfer, said in a statement on Monday that Mr. Combs is “committed to sobriety, focused on healing, and trying to set an example for others.” Representatives for the Bureau of Prisons could not immediately be reached to confirm his acceptance into the program.\n\nMr. Combs’s lawyers have said that he had abused drugs for years — including opiates for a time — but was able to get sober while in jail.\n\nAt Fort Dix, Mr. Combs has been sleeping in a nine-person room within a unit that houses about 200 people, Mr. Engelmayer said, and he currently works in the chapel library, assisting the clergy with various duties.\n\nAt his federal trial, there was extensive evidence introduced about his drug use. Federal agents who raided his mansion in Miami Beach, Fla., before his arrest recovered white powder that tested positive for cocaine and ketamine, along with pink MDMA tablets and different types of benzodiazepine pills.\n\nOn Friday, TMZ reported that Mr. Combs had been caught in prison drinking homemade alcohol, but Mr. Engelmayer denied the report in the statement.\n\nMr. Combs, who turned 56 last week, has been acclimating to life in Fort Dix, a low-security facility on a military base outside Philadelphia with an inmate population about 4,000 — the largest in the federal prison system. It was once home to high-profile inmates such as the former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli and George Jung, the cocaine smuggler portrayed by Johnny Depp in the 2001 movie “Blow.”\n\nThe drug abuse rehabilitation program to which Mr. Combs was admitted takes place in a residential treatment unit set apart from the general prison population. The Bureau of Prisons describes it as a half-day program rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy. (The rest of the day is devoted to “work, school, and other self improvement activities,” according to a Fort Dix inmate handbook.)\n\nJustin Paperny, who leads a prison consultancy called White Collar Advice and has clients in the drug program, said a place in the program is highly coveted because it can significantly curtail prison time. He said defendants often will be released to a halfway house or home confinement after the residential portion of the treatment, which typically lasts nine months, ends.\n\n“People try to do everything they can to get in,” Mr. Paperny said.\n\nMr. Combs once faced the possibility of life in prison on charges that he sex trafficked two of his girlfriends by coercing them into fetishistic sex marathons with male escorts, and ran a racketeering conspiracy staffed by loyal employees. During his eight-week trial, witnesses described an extensive pattern of violence, including repeated physical abuse of his longtime girlfriend, Casandra Ventura.\n\nBut the jury acquitted him of the most serious charges, and convicted him only of violations of the Mann Act, which makes it illegal to transport people across state lines for the purposes of prostitution. Mr. Combs is mounting an appeal of his conviction and sentence; his lawyers have argued that he was unfairly prosecuted for sex between consenting adults.\n\nWith its large prison yard, Fort Dix is in some ways less restrictive than the Brooklyn jail where Mr. Combs was detained starting shortly after his arrest in September 2024. At the jail, Mr. Combs had not “breathed fresh air” in a year, his lawyers said in court papers.\n\nShortly after his transfer, TMZ photographed Mr. Combs in the prison yard, smiling and chatting with other inmates in standard-issue gray sweats. Mr. Engelmayer said Mr. Combs celebrated his birthday last week at Fort Dix with cake and applesauce.\n\n“As long as you have money and don’t go around trying to act like a badass over there, you’ll be fine,” said Joe Giudice, who appeared in “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” and spent about a year and a half at Fort Dix starting in 2016 after pleading guilty to bankruptcy fraud. “It’s not easy, but you keep yourself busy.”\n\nThe prison at Fort Dix began to develop in the early 1990s, when the Pentagon and the bureau decided to convert an Army base that had been stripped of its function as an active-duty training center.\n\nThe inmates there now have access to televisions, exercise equipment and pool tables. The outdoor recreation area has a softball field, handball courts and bocce ball. In the commissary, Pop-Tarts are $2.85 for a pack and tablet computers — with content restrictions — go for $131.30. Inmates have the opportunity to teach classes on music or crafts such as leather work.\n\nMr. Combs’s lawyers have indicated that he may want to continue with a curriculum that he began teaching in the Brooklyn jail: a class known as “Free Game With Diddy” that is focused on business management and personal development.\n\nIn a letter to submitted ahead of his sentencing last month, Mr. Combs wrote to the judge overseeing his case that he had achieved sobriety for the first time in 25 years despite being “surrounded by drugs” at the Brooklyn jail. “I’m committed to the journey of remaining a drug free, nonviolent and peaceful person,” he wrote.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/briefing/congress-moves-to-end-the-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:58:13-05:00","title":"Congress Moves Closer to Ending the Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government is nearing the end of a 40-day shutdown, with Congress pushing to pass a funding bill that would restore federal operations through January.

week, as Congress moves closer to passing a funding bill.\n\nSenate Republicans are pushing for a vote tonight to fund most federal agencies through January. The shutdown would come to a close once that bill also passes the House and receives a signature from President Trump, which could happen by the middle of the week.\n\nThe 40-day logjam finally broke last night when eight senators in the Democratic caucus split with the party to strike a deal with Republicans. Their plan would reverse federal layoffs and ensure retroactive pay for furloughed workers, but it did not include Democrats’ central demand — the extension of Obamacare subsidies that are slated to expire at the end of the year.\n\nIn response, Democrats from nearly every ideological corner rebuked the reopening plan, which left them all but powerless in negotiations over health tax credits and other issues. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, described the deal as inadequate; Bernie Sanders called it a “policy and political disaster”; and even Stefany Shaheen, a congressional candidate whose mother was one of the Democrats who defected, criticized the plan.\n\nFlight troubles could continue until the shutdown officially ends.\n\nThe bill to reopen the government would allow senators to sue when federal investigators search their phone records without notifying them.\n\nThe president hosted an Oval Office meeting today with President Ahmed al-Shara of Syria, making him the first Syrian leader to be welcomed into the White House. Al-Shara has been drumming up international investment to aid his country’s recovery from a civil war, and Trump extended a sanctions waver on Syria.\n\nThe meeting was the latest turn in the extraordinary transformation of al-Shara, who was once designated as a terrorist by the U.S. with a $10 million bounty on his head. My colleague Roger Cohen traveled to Syria to trace al-Shara’s unlikely path.\n\nIn other Trump administration news:\n\nIn a largely symbolic move, the president pardoned Rudy Giuliani and others who tried to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nA felon who was freed by Trump was sentenced again after being accused of a range of criminal conduct.\n\nWhite House officials discussed naming the Washington Commanders’ new stadium after Trump.\n\nThe Supreme Court announced this morning that it had rejected a request to consider overturning its landmark 2015 decision to legalize same-sex marriage. That means that fewer than four justices voted to hear the case brought by a Kentucky county clerk who had refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses.\n\nIn related news:\n\nThe justices also said that they would hear a challenge to a Mississippi law that could upend mail-in ballot rules in many states before the midterms.\n\nThe court’s conservative majority seemed skeptical that a Rastafarian man could sue prison guards for shaving his dreadlocks.\n\nUnder Trump’s leadership, the U.S. has backed away from its efforts to rein in climate change. No American officials are attending the annual U.N. climate summit for the first time in 30 years. And European countries, too, have struggled to realize their green ambitions.\n\nIn that vacuum, China has emerged as the new renewable energy superpower. It is shaping some of the world’s fastest-growing economies by exporting cheap technology like solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nMilitary: Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, said that two U.S. strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean killed six people.\n\nMedia: Two top BBC executives quit after a former adviser said that the broadcaster had misleadingly edited a speech by Trump that preceded the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Trump threatened to sue for $1 billion.\n\nGambling: M.L.B. put a $200 cap on wagers for individual pitches after two Cleveland pitchers were charged with rigging bets.\n\nIntelligence: F.B.I. director Kash Patel is said to have made a promise at a secret meeting to M15, the U.K. intelligence service, and then to have broken it — adding to concerns from allies about his reliability.\n\nTexas: A lawsuit accused Camp Mystic, where two counselors and 25 campers died during July 4 floods, of gross negligence.\n\nMiddle East: Kenyan women who had babies out of wedlock while working in Saudi Arabia are banished to the edges of society and cannot leave the country.\n\nHealth: The F.D.A. will remove the black box warning from hormone replacement products containing estrogen.\n\nSouth Korea: This year, the country surpassed the U.S. to become the second-largest cosmetics exporter after France. Now one of its biggest brands is coming to America.\n\nCalifornia: Valentino Luchin, an acclaimed chef, robbed a Bay Area bank and served six months in jail. He blended back into the restaurant scene, until he robbed three more banks.\n\nDavid Szalay’s “Flesh” won this year’s Booker Prize, beating five other shortlisted titles, including the odds-on favorite, “The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny.”\n\nSzalay’s novel tells the story of Istvan, a lonely Hungarian teenager who makes an unexpected rise to the height of British society. Roddy Doyle, the chair of this year’s judging panel, called it a “singular” and “extraordinary” work. “It’s just not like any other book,” he said.\n\nFor centuries, inventors have tried to harness the power of evolution by studying the ingenious traits of plants and animals. Scientists call it bioinspiration.\n\nFor example, the knobs on whale flippers, which help them swim in tight circles, helped engineers come up with ideas for better wind turbine blades, ceiling fans and truck mirrors. Our science columnist Carl Zimmer highlighted more examples where bioinspiration came in handy.\n\nMillennial Baroness: Leonie von Ungern-Sternberg is trying to demystify what life as a modern noble is really like.\n\nBehind the scenes: Movement directors are often the secret ingredient to convincing physicality onscreen or down a runway.\n\nThe Divo of Juárez: Before Bad Bunny, the world had Juan Gabriel — who still draws huge crowds years after his death.\n\nHome branding: Does your house need a name?\n\nCook: This version of butter chicken is wildly luxurious.\n\nWatch: “Sincerely Saul” is one of our favorite horror movie picks this month.\n\nRead: “The Insider” is a well-reported look at Malcolm Cowley, who helped remake the U.S. literary canon.\n\nTravel: These floating hotels will rock you to sleep.\n\nConsider: How healthy are potatoes?

It’s a spongy mass that stretches for about 1,140 square feet, or about the size of a small home, and houses about 111,000 spiders.\n\nThe scientists who found the web were shocked to learn that it was jointly built by two different species of spider that had not been known to live together harmoniously, mainly because one tends to eat the other. “Because it’s dark in there,” one biologist said, “our hypothesis was that they do not see each other.”\n\nHave a cooperative evening.\n\nThanks for reading.

its status as having eliminated measles, the highly infectious virus that was considered wiped out in the country as of 1998, the federal health agency announced on Monday.\n\nWhile there have been some limited outbreaks in recent decades, the disease made a resurgence in October 2024. It took hold in several provinces and spread for more than 12 consecutive months, the threshold set by the World Health Organization for a country to lose its elimination status.\n\nCanada has logged more than 5,000 measles cases in the last year, with most of them reported in two provinces: Ontario, the most populous, with about 2,400 cases, and Alberta, with nearly 2,000 cases.\n\nA combination of falling vaccination rates and a collision between politics and public health policy in the post-pandemic era have contributed to Canada’s outbreak.\n\nAcross Canada, 79 percent of 7-year-olds were fully vaccinated against measles as of 2021, the most recent year for which data are available, down from 83 percent in 2019. That’s far lower than the 95 percent threshold that experts say is needed to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nThe highest concentration of cases in Canada has occurred in Alberta, a western province that has emphasized personal freedoms to reject vaccination.\n\nPoliticians and health officials clashed in April, when the province’s top doctor resigned just as the virus was gaining new footholds in Canada. An investigation by The New York Times found that at key points, health officials were stymied from ramping up measles messaging.\n\nCulturally conservative Mennonite communities have been a focus of the outbreak, according to Dr. Marina Salvadori, a pediatric infectious disease researcher and medical adviser to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Such groups historically have been less likely to accept vaccines, though the government has not provided precise demographic data on cases.\n\nThe virus has erupted in some other places with significant Mennonite communities, including West Texas and Chihuahua, Mexico.\n\nPublic health experts in Canada are concerned that measles is a harbinger for the return of other diseases, like polio, that were formerly concerned tamed.\n\n“Measles is the canary in the coal mine because of its phenomenal transmissibility,” said Dr. Brian Ward, a professor who studies infectious diseases at McGill University in Montreal.\n\nOnce one country loses its disease elimination status, the entire Americas region is also seen as having lost its status. The designation is made by an independent group of experts at the Pan American Health Organization, a regional office of the W.H.O. representing 35 countries in the Americas.\n\nA spokesman for the Canada’s health minister, Marjorie Michel, said she is “following the situation closely” and working with provincial health officials.\n\nIn response to the Times investigation of Alberta’s messaging on measles vaccines, Maddison McKee, a spokeswoman for the province’s health minister, noted that new cases had fallen to single digits in recent months.\n\n“Public health officials implemented targeted vaccination campaigns, expanded clinic hours and launched provincewide outreach,” Ms. McKee wrote in an email. “Since March, more than 130,000 measles vaccines have been administered across Alberta — a 50 percent increase compared to the same period last year.”\n\nTo regain its elimination status, Canada will have to show that it has had no endemic virus spread over 12 consecutive months.\n\nTo do that, public health experts say, Canada will have to increase the reach of vaccination.\n\n“It’s really the best tool in our arsenal to end an outbreak,” said Dr. Shelly Bolotin, the director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health.\n\nThe United States and Mexico have also experienced outbreaks that have sickened thousands of people over several months. Their elimination statuses are at risk if measles cases continue to spread within those countries a year after the initial outbreak.\n\nThe United States, which has reported over 1,600 cases, would reach that milestone in January and for Mexico, with over 4,000 cases, it would be in February.\n\nOther countries with active outbreaks are Belize, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay.\n\nIt can take several years for countries to regain their elimination status, said Dr. Alvaro Whittembury, an immunization expert at the Pan American Health Organization. He pointed to the example of Brazil, which lost its status in 2019, stopped the endemic spread in 2022, and regained its status in 2024.\n\nRebecca R. Ruiz contributed reporting from London.\n\n"}]}
