he’ll meet with NYC Mayor-elect Mamdani on Friday in the Oval Office \n       \n  By Donald Judd, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:27 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he plans to host New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani Friday in the Oval Office, the first face-to-face meeting for the two politicians since Mamdani was elected earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  “Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran ‘Kwame’ Mamdani, has asked for a meeting,” Trump wrote  on his Truth Social platform . “We have agreed that this meeting will take place at the Oval Office on Friday, November 21st. Further details to follow!”\n \n\n   \n  Dora Pekec, a spokesperson for the mayor-elect, confirmed the meeting in a statement, saying, “As is customary for an incoming mayoral administration, the Mayor-elect plans to meet with the President in Washington to discuss public safety, economic security and the affordability agenda that over one million New Yorkers voted for just two weeks ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before Trump announced the meeting, Mamdani confirmed his camp had reached out to arrange a meeting with the president in an interview with MS NOW.\n \n\n   \n  “We did reach out to the White House – and my team reached out because of a commitment that I made to New Yorkers, that I would be willing to meet with anyone and everyone, so long as it was to the benefit 8.5 million people who call the city home and their struggle to afford the most expensive city United States of America,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  A meeting between Trump and Mamdani would cap off months of acrimony between the two New Yorkers, who have traded barbs on the stump and in the press since Mamdani’s victory in the Democratic primary in June.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has used the Democratic Socialist Mamdani as a foil, seeking to link his politics to Democrats across the country and deriding him as “my little communist” in remarks from the Oval Office. He also threatened ahead of the election to take federal funding from New York City if Mamdani won.\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Mamdani directly addressed the president in his victory speech  moments after clinching the mayor’s race this month , joking, “Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.”\n \n\n   \n  Returning to the White House from his West Palm Beach home Sunday, Trump teased a meeting with Mamdani, telling reporters at Joint Base Andrews, “The mayor of New York, I will say, would like to meet with us, and we’ll work something out. But he, he would like to come to Washington and meet. And we’ll work something out. We want to see everything work out well for New York.”\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretches of the mayoral race, Trump had struck a far more antagonistic tone,  throwing his weight behind former Democratic governor and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo  in the hopes of stalling Mamdani’s momentum.\n \n\n   \n  “If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!” Trump wrote just two days before Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Previewing a potential meeting with Trump Wednesday, Mamdani told MS Now, “I want to just speak plainly to the president about what it means to actually stand up for New Yorkers and the way in which New Yorkers are struggling to afford this city, and frankly, cost of living is something that I heard time and time again from New Yorkers about why they voted for Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/larry-summers-openai-board-epstein","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-05:00","title":"Larry Summers leaves OpenAI board, Harvard instructor role as scrutiny over Epstein emails intensifies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, a former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president, has resigned from the OpenAI board and from his instructor role at Harvard following the release of emails showing years of personal correspondence with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Will he actually release them all? \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:56 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Both chambers of Congress passed legislation this week  forcing the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files , after President Donald Trump  capitulated  and blessed the bill. Trump said Wednesday night he had signed it.\n \n\n   \n  Now the question has quickly become: Will the Trump administration  actually release everything  the Justice Department has? Plenty of supporters of the legislation, including Republicans, have been quick to caution that this isn’t the end of the matter — that the White House might still have ways to get around that.\n \n\n   \n  “The real test will be: Will the Department of Justice release the files?” Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said Tuesday. “Or will it all remain tied up in investigations?”\n \n\n   \n  GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — the co-sponsor of the effort in the House to force a vote on the issue — has warned of a “last-ditch effort” by the administration to block the release of the files.\n \n\n   \n  These lawmakers have good reason to worry, based on the administration’s actions and comments. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday declined to provide assurances beyond saying the administration would “follow the law.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also difficult to see how the administration could not follow through with releasing the files — at least without risking yet another major political fiasco.\n \n\n   \n    The administration’s suspicious moves\n \n\n   \n  First, some background. There is a clear path for the administration to try and hold some documents back.\n \n\n   \n  It goes like this:\n \n\n   \n  That’s a very convenient progression of events if your goal is to try and withhold documents.\n \n\n   \n  Suddenly an investigation that was completely exhausted and needed to be closed has some supposedly juicy new leads that are worth pursuing. And this happens right at the time when Trump needs just such a pretext to keep avoiding full disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  There are certainly other reasons for Trump to want those investigations – including making it look like it’s  other  people (ones often associated with Democrats) who have Epstein problems, and not him. (Neither Trump nor the people he asked to be investigated have been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)\n \n\n   \n    The administration has played games on this before\n \n\n   \n  There are other reasons to be suspicious about how the administration might handle this.\n \n\n   \n  For one, it’s  already been  shown to be playing games  on Epstein disclosures.\n \n\n   \n  When the situation first blew up in its face in July, the administration’s first big effort to quell the backlash was to push for judges to release grand jury materials. But as plenty of experts quickly noted, that was unlikely to actually shed much light for a host of reasons.\n \n\n   \n  Sure enough, it did not shed much light. But not only that; two judges suggested the administration was proactively creating a “diversion.” One said the move appeared “ aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such .”\n \n\n   \n  Both noted the government had much more extensive information at its fingertips that it could release whenever it wanted to.\n \n\n   \n  Given this, it wouldn’t seem ridiculous to ask whether the administration might play games with whatever discretion it has — say, by releasing information that’s politically advantageous but withholding other information using the available justifications.\n \n\n   \n    Why Trump and Co. have said they didn’t want full disclosure\n \n\n   \n  And then there are the many things Trump and top officials have said warning about the dangers of full disclosure.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly cited the need to protect “innocent” people – not just victims, but also people whose names turn up in the documents who did nothing wrong. Just corresponding with Epstein, for example, would not be a crime.\n \n\n   \n  “You got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be,” Trump said in August, “because (Epstein) knew everybody in Palm Beach.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI’s July memo that announced it wouldn’t be releasing any new documents cited a desire “to protect victims” and “not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of illegal wrongdoing.”\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel in September testimony to Congress and elsewhere has suggested that part of the reason the administration has resisted full disclosure was to guard against releasing pornography. He also suggested that releasing more information could violate court orders.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to break the law to satisfy your curiosity,” Patel told a House Democrat.\n \n\n   \n  And House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday argued that the Epstein bill could hurt people whose “names may be in these files, and they had nothing to do with this.” The Louisiana Republican also made an impassioned case that the bill did not adequately prevent the release of child sexual abuse material, despite a clause intended to do that.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson ultimately voted for the bill, saying he hoped the Senate would amend it. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune apparently didn’t share his concerns, allowing the bill to pass by unanimous consent without amendment.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of this — and given Trump’s clear reluctance for months to grant such disclosure, right  up until the moment the battle appeared lost  — you could see how the administration might want to at least preserve its options.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Sunday that Congress “can have whatever they are legally entitled to,” but the phrase “legally entitled to” certainly looms large, for the reasons mentioned above.\n \n\n   \n    But not releasing would be a huge risk\n \n\n   \n  Even if the administration is reserving its options or intends to withhold significant documents, it’s hard to see how doing that could pass muster politically.\n \n\n   \n  For one, the legislation requires the withholding of documents related to active investigations to be “narrowly tailored and temporary.” Trump has more than three years remaining in his presidency; it’s difficult to see the administration withholding significant information for that long citing active investigations.\n \n\n   \n  For another, anything that’s redacted or withheld must include a written justification, and the administration must notify Congress about these categories of documents within 15 days. The legislation also requires the administration to give Congress an unredacted “list of all government officials and politically exposed persons” included in the materials.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, it could be pretty easy to piece together if the administration is hiding extensive amounts of information. What’s more, attempting to do that could risk an even bigger backlash than the administration has already seen, from even its own base.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean the administration wouldn’t  attempt  to withhold documents. Its handling of this matter  has been baffling  throughout.\n \n\n   \n  But if it did, that would be among the most desperate and politically risky things the administration has done — and at a time when it can’t really keep taking such hits.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/nancy-mace-cory-mills-censure","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:39:00.000Z","title":"House Refers Nancy Mace’s Censure Motion Against Cory Mills to Ethics Committee","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant move to uphold ethical standards, House Republicans led by Nancy Mace filed a resolution to censure Florida Representative Cory Mills, citing multiple allegations including assault, false claims about military service, federal contract violations, and incomplete financial disclosures.

the chamber’s Ethics Committee, beating back an effort to swiftly remove him from his committee assignments.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers voted 310-103 to send GOP Rep. Nancy Mace’s complaint against Florida Rep. Cory Mills to the committee, staving off another vote on the matter later this week. Mills had moved to refer it to the panel.\n \n\n   \n  The House Ethics committee revealed separately on Wednesday it voted to  establish  an investigative subcommittee to probe the various allegations that Mills is facing.\n \n\n   \n  Mace announced earlier in the day that she would seek to censure the Florida congressman and remove him from the House Armed Services and House Foreign Affairs committees, pointing to several controversies surrounding him. Though ultimately unsuccessful, seven Republicans – Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Anna Paulina Luna, Lauren Boebert, Harriet Hageman, Tim Burchett, Kat Cammack and Joe Wilson – joined with Mace to move it forward.\n \n\n   \n  Once considered rare in the House chamber, censure has been  used more frequently  in recent years and amounts to a significant rebuke of a member of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The congresswoman’s attempt to reprimand Mills comes after House Democrats on Tuesday night  abandoned a separate censure measure  against the Florida Republican after a GOP effort to censure Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett failed.\n \n\n   \n  Mills said in  a statement  Wednesday that there was no deal between lawmakers leading Democrats to pull the Tuesday resolution and that he and his team were surprised by the move.\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be perfectly clear, there was no backroom deal, no negotiation, and no quid pro quo of any kind that would’ve forced the Democrats to stand down on that vote against me.

The resolution also  mentions a judge’s order  that Mills is not to have any contact with that ex-girlfriend. Mills has denied any wrongdoing in both matters.\n \n\n   \n  Mace’s resolution also points to the  Office of Congressional Ethics’ findings  that Mills may have entered into or held contracts with federal agencies while serving as a member of Congress, which is in violation of House rules. It also cites the ethics office’s finding that Mills may have omitted required information in his financial disclosure statements and accepted excessive contributions to his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “These allegations are far too serious to ignore,” Mace said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “A member of Congress accused of assaulting women, profiting off federal contracts from his seat, and inflating or falsifying his service record has no business anywhere near national-security committees.

potentially deadly botulism in babies who drank ByHeart infant formula continue to grow, state officials say they are still finding the  recalled product  on some store shelves.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile the company reported late Wednesday that laboratory tests confirmed that some samples of formula were contaminated with the type of bacteria that has sickened more than 30 babies in the outbreak.\n \n\n   \n  Tests by an independent food safety laboratory found Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that produces toxins that can lead to potentially life threatening illness in babies younger than 1, the company said on its website. ByHeart officials said they notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the findings but did not specify how many samples were tested or how many were positive.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working to investigate the facts, conduct ongoing testing to identify the source, and ensure this does not happen to families again,” ByHeart said on its website.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA did not immediately respond to questions about the findings.\n \n\n   \n  The lab results come as investigators in at least three states found ByHeart formula still for sale even after the New York-based company recalled all products nationwide, officials told The Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  At least 31 babies in 15 states who drank ByHeart formula have been hospitalized and treated for infantile botulism since August,  federal health officials said Wednesday.  They range in age from about 2 weeks to about 6 months, with the most recent case reported on Nov. 13.\n \n\n   \n  No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  In Oregon, nine of more than 150 stores checked still had the formula on shelves this week, a state agriculture official said.

An Arizona health official also said they found the product available.\n \n\n   \n  Businesses and consumers should remain alert, Minnesota officials said in a statement. “No affected product should be sold or consumed,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted inspections at ByHeart manufacturing plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon. No results from the inspections have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  California officials previously confirmed the germ that can lead to illness in an open can of ByHeart formula fed to a baby who fell ill.\n \n\n   \n   Infant botulism,  which can cause paralysis and death, is caused by a type of bacteria that forms spores that germinate in a baby’s gut and produce a toxin.\n \n\n   \n  Symptoms can take up to 30 days to develop and include constipation, poor feeding, a weak cry, drooping eyelids or a flat facial expression. Babies can develop weakness in their limbs and head and may feel “floppy.” They can have trouble swallowing or breathing.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart had been manufacturing about 200,000 cans of formula per month. It was sold online or at retail stores such as Target and Walmart.

unanimously moved to repeal a controversial provision in the government funding law that allows senators to sue the Justice Department for up to $500,000 when their phone records are seized without their knowledge.\n \n\n   \n  The provision, included in the legislation that ended the historic shutdown, requires senators be notified when federal investigators access their phone records, with some exceptions. If they’re not notified, the lawmakers can sue the federal government for up to $500,000 in damages for each violation.\n \n\n   \n  House members publicly wary of the measure voted 426-0 to nullify the provision. But its future remains in doubt in the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune had added it to the bill at the request of several members of his conference.\n \n\n   \n   Tucked into one of the appropriations bills , the language comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called “Arctic Frost,” which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Donald Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register Electoral College votes for Trump from states that former President Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  It’s caused bipartisan furor on Capitol Hill and spotlighted a rare divide between the top Republican leaders. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was blindsided by the measure, while Thune has resolutely stood behind it.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re striking the provision as fast as we can, and we expect the Senate to move it,” Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN Tuesday. “We believe there’s a fairly sizable growing majority over there that believes that they should strike it.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of the senators whose phone records were seized as part of Arctic Frost have tried to distance themselves from the legislation and  say they won’t seek  monetary damages.\n \n\n   \n  Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley called it a “bad idea.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m all for accountability. I mean, I had my phone tapped, so I’m all for accountability, don’t get me wrong, but I just, I think taking taxpayer money is not the way to do it. The way to do it is tough oversight,” he told reporters earlier Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for another member, Sen. Dan Sullivan, told CNN last week he does not plan on suing and is supportive of the House effort to repeal the provision.\n \n\n   \n  But at least one targeted senator is looking to reap gains.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday said he plans on suing DOJ in his case for “far more” than $500,000, and advocated for expanding the measure to include private citizens.\n \n\n   \n  “You want to make sure that people who are going to issue subpoenas in the future against private citizens to get their phone records without a court order, I mean, without a warrant, have to think twice, and if the government doesn’t pay, you’re going to get more of this,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mike Rounds, who was not one of the senators swept in Arctic Frost, explained that the measure was meant to “send a message to the administration that this can’t happen” in the wake of the news of then-special counsel Jack Smith’s subpoenas, though he predicted that many GOP senators would be “open for a reconsideration” depending on how the House approaches the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Steve Daines, a Thune ally, said he doesn’t think House’s measure could pass the Senate, arguing that Smith’s move to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers with grand jury subpoenas in his January 6 investigation was a “massive overreach.”\n \n\n   \n  “My name is not on the list, so I don’t benefit from this. This seems to be a strong pushback. I think the provision that Leader Thune put in there was appropriate, and I stand by his leadership,” he added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/brian-walshe-guilty-plea-legal-defense","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:33:00-20:33","title":"Brian Walshe Pleads Guilty to Body Disposal in Wife’s Disappearance Case, But Denies Murder","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brian Walshe, a Massachusetts man, has pleaded guilty to misleading police and illegally disposing of his wife Ana Walshe’s body, but continues to deny any involvement in her murder.

Here’s what that could mean for his murder trial \n       \n  By Lauren del Valle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:33 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Massachusetts man on trial for murdering his wife in 2023 admitted this week that he disposed of her body in dumpsters and misled police, but his lawyers insist he is not admitting to her murder.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with attorneys still working to empanel the jury that will consider the murder charge still haunting him, the question becomes: How will  Brian Walshe’s  legal team defend him?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, minutes before jury selection was set to begin for his murder trial, Walshe pleaded guilty to misleading police and the improper conveyance – or illegal disposal – of a human body stemming from the death of his wife, Ana Walshe. The   corporate real estate manager and mother of three  vanished around New Year’s 2023 .\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a deal with prosecutors, who “refuse to negotiate,” according to a defense filing, “unless negotiations included the indictment charging murder.”\n \n\n   \n  Walshe still faces one count of first-degree murder, which, if convicted, carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  The eleventh-hour guilty pleas Tuesday came as a shock – and piqued interest in Walshe’s defense strategy.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to have Walshe plead guilty to those charges is an “incredibly bold move by the defense,” said Ronald Sullivan, a Harvard law professor, and will allow the defense to focus the trial solely on the question of whether the defendant killed his wife, potentially limiting what evidence the jury will see about Walshe’s disposal of Ana’s remains.\n \n\n   \n  “It may well be a good strategic move for the defense,” said Sullivan.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible Walshe’s attorneys are maneuvering for their client to face lesser homicide charges in the hopes of avoiding life without parole.\n \n\n   \n  Under Massachusetts law, Walshe cannot plead guilty to first-degree murder, so the commonwealth would have to change course and agree to Walshe pleading guilty to a lesser homicide charge like second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, which could allow for the possibility of parole.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, Walshe’s attorneys have made clear he isn’t admitting to Ana’s murder, despite his change of pleas.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe is prepared to admit to the recitation of facts with respect to the indictment that the government just read in so far as it alleges he did impede and obstruct the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Ana Walshe. We obviously object, and he’s not admitting to … murder,” defense attorney Kelli Porges said in court Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Jury selection continues Thursday. Judge Diane Freniere has ordered the chosen panelists to stay off social media and avoid the news to reduce their risk of exposure to coverage of Walshe’s case.\n \n\n   \n    How we got here\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, sparking a search that drew national media attention. When local police went to the Walshe home, Brian Walshe told officers his wife had left early New Year’s Day to return to Washington, DC for a work emergency, and he hadn’t seen or heard from her since.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe, who lived and worked in DC, commuted to the Boston suburbs to see her family on December 30, 2022. Her former boss joined the family to celebrate on New Year’s Eve around 8 p.m. and told authorities he left around 1 a.m. the following day.\n \n\n   \n  The guest didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, and told authorities the couple seemed happy, according to court records. He is expected to testify at trial.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe reportedly called Ana’s employer, Tishman Speyer, on January 4, 2023, asking about his wife, court records say, but he never reported her missing to the police.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe was arrested on January 8, 2023, for misleading police in connection to Ana’s disappearance. He was charged with her murder later that month, and he has been in commonwealth custody since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was originally slated to begin last month, on October 20. But Judge Freniere granted a delay for Walshe to undergo a mental health evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys lobbied for the delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concern their client could not adequately assist in his defense following the attack. He was deemed competent to stand trial last week after a 40-day stint in a state hospital.\n \n\n   \n    Possible defense strategies\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s defense team has kept its strategy close to the vest, rarely commenting in the media about the case since his arrest almost three years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Following his guilty pleas Tuesday, Walshe faces up to 10 years in prison for the charge of misleading police – which could be enhanced up to 20 years if he is convicted of Ana’s murder. He also faces up to three years in prison for pleading guilty to the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, Walshe is serving a 37-month prison sentence tied to a federal case from 2018, in which Walshe pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. That sentence is set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe faces a charge of first-degree murder for Ana’s death. But before the jury begins deliberating, his attorneys could ask the judge to allow the panel to consider less severe homicide charges.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the judge would not grant the request, Sullivan said. But she would consider “if there are enough facts to support something, or the absence of contradictory facts – like nobody was there.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe and their three young children are the only people said to have been in their home after ringing in the New Year. At this point, there is no publicly released evidence to suggest how Ana Walshe died. Her body  has not been found .\n \n\n   \n  The success of the defense case could hinge on testimony by Walshe himself, who could take the stand to offer the jury a narrative of what happened after their dinner guest left around 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day. For example, his lawyers could claim Walshe is innocent of murder because a terrible accident caused Ana’s death, or provide some justification to support a theory that Walshe caused her death in self-defense.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem with these sorts of defenses is that there’s no corroboration, and the alleged victim is unable to say anything, because the person is deceased,” said Sullivan, who was on the defense team that secured an acquittal in the 2017 double homicide case against one-time NFL player Aaron Hernandez.\n \n\n   \n  “If he testifies and says, ‘We got into an argument, you know, she pulled a knife on me, and I defended myself,’ he gets to testify to that because there are no contrary facts there,” he said. “And, you know, no one else was around, and that’s the evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jury can credit it or not credit it,” Sullivan added, “but that’s on the record at this point.”\n \n\n   \n    What we might see at trial\n \n\n   \n  Sullivan indicated Walshe’s guilty pleas this week for misleading the police and improper conveyance of a body suggested the defense felt the evidence against their client was substantial.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re saying, ‘We will eat everything for which there’s such overwhelming evidence … We’re not going to win that fight so let’s just say we did it,’” Sullivan said, channeling the defense’s possible perspective.\n \n\n   \n  “Now all (they’re) fighting over is whether the defendant caused the death of the decedent,” Sullivan said. “So, one thing instead of several things.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Walshe changed his plea on two of the three counts in the indictment, prosecutors had said they could call up to 60 witnesses in the commonwealth’s case against him. But the commonwealth’s witness list will likely be trimmed down now that prosecutors don’t need to establish that Walshe disposed of his wife’s body and belongings or that he lied about his activities in the days after her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors will likely show the jury some evidence of Walshe’s activities in the days after he claims he last saw his wife – but less than what would have been necessary to prove the charges to which he’s now pleaded guilty.\n \n\n   \n  “What the judge will likely do is say, ‘Well, some of that will come in because it goes to your state of mind,’ and the jury can reasonably infer consciousness of guilt from some of these actions,” Sullivan said.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, records and video surveillance put Walshe at Lowe’s and Home Depot on January 1 and 2, 2023, buying a bevy of cleaning supplies with cash. Walshe was also seen on video surveillance throwing several black bags into dumpsters.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators searched a dumpster at the complex where Walshe’s mother lived and recovered a number of items, including a Tyvek suit, a hatchet, a hacksaw and several items with  Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood  and DNA on them. They also found some of Ana’s belongings, including her Hunter boots, a Prada purse and her Covid-19 vaccination card.\n \n\n   \n  Ana’s blood was also found in the basement of the Walshe family home.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, prosecutors have alleged Walshe used his 6-year-old son’s iPad for  dozens of Google searches  on the morning of January 1, 2023, like, “How to get blood out of hardwood floors,” “how to dispose of a body in the trash” and “how to stop a body from decomposing.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have suggested Walshe had a financial motive to kill his wife, to cash in on life insurance policies that would help him pay restitution tied to his federal art fraud conviction.\n \n\n   \n  They have also said it’s fair to assume Walshe knew his wife was  having an affair  with a man in Washington, DC and suggested he could have been motivated to kill her because of the romantic entanglement. The jury is expected to see text messages between Ana and the man, who is also expected to testify.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorneys argue there is no proof he knew about the affair before Ana’s disappearance. But prosecutors say Walshe Googled the man days before Ana vanished.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/entertainment/jonathan-joss-murder-texas-man-indicted","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00-05:00","title":"Texas man indicted on murder charge in shooting of ‘King of the Hill’ voice actor Jonathan Joss","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A grand jury in Texas has indicted Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, 57, on a murder charge for the killing of Jonathan Joss, a well-known voice actor behind the character John Redcorn on 'King of the Hill' and a recurring role on 'Parks and Recreation'.

voice actor  Jonathan Joss  on a murder charge.\n \n\n   \n  But it is unclear whether Joss’ killing will be considered a hate crime. Police in San Antonio did not immediately return an email seeking comment Wednesday on whether its investigation had determined that Joss’  sexual orientation  played a role in his shooting, and the Bexar County District Attorney’s Office declined to comment on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Police allege Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, 57,  confronted Joss  and his husband on June 1 as they were checking their mail at their San Antonio home, which had been burned down in January.\n \n\n   \n  Joss’ husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, has claimed the person who killed the actor yelled “violent homophobic slurs” before opening fire.\n \n\n   \n  Ceja Alvarez’s attorneys did not immediately return emails seeking comment Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In June, Alfonso Otero, one of Ceja Alvarez’s attorneys, said his client was innocent and denied making any homophobic statements.\n \n\n   \n  The grand jury returned the indictment Monday, and Ceja Alvarez remains free on a $200,000 bond.\n \n\n   \n  A friend of the 59-year-old Joss has said that Joss and Ceja Alvarez were neighbors and the two had argued for years.\n \n\n   \n  Initially, San Antonio police had said there was no evidence indicating the shooting was related to Joss’ sexual orientation. But San Antonio Police Chief William McManus later walked back that statement, saying it had been “premature” and that whether Joss’ sexual orientation played a role in the shooting was “part of the investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  The district attorney’s office said in a statement Wednesday that Ceja Alvarez “is charged with murder, which is the most serious charge applicable to this crime under Texas law. As the case is still pending, no additional details or information can be released at this time.”\n \n\n   \n  Under Texas law, a hate crime — if there’s a conviction — would be handled as an enhancement during sentencing and not as a separate charge.\n \n\n   \n  Joss was the voice of John Redcorn, a Native American character on the popular “King of the Hill” animated series, which ran for 13 seasons from 1997 to 2008. A reboot of the show, which Joss had already worked on, premiered in August.\n \n\n   \n  Joss also had a recurring role on the television show “Parks and Recreation,” playing Chief Ken Hotate. He appeared in two episodes of the series “Tulsa King” in 2022.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/russia-ukraine-white-house-plan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"10:45:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration quietly attempting to hammer out new peace plan with Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is quietly advancing a new peace plan with Russia to end the war in Ukraine, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and supported by a Pentagon delegation including Army Secretary Dan Driscoll.

     10:45 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has been quietly hammering out a new peace plan with Russia to end its war with Ukraine, a person familiar with the talks told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who has been at the center of the  administration’s talks with Moscow , has been leading the effort, the source said. The negotiations accelerated this week as the administration feels the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal, the source added.\n \n\n   \n  Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and a top-level Pentagon delegation arrived this morning in Ukraine “on a fact finding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,” Army Spokesperson Col. Dave Butler said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The mission, at the direction of the president, was part of the White House effort to resuscitate peace talks, according to a separate source who is a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll was expected to discuss battlefield conditions and weapons needs with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian officials, as well as the nascent peace efforts, the official said.\n \n\n   \n   The Wall Street Journal  first reported on the US delegation traveling to Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on Telegram, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote that he had the honor of meeting with Driscoll, posting a photo of the two men shaking hands.\n \n\n   \n  Shmyhal expressed “gratitude” to the US for its “important support that saves the lives of Ukrainians every day.” He added that he “presented to partners our developments in the field of defense innovations” and “focused on the next steps to implement the historic defense agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Driscoll has not been publicly involved in the last rounds of peace talks, but he is a close ally of Vice President JD Vance, with whom he attended Yale Law School. He has focused on military acquisitions.\n \n\n   \n  Other officials traveling with Driscoll to Kyiv were Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George; Gen. Chris Donahue, the top US Army commander in Europe; and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Weimer.\n \n\n   \n  Russian sources also confirmed to CNN that there are ongoing high-level contacts between US and Russian officials, including Witkoff.\n \n\n   \n  Russian Special Envoy  Kirill Dmitriev went to the US in October  to meet Witkoff and others and had what a Russian source told CNN were “very productive discussions.”\n \n\n   \n  According to an  Axios report , the current draft being hashed out between Washington and Moscow is focused on 28 points, including security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe, as well as future US relations with Russia and Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin on Wednesday downplayed the Axios report. When asked about it, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that there are “no new developments to report so far” regarding an end to the war.\n \n\n   \n  “There were discussions in Anchorage. Beyond what was discussed in Anchorage, there have been no updates yet,” he said, referencing a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump in Alaska in August.\n \n\n   \n  Europe and Ukraine’s involvement in the talks so far remains unclear, the source familiar said, as well as whether they would support such a plan.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a social media post Wednesday evening indicated that the Trump administration is in communication with both Kyiv and Moscow to come up with ideas for possible peace plans.\n \n\n   \n  “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” he said on X, noting that a lasting peace would also require difficult concessions from both sides. “That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House declined to respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The discussions come as the Trump administration has tried repeatedly to find an end to the war, only for talks to fall apart after Putin refused to make substantial commitments to the effort.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought that was going to be my easy one, because I have a good relationship with President Putin, but I’m a little disappointed in President Putin right now,” Trump said during remarks at a US-Saudi investment conference Wednesday. “He knows that.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump  spoke with Putin by phone last month , he was so convinced there was enough progress made that he announced would soon be traveling to Budapest for an in-person summit with the Russian leader.\n \n\n   \n  But just five days later, the  summit was off  and  new sanctions on Moscow  — the first of Trump’s second administration — were on.\n \n\n   \n  US officials told CNN that in the time between, the president and his administration came to the conclusion that Putin’s stance on ending the war had not significantly shifted from the last time he  met Trump on a US air base in Alaska .\n \n\n   \n  Previous US peace talks had focused on freezing Russian and Ukrainian troops along current battle lines. Europe and Ukraine backed the plan as a jumping off point for fresh negotiations, while the Kremlin rejected the proposal, arguing they were not interested in a ceasefire but a longer-term peace deal.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/harvard-launch-investigation-summers-epstein-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"10:29:00-05:00","title":"Former Harvard President Larry Summers Steps Aside From Teaching as University Probes Jeffrey Epstein Documents","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, former president of Harvard University and a prominent figure in U.S. economic policy, has stepped away from his role as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard Kennedy School, effective immediately, amid a university investigation into personal emails between him and Jeffrey Epstein.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former Harvard president Larry Summers will not finish out the semester in his instructor role, a Harvard spokesperson confirmed, as the university investigates emails from Jeffrey Epstein released last week.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Summers has decided it’s in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review,” Summers spokesperson Steven Goldberg told the Associated Press. “His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester.” CNN has reached out to Summers for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Summers has served as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School since 2011.\n \n\n   \n  Summers had announced earlier Wednesday he  resigned from the OpenAI board  as he steps away from his public commitments following the release of the Epstein emails.\n \n\n   \n  The Harvard investigation and Summers’ departure from the university and the OpenAI board come after a trove of emails was  released last week  that included years of personal correspondence between the two men.\n \n\n   \n  “The University is conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted,” a Harvard spokesperson told CNN, and said Summers had communicated his decision to the university.\n \n\n   \n  The Harvard Crimson  first reported the story  of Summers’ early departure and the  university’s investigation .\n \n\n   \n  The Crimson reported the investigation will also examine the roles of other people associated with the university who are implicated in the tens of thousands of pages released by the House Oversight Committee — including Summers’ wife, a  professor emerita  of American literature at Harvard, and nearly a dozen current and former Harvard affiliates.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said in a statement Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Summers served as Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary and Barack Obama’s director of the National Economic Council and was  president  of Harvard from 2001 to 2006.\n \n\n   \n  He resigned as the school’s president amid multiple controversies, including his suggestion that men may perform better in the sciences because of genetic differences from women. He  currently serves  as the Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard.\n \n\n   \n  A previous investigation conducted by Harvard into its ties to Epstein revealed the multimillionaire, who  died by suicide  in jail while awaiting trial on charges accusing him of sexually abusing underage girls and running a sex trafficking ring, donated $9.1 million to the university between 1998 and 2008.\n \n\n   \n  No donations were received after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida of one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, according to a 2020  statement  from then-Harvard President Larry Bacow.\n \n\n   \n  The emails released last week  include  numerous exchanges between Summers and Epstein dating from at least 2013 to 2019, which include Summers making sexist comments and seeking Epstein’s romantic advice.\n \n\n   \n  Congress   on Tuesday  approved  a measure requiring the Justice Department to release all of its investigative files on Epstein within 30 days. The Senate unanimously agreed to pass the House-backed bill, meaning the measure will be sent to President Donald Trump, who has said he’d sign the legislation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/sport/football-nfl-kris-boyd-jets-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:26:00-05:00","title":"Jets Cornerback Kris Boyd Started Breathing on His Own After Being Shot in Manhattan","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kris Boyd, a cornerback for the New York Jets, was shot in the abdomen in midtown Manhattan on Sunday, November 16, 2025, shortly after 2 a.m. He was transported to Bellevue Hospital, where he was initially in critical but stable condition.

feature a picture of the special teams standout lying down and smiling in what appears to be his hospital bed, with the words “God is real, God is powerful” at the top of the image.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m sorry I have no words at the moment,” Boyd wrote. “Just grateful! I’m coming along, starting to breathe on my own now. Sincerely appreciate everyone!”\n \n\n   \n  The post came a few hours after Jets coach Aaron Glenn said he had spoken to Boyd and is confident Boyd will be OK. He added that Boyd was “upbeat” in their recent conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s what eases my mind, is that he’s in good spirits,” Glenn said. “His wife and his kid, they’re in good spirits and he will walk away from this just fine.”\n \n\n   \n  Glenn was unsure when Boyd might be released from the hospital, where he has been listed in critical but stable condition.\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t know just yet,” the coach said. “But I will say this, just talking to him, he felt really upbeat. And again, that’s what gives me comfort, that he feels like that and he’s talking that way.”\n \n\n   \n  New York police released surveillance images Monday of a man sought in the shooting of Boyd. A motive for the shooting remains under investigation and authorities said it’s not clear if Boyd was targeted by the shooter. No other injuries were reported.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting happened just after 2 a.m. Sunday about halfway between Madison Square Garden and Times Square. Boyd, 29, was taken to Bellevue Hospital after being shot in the abdomen, police said. The shooter fled the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Glenn said Boyd has been on his mind “a ton” since he heard about the shooting. The coach said Boyd and his wife recently welcomed a baby.\n \n\n   \n  “The first thing I thought about, he just had a kid,” Glenn said. “And I’m thinking about his wife, I’m thinking about his kid and I want to make sure that he’s OK. And that’s the only thing that really went through my mind. …\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a process to this, which I won’t get into, but I’m happy at the fact that he’s going to come out of this thing really, really well.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd hasn’t played this season, his first with the Jets, after going on the season-ending injured reserve list on Aug. 18 with a shoulder injury that required surgery to repair.\n \n\n   \n  He signed with New York as a free agent in March and was expected to be a key part of a revamped special teams unit under Glenn and special teams coordinator Chris Banjo. But Boyd was injured during a training camp practice Aug. 2 and carted from the field.\n \n\n   \n  Boyd has remained around the team throughout the season while recovering from the shoulder injury.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s been a part of what we’re doing,” Glenn said. “I mean, he comes to the games all the time.

     7:21 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A US appeals court has temporarily blocked an order curtailing federal immigration enforcement in Chicago, arguing the lower court judge overstepped when she imposed strict and wide-reaching restraints on how agents can interact with protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n  A three-judge panel for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to pause the order issued by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  In an incremental victory for the Trump administration, the appeals panel concluded  Ellis’s order  was “too prescriptive,” writing in their decision that she is “impermissibly infringing” on the separation of powers between the executive branch and the courts.\n \n\n   \n  This is yet another twist in what has been a tense legal showdown in Chicago between the administration — which desires wide latitude to use force on protesters who it says are violently hindering its immigration agents — and the judge — who has expressed deep skepticism over the government’s presentation of the facts in court.\n \n\n   \n  For months, plaintiffs’ attorneys have complained to Ellis that federal agents have indiscriminately and without warning used chemical agents and other riot control measures against protesters — including members of the clergy — and reporters.\n \n\n   \n   Ellis’ order , issued November 6, prohibited several methods of force, including pulling or shoving; required federal agents to give warnings before deploying tear gas or other riot control weapons; and stipulated that almost all agents must wear clear identification and body cameras.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also ordered the government to turn over extensive use-of-force records and other internal records.\n \n\n   \n  But the appeals panel criticized the scope of Ellis’ order, saying it is so detailed it “resembled federal regulation.” They wrote that the order is so sweeping, it applies to almost any law enforcement personnel within the executive branch.\n \n\n   \n  “The district court’s order enjoins an expansive range of defendants, including the President of the United States, the entire Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, and anyone acting in concert with them,” the panel wrote in its decision.\n \n\n   \n  The order comes one day before Ellis is set to issue her written opinion in the case that has required a high-level Border Patrol agent, Greg Bovino, to  appear before her  in a downtown Chicago federal courtroom.\n \n\n   \n  However, the pause of Ellis’ order is only temporary as it considers the Trump administration’s larger appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “Do not overread today’s order,” the judges wrote, noting that they have a ream of facts to consider. “Those findings may support entry of a more tailored and appropriate preliminary injunction that directly addresses the First and Fourth Amendment claims raised by these plaintiffs.”\n \n\n   \n  At times, Ellis has chided ICE officials and federal attorneys in open court, saying their statements often “lack credibility.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge expressed particular skepticism over a confrontation between federal agents and protesters in which DHS said use of force was justified because Bovino was hit in the head with a rock thrown by a demonstrator. Video did not support the claim and “ defendant Bovino admitted that he lied ,” the judge said.\n \n\n   \n  In its written decision, the appeals panel appeared to question whether the plaintiffs suing the Trump administration still have a strong enough claim, as the federal presence in Chicago has tapered off while federal agents  flood into Charlotte, North Carolina, and prepare to enter New Orleans .\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration is battling on multiple legal fronts as it attempts to carry out what it hopes will be a history-making national immigration crackdown. As federal agents have rounded up thousands of migrants across  Tennessee, California, Oregon, Illinois and other states, it has been met with a wall of lawsuits from protesters, detainees and state and local governments who object to its escalating tactics.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/cherfilus-mccormick-indicted-fema-funds-theft","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:59:00-05:00","title":"Rep.

Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:45 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US House Ways and Means Committee said Wednesday that it is investigating the organ procurement organization for the New Jersey region for what it called “extreme abuse of public trust” and possible illegal activity, including trying to procure organs from people who didn’t volunteer to be donors and, in at least one case, trying to continue with the organ recovery process in a patient who had “reanimated.”\n \n\n   \n  The allegations were discussed in a letter the committee sent to the New Jersey Organ and Tissue Sharing Network, one of 55 organ procurement organizations that are federally designated nonprofits tasked with the multibillion-dollar business of managing the recovery of organs for transplantation in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The committee, which has investigated several organ procurement organizations over what the lawmakers say is behavior considered unacceptable, says it has been asking the New Jersey network for records and information at least since July.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators spoke with nearly a dozen whistleblowers, the letter says. One of the incidents it highlights involves an unnamed patient at the Virtua Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. The patient was pronounced dead and the network started the process to recover their organs, the letter says, but soon after the recovery process began, the person “reanimated.”\n \n\n   \n  The procurement team called the network’s chief executive officer to find out what to do. Witnesses told the committee that the CEO instructed the NJTO staff on site to “proceed with recovery,” according to the letter. “However, hospital staff intervened, and recovery did not move forward.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the hospital nor the procurement organization responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The committee described the case as “shocking” and “alarming” and said several whistleblowers told investigators that documents with regard to details about the case were deleted or manipulated.\n \n\n   \n  The committee’s letter also alleges that the New Jersey Sharing Network misused documents to tell patients’ families it had authority to remove organs, even if the patient was not currently listed as an organ donor on their driver’s license or, in some cases, had withdrawn their permission to donate; may have procured and thrown out hundreds of organs just to meet federal metrics; and gave organs to people out of sequence on the transplant list.\n \n\n   \n  “This is unacceptable,” the letter says. “The organs procured by every [organ procurement organization] across the country belong to the individuals on the waitlist who are ranked and matched using medical criteria. They do not belong to the OPOs, and it is not NJTO’s role to pick winners and losers on the transplant waiting list.”\n \n\n   \n  The letter also says the organization has made misleading statements to Congress throughout the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “These allegations raise questions about whether NJTO should keep its tax-exempt status and highlights the need for potential legislative reforms,” the letter says.\n \n\n   \n  The House Ways and Means Committee has asked the New Jersey organization to send additional documents including any complaints it has received, documents from the head of the organization and staff communications, as well as any more unredacted documents related to the patient in the Camden case.\n \n\n   \n  The letter is the latest development in the committee’s focus on the nation’s organ procurement groups.\n \n\n   \n  In July,  the committee sent a letter  to the Indiana Donor Network with regard to its use of private jets for non-mission charter flights. It also demanded documents from the Miami-area Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, and  after its investigation , the US Department of Health and Human Services moved to decertify the organization – essentially shutting the operation down – in September.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation found unsafe practices, staff shortages and paperwork errors,  according to HHS . Agency Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the time that the move was meant as a “clear warning” to other donor organizations.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee sent a letter to the Network for Hope, a Kentucky-based organ procurement organization, that demanded documents related to practices it considered unsafe.\n \n\n   \n   In one case  four years ago in Richmond, Kentucky, a man says he woke up on the operating table while a recovery team was shaving his chest to take his organs.\n \n\n   \n  Witnesses say the hospital staffers were pressured by people within the organization to continue with the procedure, but a local surgeon refused to continue the operation when she saw that the man wasn’t dead. The Kentucky Attorney General’s Office has also been investigating the case.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/veteran-fbi-employee-sues-fired-pride-flag","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00-05:00","title":"Veteran FBI employee sues bureau after being fired over displaying a pride flag","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A veteran FBI employee, David Maltinsky, was fired in November 2025 after displaying a Pride flag at his workstation, despite prior approval from supervisors and a history of supporting diversity initiatives.

about Lindsey Halligan’s big grand jury revelation at James Comey’s vindictive-prosecution hearing \n       \n  By Hannah Rabinowitz, Holmes Lybrand, Katelyn  Polantz, Casey Gannon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:10 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The hearing Wednesday morning in the case against former FBI Director James Comey ended with a revelation by prosecutors and a conundrum: if a full grand jury never reviewed the final set of charges handed up against Comey, are they void?\n \n\n   \n  The question arose after a shocking back and forth where prosecutors conceded that instead of presenting a new indictment to the grand jury after it declined to approve one of three counts, interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan simply brought an altered version, omitting the rejected count, to the magistrate’s courtroom for the grand jury’s foreperson to sign.\n \n\n   \n  Her admission sent shockwaves through the courtroom on Wednesday, where attorneys were gathered to argue a separate legal issue of whether Comey was charged only because of President Donald Trump’s animus toward him.\n \n\n   \n  What will happen to the criminal case was not immediately clear. Judge Michael Nachmanoff, despite appearing exasperated and taking several seconds of silence to take in what the prosecutors admitted, did not give away whether he viewed the issue as a procedural or fatal error.\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff did not make any rulings from the bench, saying that the issues before him were too  “weighty”  to immediately decide.\n \n\n   \n  But the judge ask the Justice Department to address Wednesday their legal interpretation of what happened with the grand jury, and the revelation is likely to play into another ongoing fight in the case where defense attorneys have asserted that federal investigators and top prosecutor Halligan mishandled the case.\n \n\n   \n  In a brief filed Wednesday evening, the Justice Department defended Halligan’s grand jury presentation and said the case should not be dismissed. The final indictment was reviewed by the grand jury foreperson and another representative — and then explained on the record in open court that it was reflective of the grand jury vote, the Justice Department wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The former FBI director has pleaded not guilty to lying during congressional testimony.\n \n\n   \n    The stunning admission\n \n\n   \n   Nachmanoff called on Halligan  — Trump’s handpicked US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who secured the indictment against Comey by herself — to explain exactly what grand jurors did, or did not, see.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan appeared frustrated as she confirmed that only the foreperson and one other juror – not the entire grand jury – saw the final indictment. In the brief exchange, she tried to answer the judge before he finished asking his question and concluded the exchange with a terse “OK.”\n \n\n   \n  The back and forth lasted about one minute.\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff also trained his attention on a different prosecutor on the case, Tyler Lemons, and asked him to explicitly confirm that the final document was never presented to the grand jury.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t there, but that is my understanding,” Lemons said.\n \n\n   \n  After the hearing concluded, people connected with the prosecutors’ office told CNN that they weren’t sure  how problematic Halligan’s admission will be  for the case. Some may consider it a clerical error that could be fixed, while others see a possibility it could be the fatal flaw in the case, as Comey’s team initially argued on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have six months to “cure” an indictment that was dismissed over legal issues, according to the  Justice Department manual , even if the statute of limitations has expired – as is the case for Comey’s charges.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorney Michael Dreeben said that, given the testimony of the prosecutor, “no indictment was returned.”\n \n\n   \n  And even if it is a legal problem, a grand jury document flub may pale in comparison to other issues that have arisen in the case and are still playing out in court, including regarding what Halligan told the grand jurors about Comey’s rights, the evidence and the law.\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury transcripts\n \n\n   \n  The issue over the indictment could also aid in defense attorneys’ efforts to gain access to the grand jury transcripts, an issue that is currently before a magistrate judge in the same courthouse.\n \n\n   \n  That judge initially allowed Comey’s team to have access to the grand jury material, finding in his own review that “the record points to a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors quickly asked the magistrate judge to pause the order so that they could file an appeal, which the magistrate judge allowed.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Ms. Halligan was not a puppet’\n \n\n   \n  The hearing focused primarily on defense attorneys’ efforts to have the case dismissed because, they argue, it was brought at the direction of Trump and born from his animosity toward Comey.\n \n\n   \n  “The president of the United States has caused the executive branch to prosecute a perceived enemy,” Dreeben began his arguments.\n \n\n   \n  Dreeben, citing a  social media post  from Trump addressed to the attorney general and calling for the prosecution of Comey and other political enemies, argued that the president has gone after the former director to “punish Mr. Comey for speaking out against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Lemons pushed back, arguing that Comey was making “inferential leaps” in arguing that the case is selective and vindictive.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor said that there is “no proof” that Halligan took Trump’s social media post “as a charge.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Halligan was not a puppet,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the judge questioned “what independent examination could she have made” in the few days between her appointment and the charges being brought against Comey.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ refuses to say if a memo declining to prosecute Comey exists\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff also pressed Lemons on whether previous prosecutors who worked on the case before Halligan’s appointment had submitted a memo recommending that Comey not be prosecuted.\n \n\n   \n  Lemons told the judge that someone in Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s office told him he couldn’t disclose  “privileged” information  without their permission, which included the existence of any memo.\n \n\n   \n  “At this point, my position would be, whether there was a declination memo, is privileged,” Lemons said, adding that “I don’t know in the world of documents there is a declination memo.”\n \n\n   \n  Nachmanoff challenged the assertion, pushing Lemons to eventually say that “someone in the Deputy Attorney General’s office” had instructed him not to say anything.\n \n\n   \n  Asked why, Lemons demurred, conceding briefly that he has “reviewed” draft memorandums – both declination and prosecution memos – and other internal communications, but declined to give additional details.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope you understand that I am trying to answer your questions,” Lemons said.\n \n\n   \n    Justice Department defends Halligan’s work\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in their Wednesday brief defended Lindsey Halligan’s handling of the grand jury proceedings against Comey.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of Wednesday’s hearing, Nachmanoff instructed the parties to review a case in Washington, DC, from the late 1960s that dealt with similar grand jury issues.\n \n\n   \n  But in that case, prosecutors argued in their brief, “the grand jury never saw any version of the eventual indictment.”\n \n\n   \n  “In this case, the grand jury was provided the proposed Indictment, deliberated, and determined that probable cause existed to believe that the defendant had committed the crimes charged in two counts,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  The grand jury did not hand up an indictment on a third charge prosecutors attempted to bring against Comey.\n \n\n   \n  After their vote, according to prosecutors, only the foreperson and one other grand juror remained when a final version of the indictment – that omitted the third charge that was rejected – was signed by the foreperson.\n \n\n   \n  “Only the numbering of the counts (i.e., proposed Count Two became Count One, and proposed Count Three became Count Two) and the paragraphs differ,” prosecutors said in their brief.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors argue the case doesn’t need to be dismissed “given that the grand jury was presented with the two counts on which it voted to return an indictment and in fact voted upon those counts.”\n \n\n   \n  “Grand Jury foreperson, as the representative of the Grand Jury, endorsed the revised two count Indictment by signing it and explaining on the record in open Court that the Indictment reflected the vote of the Grand Jury,” prosecutors continued.\n \n\n   \n  A magistrate judge earlier this week made the rare decision to order prosecutors to give Comey’s team all grand jury materials, including transcripts and recordings of the secret process.\n \n\n   \n  That judge, William Fitzpatrick, said his review of those transcripts and recordings suggested that the grand jury could have been shown privileged evidence or given false instructions by the attorney who presented the case, Lindsey Halligan.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors strongly pushed back against that, too, arguing Fitzpatrick had quoted portions of Halligan’s presentation and not her statements in full.\n \n\n   \n  “The magistrate judge’s recommendation is grounded in misreadings of the transcript, incorrect legal conclusions, and factual assumptions that the record directly disproves,” prosecutors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The U.S. Attorney did not misstate the law, the grand jury was not misled, and the transcript shows a routine, regular presentation of the indictment,” they said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli strikes across  Gaza  killed at least 28 Palestinians on Wednesday in the latest escalation of violence since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces said it carried out the strikes on Hamas targets after “several terrorists” fired on Israeli soldiers operating in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement,” the IDF said, adding that none of its forces had been injured.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas condemned the strikes as “a dangerous escalation” and rejected the IDF’s account, accusing Israel of trying to “justify its ongoing crimes and violations.” It called on the US to exert “immediate, serious pressure” on Israel to “respect the ceasefire and halt the aggression against our people.”\n \n\n   \n  The strikes come just days after the UN Security Council  endorsed  US President Donald Trump’s plan for how to move beyond the fragile truce to a more sustainable peace and the reconstruction of the devastated enclave.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in a separate development, Israel also carried out airstrikes on what it claimed were Hezbollah weapons storage sites in southern Lebanon.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza were the third major escalation since the  ceasefire agreement  came into force in October, each preceded by an attack on Israeli soldiers.\n \n\n   \n  In the two previous escalations, on  October 19  and  28 , approximately 150 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were killed.\n \n\n   \n  However, despite those escalations the ceasefire has largely held.\n \n\n   \n  Nine children were among those killed in Wednesday’s strikes, according to health officials in the enclave, and at least 77 others were injured.\n \n\n   \n  CNN footage taken at Gaza City’s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital complex shows dozens of people crowding around incoming ambulances carrying victims of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The footage shows several people sitting beside the corpses inside the hospital, some peering into the body bags in despair. One of the body bags contains the bodies of three lifeless children still covered in dust.\n \n\n   \n  The deadliest strike Wednesday was in the Zaytun area in the east of Gaza, where 10 people, including a woman and a child, were killed, Gaza Civil Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  Another strike hit an area west of Khan Younis targeting “a group of civilians inside the UNRWA club,” the Civil Defense added.\n \n\n   \n  UNRWA is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\n \n\n   \n  Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage during an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Since then, according to the Gaza health ministry, more than 69,000 Palestinians – most of them women and children – have been killed.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire framework, Hamas agreed to release all the remaining hostages in Gaza, living and dead, while Israel agreed to withdraw from some parts of Gaza and release some Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has since released all of the living hostages and the bodies of all but three of the dead ones.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes in Gaza come a day after an Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in  Lebanon killed 13 people,  according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The IDF said Tuesday’s strike had targeted “a Hamas training compound” that was being used to “plan and carry out terrorist attacks against the IDF and the State of Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Israel carried out further strikes in southern Lebanon, targeting what it said were “several weapons storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah’s rocket unit.” The strikes caused no casualties but damaged several houses, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has been carrying out strikes in  Lebanon targeting militants from Hezbollah  as well as various Palestinian militant factions for more than two years. These escalated after Iran-backed Hezbollah launched attacks on Israel in support of Hamas following the October 7 attack.

may be next as immigration enforcement expands in North Carolina. Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Priscilla Alvarez, Rebekah Riess, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:44 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rheba Hamilton was sipping coffee   on her porch Saturday morning as she watched the two workers she‘d hired begin    draping her front yard tree with lights in a quiet Charlotte, North Carolina, neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Suddenly, a gray minivan – doors already ajar –  made a sharp stop at the corner . Two federal   agents emerged and asked the landscapers for their papers. Hamilton joined the men on the lawn and started recording. Shortly after, the agents retreated.\n \n\n   \n  The abruptness of the incident took Hamilton by surprise,  mirroring the shock local officials and residents  felt as Charlotte became the latest city caught up this year in a string of targeted immigration actions.\n \n\n   \n  What began in Charlotte quickly spread to other cities in the state as the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown continues to expand nationally.  Gregory Bovino , the top Border Patrol official charged with enforcement operations, is expected to head to New Orleans in coming weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Here is where things stand:\n \n\n   \n    Next city to be targeted may already be in enforcement crackdown’s sights\n \n\n   \n  While the spotlight has been focused on North Carolina’s most populated city, immigration enforcement action has started to spread to other areas of the state and is expected to reach New Orleans within weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino – who for many has become the face of the crackdown – is expected to arrive in New Orleans, where he once served as chief patrol agent, the first week of December, according to two sources familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security is expected to deploy 250 agents in Louisiana – roughly in line with the number of agents  sent to other cities to assist Bovino, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year his administration was “making a determination.”\n \n\n   \n  As immigration enforcement is expected to spread further throughout the South, Customs and Border Protection agents  were seen Tuesday in North Carolina’s Wake and Durham counties , Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said during a City Council meeting. The counties are home to Raleigh and Durham, two of the state’s other major cities and part of the Research Triangle, with Chapel Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “We are just encouraging everyone, if you feel unsafe or you see something that you think is illegal, to please call the Raleigh Police Department or your local jurisdiction and to stay safe,” Cowell said.\n \n\n   \n  Residents of Cary, North Carolina, west of Raleigh, have  also reported seeing federal agents  at hospitals, restaurants and construction sites, Mayor Harold Weinbrecht told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters  gathered at Moore Square in downtown Raleigh  on Tuesday night, holding American flags and signs printed with slogans like, “No fear no hate, no ICE in our state” and “Respect due process,” aerial footage from CNN affiliate WRAL shows.\n \n\n   \n    DHS arrests more than 250 people in Charlotte\n \n\n   \n  Over 250 people have been arrested in immigration raids in Charlotte since the weekend, DHS said in an update Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Among those arrested are “numerous criminal illegal aliens with extensive immigration and criminal histories, including domestic violence, assault, breaking and entering, larceny, and driving while intoxicated,” a Wednesday DHS statement said.   \n \n\n   \n  DHS Secretary Kristi Noem  said Tuesday  the Charlotte operation was based on previous investigative work, specifically citing “a high number of child abuse, trafficking, neglect type of instances that we had identified over our work there.”\n \n\n   \n  Two men were  federally charged in Charlotte  Tuesday for allegedly using their vehicles in separate incidents to assault federal officers who were conducting immigration enforcement, according to Russ Ferguson, the US Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. The charges don’t stem from protests in the area, the US attorney said.\n \n\n   \n  A woman was also charged Wednesday after she allegedly assaulted a federal agent outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Charlotte, the US attorney’s office  said in a news release . The 44-year-old woman is accused of “grabbing the officer’s shoulders and attempting to jump on the officer’s back” while the officer was trying to arrest another person Sunday, the release said.\n \n\n   \n    Attorneys are turning to creative measures to find their clients\n \n\n   \n  The uptick in immigration detentions in Charlotte and the absence of information from the federal government has prompted some immigration attorneys to get creative in how they track clients being held in ICE custody.\n \n\n   \n  One of those attorneys is Gigi Gardner, a North Carolina immigration attorney, who said her client was detained on Tuesday after attending a routine ICE check-in.\n \n\n   \n     Her client – who she didn’t name, citing safety and client confidentiality concerns – has been in the US for roughly 40 years and has checked in with ICE annually, Gardner said.\n \n\n   \n     After failed attempts to get into the ICE office late last week due to a high volume of people, Gardner’s client checked in Tuesday, when he was detained, she said. Gardner and her client’s wife tracked his whereabouts by using the location of his AirPods, she said.\n \n\n   \n  They tracked his movements to  Folkston, Georgia, where there’s an ICE detention center . The AirPod’s battery appeared to die and it wasn’t until Wednesday morning that the man called his wife to say he had been transferred again – this time, to Jacksonville, Florida, Gardner said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing has changed. He has an attorney. And he was unable to contact me. They haven’t sent me any paperwork. They haven’t told me where he is. And they still haven’t told me where he is,” she said, referring to ICE.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte community takes some tips from Chicago\n \n\n   \n  While the targeted immigration raids were unexpected to many of those in the Charlotte community, they were ready to meet the moment.\n \n\n   \n  People throughout Charlotte  were seen Monday  using many of the tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights.\n \n\n   \n  The support from residents across the city is palpable. Flags from Honduras, Colombia and Mexico are seen adorning cars and hanging from homes and buisinesses, a stark difference from what could be seen as recently as a week ago.\n \n\n   \n  Their vigilance comes as many businesses across the city have closed their doors, fearing their customers will be a target. About  half the mom-and-pop businesses  the community development organization  CharlotteEast  works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.\n \n\n   \n  A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear   chased and tackled people outside the shop. A program for immigrant and refugee children  was also suspended until further notice  Monday after Border Patrol was active at their site.\n \n\n   \n  A local laundromat is taking a different approach, with  the owner locking their doors  while customers are inside in an attempt to keep them safe.\n \n\n   \n  In Raleigh, more than 600 volunteers signed up in the overnight hours to help others travel within the city when the community became aware that federal agents intended to come to the area Tuesday, Siembra NC, a statewide immigrant worker organizing group, said.\n \n\n   \n  “By early morning, trained volunteers were dispatched throughout Raleigh as safety patrols ready to assist neighbors in getting to school and work safely,” a release from the organization said.\n \n\n   \n    About 20% of students absent from Charlotte-area schools Monday\n \n\n   \n  More than  30,000 students were absent  from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment. CNN has reached out to the district to see how attendance was affected Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The district  issued a statement Sunday night  saying no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and noting leaders hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS follows all federal and state laws protecting students’ right to a public education. The U.S. Supreme Court guarantees that all children, regardless of immigration status, have the right to attend public school,” CMS Assistant Communications Officer Tom Miner said in a statement to school district families.\n \n\n   \n  High school students in the district  staged a walkout Tuesday morning  to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, an aerial Getty photo of the demonstration showed.\n \n\n   \n    North Carolina governor and local leaders denounce the raids\n \n\n   \n  Many Democratic leaders across North Carolina have denounced the raids.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve reached out to the White House,”  North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said Tuesday.  “We haven’t gotten any word. We’re not hearing directly from Customs and Border Patrol, so we don’t know for sure where they’re going, how long they’ll be here, where else they’re going.”\n \n\n   \n  Stein went on to criticize the tactics used by federal agents, saying they are “not promoting safety in our communities.”\n \n\n   \n  In the county where Charlotte is located,   the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday to affirm constitutional protections and express support for the immigrant community.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not an issue of policy. This is an issue of morality,” Chair Mark Jerrell said. “It’s immoral to profile, to tear families apart. It’s not right to have people living in fear … This board declared tonight that we don’t condone it. We won’t stand for it.”\n \n\n   \n  While the governor and local leaders vocally oppose the federal action, North Carolina’s Republican Party  praised the immigration enforcement  operation, saying “the need is real.”\n \n\n   \n  Though some people are overwhelmed with the intensity of the moment, Councilmember LaWana Mayfield  said during a City Council committee meeting Monday  that this moment is “an opportunity to show up for each other.”\n \n\n   \n  “Get to know your neighbors, get their phone numbers, go to their back door, bring them over to your house so the children can feel safe, let the kids play together, because they don’t need to be going through all of this,” Mayfield said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/europe/poland-fighter-jets-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"18:03:00-05:00","title":"Major Russian attack on western Ukraine hits apartment buildings, killing 26","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major Russian airstrike targeted two apartment buildings in Ternopil, Ukraine, killing at least 26 people and injuring nearly 100, including children, prompting NATO to scramble fighter jets from Poland and Romania after a Russian drone crossed into Romanian airspace.

buildings, killing 26 \n       \n  By Victoria Butenko, Kosta Gak, Todd Symons and Catherine Nicholls, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:03 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Russian airstrikes hit two apartment buildings in Ukraine overnight, killing more than two dozen people including three children, in a rare large-scale assault on the west of the country that prompted NATO to scramble fighter jets over neighboring Poland and Romania.\n \n\n   \n  The massive assault on the western city of Ternopil killed at least 26 people and injured nearly 100 others, Ukraine’s interior minister said Wednesday. Earlier, Ukraine’s State Emergecy Service reported that 18 of the injured were children.\n \n\n   \n  Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko suggested Wednesday evening that entire families are missing. He said officials do not have contact with 25 people and that “in some cases there is no one to file a report.”\n \n\n   \n  Oksana Kobel remained hopeful that her son, who was in a ninth-floor apartment at the time of the attack, would be found alive.\n \n\n   \n  “I went to work, heard the explosions. I called him and said, ‘Bohdan, go to the shelter, get dressed.’ He answered, ‘Mom, I am already up. Everything will be fine,’” she said, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said emergency services still were working in the city “to help the victims and save as many lives as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  He warned that the death toll could rise, as “there are still people trapped under the rubble.” Zelensky said that Russia “will never stop on its own,” and he urged allies to increase pressure on Moscow to halt the violence and restore peace.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s attacks have mostly targeted the eastern part of the country and large cities such as Kyiv. Many Ukrainians have fled to the west, seeing it as safer.\n \n\n   \n  Romania’s Defense Ministry said it scrambled two Eurofighters, part of NATO’s fleet, and later two Romanian F-16 fighter jets after a  Russian drone entered its airspace  during the attack.\n \n\n   \n  Polish and allied fighter jets were also launched to protect Polish airspace on Wednesday morning, the country’s  operational command  said.\n \n\n   \n  Poland’s Rzeszow and Lublin airports, in the country’s east, were also closed “due to the need to ensure freedom of operation for military aviation,” the Polish air navigation service PANSA said on X.  ﻿ They were later reopened.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian air force said Russia fired hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles during the attack overnight. It said the residential buildings in Ternopil were most likely hit by Russia’s powerful Kh-101 cruise missile, which is designed to avoid air defenses and is equipped with an advanced precision guiding system.   \n \n\n   \n  The latest aerial attack came hours after Zelensky arrived in Turkey in an effort to “reinvigorate” peace talks and prisoner of war exchanges with Russia. Moscow is not involved in those talks, but Turkey has been a key interlocutor between the two.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky said Ukraine was “working to resume exchanges before the New Year and return Ukrainian military prisoners, Ukrainian civilians held by Russia, and abducted Ukrainian children home.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the US administration has been quietly hammering out a new peace plan with Russia to end its war with Ukraine, a person familiar with the issue told CNN. The US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who has been at the center of the  administration’s talks with Moscow , has been leading the effort, the source said. The negotiations have accelerated this week as the Kremlin has signaled a renewed openness to a deal.\n \n\n   \n  Many regions of Ukraine were left without power Wednesday after strikes on the country’s energy infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of people were also wounded in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, where drone strikes damaged apartment buildings and left several cars burning on the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Russia said it shot down four US-made ATACMS missiles “deep within” its territory on Tuesday. The missiles, which Ukraine said it fired, were shot down over the city of Voronezh, around 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the Ukrainian border, the Russian Defense Ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  The use of the missiles, which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles), was first approved under the Biden presidency. Russia has denounced their use as  a major escalation .\n \n\n   \n  The latest move by NATO comes during a tense week. Polish officials have pointed the finger at Russia after a  key train track was destroyed  in what Warsaw said was an “unprecedented act of sabotage” committed by two Ukrainian citizens who were “collaborating with Russian services.” Russian officials have denied the accusation.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski said he would close the last Russian consulate in the country in response to the destruction of the train track. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed regret over the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the US State Department approved a possible $105 million sale that would allow Ukraine to upgrade its Patriot air defense system – a critical shield against Russian aerial attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “The proposed sale will improve Ukraine’s ability to meet current and future threats by further equipping it to conduct self-defense and regional security missions with a more robust local sustainment capability,” said a Pentagon statement.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Zelensky struck a deal during a visit to Paris to purchase “up to 100” French-made Rafale fighter jets as well as anti-air defenses and drones from France.\n \n\n   \n  NATO allies have  increasingly scrambled fighter jets  in recent months during Russian attacks on Ukraine, or when stray Russian munitions, drones and warplanes have either strayed too close to their borders or crossed them.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/americas/brazilian-amazon-gangs-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:51:00-05:00","title":"Gangs expand to nearly half the towns in the Brazilian Amazon, report finds","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Organized criminal gangs have expanded their operations across nearly half of the municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon, with 344 out of 772 towns now affected—an increase of 32% from the previous year.

nearly half of the region’s municipalities, according to a report published Wednesday by a prominent nonprofit organization.\n \n\n   \n  The growth of these crime groups in the region, where  UN climate talks  are currently taking place, is driving violence and threatens the preservation of the world’s largest tropical rainforest, according to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety.\n \n\n   \n  Organized crime groups are now active in 344 municipalities out of 772, or some 45%, the nonprofit said. That’s a jump of 32% from last year’s report when they were present in 260, and more than double from two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The Red Command drug trafficking gang has more than doubled its presence since 2023. The notorious crime group was the target of Rio’s  most lethal  police operation ever on October 28, when 121 people died.\n \n\n   \n  The raid in Rio sparked a nationwide discussion on organized crime in Brazil, and on Tuesday evening the country’s lower house approved a bill that proposes an increase in the severity of sentences for gang membership.\n \n\n   \n  “These crime groups are seeking to diversify and maximize their illegal activities,” David Marques, one of the report’s authors, told The Associated Press. “In addition to drug-trafficking, there’s been an increase of extortion and environmental crimes,” such as illegal logging and mining, he said.\n \n\n   \n  With more criminal gangs come territorial disputes, weapons and violence, Marques said. There were 8,047 slayings in the region in 2024, a rate of 27.3 killings per 100,000 inhabitants, 31% higher than the national average, the group said.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Red Command and its main rival, First Capital Command, there are some 17 other criminal gangs operation in the region, also including Venezuela’s  Tren de Aragua , a target of  military attack s by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  The Rio-based Red Command has dominated river routes in coordination with Peruvian and Colombian cartels. Drugs flow to strategic ports such as Manaus, Santarem, Barcarena, Macapa and Belem – where Brazil is hosting COP30.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Sao Paulo-based First Capital Command has focused on using clandestine airstrips in remote areas that are tied to illegal mining, the group said.\n \n\n   \n  The group’s director, Renato Sérgio de Lima, said in a statement that combating organized crime in the Amazon will require a focus on alternate ways of developing the region besides “predatory exploitation of resources.”\n \n\n   \n  The bill approved by the lower house on Tuesday would boost sentences for certain crimes when the defendant also is a member of a gang, for example increasing the 6-to-20-year recommended sentence for intentional homicide to 20-to-40 years. It also would allow authorities to seize assets even before a case’s final judgement and oblige gang leaders to carry out their time behind bars in maximum-security federal prisons.\n \n\n   \n  President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has lamented on X that the legislation has been weakened because of proposed budget cuts to the federal police. The bill is now headed for the Senate, where it is likely to be modified, though some compromise version is likely to pass the congress eventually because crime has become a top concern of voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/dissent-texas-redistricting-case-judge-jerry-smith-all-about-eve","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:13:00-05:00","title":"‘I dissent,’ judge says 16 times in 100-page broadside against colleagues in Texas redistricting case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major redistricting case involving Texas, federal judge Jerry Smith issued a 100-page dissent against the majority decision — authored by judges Jeffrey Brown and David Guaderrama — which blocked Texas’s newly drawn congressional map on grounds of racial gerrymandering.

He said the “’obvious reason’” behind the decision to redraw the state’s congressional maps “’of course, is partisan gain,’” and that Brown was wrong to conclude that state lawmakers are “more bigoted than political.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s all politics, on both sides of the partisan aisle. George and Alex Soros have their hands all over this,” Smith wrote, referring to the billionaire father and son who have supported liberal causes.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also repeatedly invoked California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who successfully pushed lawmakers and voters in the Golden State to redraw its maps to counteract the Texas effort.\n \n\n   \n  “Gavin Newsom took a victory lap in Houston to celebrate the Democrat redistricting win with Proposition 50,” he wrote. “That tells you all that you need to know – this is about partisan politics, plain and simple.”\n \n\n   \n  Smith also argues that Brown wrongly described the standard the court needed to use when deciding whether to block the map quickly, writing, in part, that his colleague understated how strong the challengers’ arguments against the redrawn districts needed to be.\n \n\n   \n  “With his creative formulation of the preliminary-injunction standard, Judge Brown is intentionally misleading at best and disingenuously false,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Sprinkled throughout the stinging opinion issued by Smith are more insults but also lighter, zippier lines, including references to the 1950 movie “All About Eve.”\n \n\n   \n  “’Fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a bumpy night!’” Smith’s dissent began.\n \n\n   \n  He closed with: “Darkness descends on the Rule of Law. A bumpy night, indeed.”\n \n\n   \n  Texas has appealed the ruling. But should it stand, it will be a major setback for Trump and Republicans, who had made Texas the  centerpiece of a national campaign  to redraw maps ahead of the midterms.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The outrage speaks for itself’\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n  In his four-page statement accompanying the 100-page dissent, Smith describes in detail the timeline that precipitated the release of the majority decision, penned by Brown and joined by District Judge David Guaderrama, an appointee of former President Barack Obama.\n \n\n   \n  Smith says that Brown told him last week that the majority intended to issue their ruling in coming days because they believed they could not wait any longer due to an election law principle that says courts should avoid making last-minute changes to how elections are run before the contests get underway.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Smith said, Brown wrote him a note in the morning that said: “I’m sorry that we can’t wait on your dissent. Purcell compels us to get the ruling out as soon as we possibly can. It turns out that’s today.” The majority opinion was issued shortly thereafter.\n \n\n   \n  “This outrage speaks for itself,” Smith wrote in his statement. “Any pretense of judicial restraint, good faith, or trust by these two judges is gone. If these judges were so sure of their result, they would not have been so unfairly eager to issue the opinion sans my dissent, or they could have waited for the dissent in order to join issue with it. What indeed are they afraid of?”\n \n\n   \n  The majority’s decision to release the ruling Tuesday without the dissenting opinion attached, Smith said, diminished “the impact of the dissent and the public’s access to it.”\n \n\n   \n  “In the interest of justice, one can hope it is only a Pyrrhic victory,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Judges in the majority don’t get to tell a dissenting judge or judges that they can’t participate,” Smith wrote. “If the two judges on this panel get away with what they have done, it sets a horrendous precedent that ‘might makes right’ and the end justifies the means.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge’s statement skewering Brown ended on an ominous note.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was … newer on the bench, a friend asked me, ‘Now that you’ve been a judge for a few years, do you have any particular advice?’” Smith wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “I replied, ‘Always sit with your back to the wall.’”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ethan Cohen contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/bessent-trump-federal-reserve-powell","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:58:00-05:00","title":"Trump Teases He’ll Fire Bessent if Fed Doesn’t Cut Interest Rates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has threatened to fire Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent if the Federal Reserve does not cut interest rates, underscoring intense political pressure on monetary policy.

Bessent if Fed doesn’t cut interest rates \n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:58 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested he would fire Treasury Secretary  Scott Bessent  if the Federal Reserve doesn’t decrease interest rates.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing Scott is blowing it on is the Fed because the Fed, the rates are too high, Scott. If you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass,” the president said, smirking, during a speech at a US-Saudi investment forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  However, it won’t be easy for Trump to bend the Fed to his will: The Fed makes its decisions on interest rates independently, based solely on economic data, meaning that firing Bessent would simply not lead to lower rates. Several Fed officials have also said in recent public comments that they remain concerned about inflation, leaning against further rate cuts.\n \n\n   \n  The president has been a frequent critic of the central bank and its chair,  Jerome Powell , throughout his second term as the Federal Reserve declined to cut interest rates this year until September. But he acknowledged on Wednesday that Bessent has been privately urging him not to fire Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly said he wants out of the job.\n \n\n   \n  Trump appeared to suggest that Bessent has been the “voice of reason,” while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick “is a little bit more for firing” Powell.\n \n\n   \n  “Please don’t fire him. He’s got three months to go,’” the president said, appearing to repeat what Bessent has told him of Powell.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to get him out,” Trump said, reenacting their conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Howard is a little bit more for firing him. I think Howard would say get him the hell out of there,” the president said\n \n\n   \n    Bessent as a “voice of reason”\n \n\n   \n  Trump frequently threatened to fire Powell during the spring, but the president eventually backed off from those threats after his closest advisers warned of the chaos in financial markets that could ensue if he were to do so,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday is the first time Trump has appeared to suggest that Bessent, who has become well-respected on Wall Street, was one of the voices urging him to keep Powell in his role until the end of his term.\n \n\n   \n  “Markets have really appreciated having Bessent around,” James Ragan, director of wealth management research at DA Davidson, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s been very much the voice of reason in the Trump administration, so I don’t like to hear him challenging Bessent,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    The Fed’s decision making and Trump’s demands\n \n\n   \n  Fed officials say their decisions on rates are guided solely by what economic figures show, and they strive to achieve their dual mandate of full employment and stable prices. That’s precisely why Trump’s frequent demands for lower rates have largely fallen on deaf ears — and may continue to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s rate-setting committee, led by Powell as chair, began to lower interest rates in September for the first time in nine months, and delivered another quarter-point rate cut at its latest meeting last month. October’s rate cuts bring the benchmark lending rate to  its lowest in three years. \n \n\n   \n  The Fed has been lowering rates to prevent unemployment from surging, though officials are divided over whether they should continue to lower rates with  inflation still above their 2% target  and Trump’s tariffs still threatening to push inflation higher.\n \n\n   \n  Minutes from the Fed’s October meeting underscored the heated debate among the policymakers of the world’s most powerful central bank, with several stating that they prefer to stand pat in December: “Many participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year,” the minutes said.\n \n\n   \n  Investors currently see a roughly 68% chance of the Fed holding rates steady next month, according to futures, compared to a 32% chance of another cut.\n \n\n   \n  New data on the labor market’s health in September, which was delayed due to the government shutdown, is due on Thursday. Signs that the labor market is falling off a cliff would prompt the Fed to continue to lowering borrowing costs heading into next year, though officials are keeping a close eye on inflation.\n \n\n   \n  How the Fed makes its decisions is no secret, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly demanding aggressive rate cuts and lambasting Powell, whose term ends in May.\n \n\n   \n  Trump could name Powell’s successor as early as December, and there are  five people on his short list , according to Bessent, who has led the search. But even if Trump names a loyalist who would call for aggressive rate cuts, that still wouldn’t do the trick because the Fed chair only gets one vote and they cannot unilaterally veto what the majority of the Fed’s 12-person rate-setting committee decides.\n \n\n   \n  The new Fed chair, whoever it may be, would have to persuade their colleagues to go along with any plans to lower rates aggressively, and at the moment, only one Fed official said he believes that is the right approach: Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who is taking an unpaid leave from his job as a top White House economist to temporarily serve on the Fed’s board.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/nvidia-earnings-ai-bubble-fears","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"Nvidia Beats Earnings Expectations, Even as Bubble Concerns Mount","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nvidia reported strong financial results in the October quarter, posting a 62% year-over-year revenue growth to $57 billion and a 65% increase in profits to $31.9 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations.

     \nUpdated: \n        5:25 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nvidia posted strong revenue and profits that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations Wednesday. The closely watched result could prompt a sigh of relief across the stock market following growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s sales grew 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the October quarter, ahead of the $54.9 billion Wall Street had projected, signaling that demand for AI chips remains strong even as more questions emerge about whether returns from the technology will keep up with the pace of infrastructure investments. It posted profits of $31.9 billion, up 65% from the year-ago quarter and also slightly above expectations.\n \n\n   \n  “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, a message that echoes his earlier arguments that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.\n \n\n   \n  The company also posted stronger-than-expected sales guidance of around $65 billion for the fourth quarter, another indicator that the AI spending spree isn’t slowing anytime soon.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s stock ( NVDA ) jumped 3.4% in after-hours trading immediately following the report.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia has become both the backbone and an emblem of the AI boom, with much of the industry’s technology running on its chips. The  world’s most valuable public company  has also been central to this year’s stock market rally — it accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500 and its deals with other tech firms have helped fuel their stocks, too — meaning that nearly all investors and 401k holders  stand to be impacted  by Wednesday’s results.\n \n\n   \n  Fears of an AI bubble ahead of Nvidia’s report had caused volatility across the stock market as investors adopted a risk-off attitude and dumped assets like bitcoin and AI stocks.\n \n\n   \n  Shares of other tech stocks — including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google — were in the green in after-hours trading following the Nvidia report, underscoring the chipmaker’s impact on the wider market.\n \n\n   \n  “This answers a lot of questions about the state of the AI revolution, and the verdict is simple: it is nowhere near its peak, neither from the market-demand nor the production–supply-chain sides for the foreseeable future,” Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in emailed commentary following the report.\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of the bubble concerns are the circular funding deals that Nvidia and other chipmakers have formed with AI companies, such as a  $100 billion investment  in OpenAI in exchange for chip purchases that was announced in September. OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar further raised eyebrows earlier this month when  she suggested  that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure — a statement the company later tried to walk back.\n \n\n   \n  But the fears haven’t stopped Nvidia from making more such deals. Anthropic on Monday  committed  to buying $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft Azure, running on Nvidia chips, in exchange for an investment in the AI lab from both tech giants.\n \n\n   \n  Huang has repeatedly batted down bubble concerns. At the company’s GTC AI conference last month, he told CNN that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  The fact that Nvidia’s business continues to hum isn’t surprising given that tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google  all indicated  in their most recent earnings reports that they plan to continue hiking their AI infrastructure spending. Huang also  laid out  at GTC the company’s plans to get its technology into even more areas of life — from cell phone towers to self- driving cars.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress sought to reinforce that AI is generating returns in the company’s earnings call by taking the unusual tack of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads;” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year; and Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/anna-kepner-carnival-cruise-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:51:00Z","title":"Speculation Intensifies in the Death of a Florida High Schooler on a Cruise","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The mysterious death of 18-year-old Anna Kepner, a high school cheerleader from Titusville, Florida, during a cruise on the Carnival Horizon has drawn international attention and intense speculation.

world’s richest man and the CEO of the most valuable company met with Saudi officials \n       \n  By Hadas Gold, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:23 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Saudi Arabia is strengthening its ties with American AI companies — announcing a flurry of new joint ventures worth billions of dollars. The country seeks to make its mark in the AI industry as its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, makes his first visit to the United States in years.\n \n\n   \n  Humain —  an AI company backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund  — announced a series of partnerships with prominent American tech companies, including xAI, Cisco, AMD and Qualcomm, during a US-Saudi investment forum in Washington on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia is trying to further firm up ties with the United States and shift its economy  away from oil . For American companies, the Middle Eastern country answers three urgent   problems for AI expansion: funding, space and cheap energy.\n \n\n   \n  Elon Musk announced at Wednesday’s event that xAI,  his AI company , will develop a huge data center in Saudi Arabia alongside Humain. The planned 500-megawatt data center would be xAI’s first large-scale center outside of the United States, and the partnership will see xAI’s  Grok chatbot  deployed throughout Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  “The future of intelligence will be engineered through massive and efficient compute combined with the most advanced AI models,” Musk said in a statement on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The center will be powered by chips from Nvidia, whose founder, Jensen Huang, sat alongside Musk and Saudi Arabian Minister of Communications and Information Technology Abdullah Alswaha at Wednesday’s panel. No further details about the partnership were revealed.\n \n\n   \n  “This is how we walk the talk in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in partnership with the US,” Alswaha said. “Yesterday, the president and his royal highness announced the AI strategic framework and partnership. Today we’re going big with Elon and Jensen, so thank you for those opportunities.”\n \n\n   \n  Bloomberg  reported  on Wednesday that the United States is set to approve the first sales of advanced AI chips to Humain.\n \n\n   \n  At the event, Alswaha announced a 100-megawatt data center for Amazon Web Services “with a gigawatt ambition” that also will be powered by Nvidia’s infrastructure. AWS said in a statement that it plans “to provide, deploy and manage up to 150,000 AI accelerators” in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  As AI companies expand, their huge data centers need  space  and  massive energy sources . Many data centers are being built in the United States, including  xAI’s Colossus in Memphis . However, there’s fear that China will beat out the United States when it comes to  energy production  to power AI systems. Saudi Arabia could help with that — it has much easier access to the space and energy needed to power these massive ventures.\n \n\n   \n  The investment from Saudi Arabia also plays a major part in Prince bin Salman’s redemption in the United States, following being labeled a “pariah” by  President Joe Biden  for his role in the killing of  Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi .\n \n\n   \n  During his Oval Office visit on Wednesday, Prince bin Salman claimed the country will be investing $1 trillion dollars in the United States, a substantial increase from the previously announced $600 billion investment in May. The comments surprised even President Donald Trump in the moment, although the timeline of the investments is not clear.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re saying to me now that the $600 billion will be $1 trillion?” Trump said to Prince bin Salman in the Oval Office. “Good. I like that very much.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2023/01/10/us/ana-walshe-brian-missing-timeline","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Societal and Cultural Shifts in 2023","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article explores the evolving landscape of society and culture in 2023, focusing on key trends such as inclusivity, sustainability, and the impact of technology.

Here’s a timeline of the case \n       \n  By Eric Levenson, Holly Yan and Lauren del Valle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:21 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ana Walshe, a 39-year-old mother of three, was first reported missing by her coworkers in Washington, DC on January 4, 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband, Brian Walshe, initially told investigators that he had last seen her on New Year’s Day when she left their Cohasset, Massachusetts, home for the airport.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors say his statements to police were misleading, and they argue he secretly killed his wife, dismembered her body and disposed of her remains. As evidence, they pointed to a  series of chilling Google searches  on his son’s iPad, including “How long before a body starts to smell” and “How to clean blood from wooden floor.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe, now 50, has  pleaded not guilty to murder , but in a surprise move just as jury selection was about to start on November 18, 2025, he  pleaded guilty  to misleading police and improper conveyance of a human body.\n \n\n   \n  His murder trial subsequently started later that day.\n \n\n   \n  To better understand the case, CNN assembled a timeline of the couple’s movements in recent years, including his history of legal trouble, strains on their marriage and his actions in the critical days around his wife’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n    September 2018\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe’s father, Dr. Thomas Walshe, died in September 2018 and left nothing to Brian, leading to a protracted legal fight over his estate, according to court documents filed in Plymouth Probate and Family Court in Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Walshe’s will noted he was not in contact with Brian, to whom he bequeathed only his “best wishes” and “nothing else” from his estate, according to photographs of the document attached to court documents. Brian Walshe unsuccessfully contested the will and suggested his father’s signature on the document was a possible forgery.\n \n\n   \n  Affidavits in opposition to Brian Walshe’s petition said he had been estranged from his father and detailed years of alleged swindling and manipulation.\n \n\n   \n  “He had a severe falling out with his son,” wrote Andrew Walshe, the estate’s executor and one of Dr. Walshe’s nephews. “Brian had ran off with a significant amount of his money; he had had almost zero contact with Brian R. Walshe over the last ten plus years.” \n \n\n   \n    2018\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was indicted on federal fraud charges in October 2018 for allegedly selling fake Andy Warhol artwork online, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  FBI investigators alleged Brian or Ana Walshe used her eBay account to sell the paintings in November 2016, less than a year after they were married. The complaint does not charge Ana Walshe with wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The document also alleged Brian Walshe took real artwork from a friend to sell, but never did. He also did not compensate the friend for the art, prosecutors alleged.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded not guilty to wire fraud, interstate transportation for a scheme to defraud, possession of converted goods and unlawful monetary transaction in November 2018.\n \n\n   \n    2021\n \n\n   \n  In April 2021, Brian Walshe  pleaded guilty  to three of the four federal counts in exchange for a recommended sentence of incarceration, supervised release, fines, restitution and forfeiture, court documents show. He also agreed to either return the artworks or pay for them.\n \n\n   \n  As part of pre-sentencing probation, Brian Walshe was placed on monitoring and house arrest. He can request to leave home but must detail the specific locations, times and reasons.\n \n\n   \n    November 2022\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe  was having an affair with a man  in DC and spent Thanksgiving with him in Dublin, Ireland, according to court documents. The man told investigators he had been in a relationship with Ana Walshe for several months, the documents state.\n \n\n   \n    December 2022\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe began to suspect his wife was having an affair, according to  Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Greg Connor .\n \n\n   \n  “He was routinely visiting the Instagram page of one of her male friends. And on December 26th, his mother – with his input and direction – obtained and hired a private investigator to surveil Ana Walshe in Washington, DC.”\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe’s defense attorney disputes the allegation that the husband suspected his wife was having an affair.\n \n\n   \n    December 27, 2022\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe Google searched, “What’s the best state to divorce for a man,” according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n    December 28, 2022\n \n\n   \n  During dinner with a friend in DC, Ana Walshe “became uncharacteristically upset and told her friend she believed that Mr. Walshe was going to be incarcerated as a result of his federal case, and that she was prepared to leave him and take the children to Washington, DC,” according to Connor.\n \n\n   \n    December 30, 2022\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe flew home to Massachusetts to be with her family during for the holiday weekend and was not expected to return to DC until January 3, prosecutor Connor said.\n \n\n   \n    December 31, 2022\n \n\n   \n  The Walshes hosted a New Year’s Eve dinner at their home with a friend named Gem, Brian Walshe told police, according to an affidavit.\n \n\n   \n  Brian and Ana Walshe went to bed shortly after the friend left around 1 or 1:30 a.m., he told investigators, according to the affidavit. He also told police that Ana Walshe said she had a work emergency and needed to fly to Washington for her job the next morning.\n \n\n   \n    January 1, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe told police that the morning of New Year’s Day, Ana Walshe “got ready and kissed him goodbye and told him to go back to sleep,”  the affidavit states. She usually took an Uber, Lyft or taxi to the airport and left between 6 and 7 a.m., according to the affidavit.\n \n\n   \n  According to prosecutors, Brian Walshe made a  series of Google searches  on his son’s iPad, including “How long before a body starts to smell,” “10 ways to dispose of a dead body if you really need to,” “How long for someone to be missing to inherit,” and “How to clean blood from wooden floor.”\n \n\n   \n  Walshe told police a babysitter arrived in the afternoon, and he left home to get groceries at about 3 p.m., the affidavit states. \n \n\n   \n  He told police he then went to see his mother around 4 p.m. in Swampscott, about an hour drive from Cohasset, but did not have his cell phone and got lost – making the trip longer than usual, the affidavit states. \n \n\n   \n  He said he left his mother’s home within about 15 minutes of arriving to run errands for her at Whole Foods and CVS. Brian Walshe told police he eventually returned home to Cohasset at about 8 p.m., according to the affidavit.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors say the evidence from January 1 tells a far different story than what Walshe claimed. \n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe had told the babysitter and a family friend that he had lost his phone, Connor said.\n \n\n   \n  But “subsequent analysis of his phone determined that it was actually plugged in the morning of January 1,” Connor said. \n \n\n   \n  “However, while his phone stayed at the house, the oldest child’s cell phone did not.”\n \n\n   \n  Cell phone data from January 1 showed the oldest child’s device had traveled to two stores. Surveillance video showed Brian Walshe walking into those same stores by himself, Connor said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 5:30 p.m., surveillance video showed Walshe and his vehicle going to a dumpster in the parking lot of a liquor store and disposing of items before returning to his car, the prosecutor said. \n \n\n   \n  Afterward, cell phone data shows the device traveled to the dumpster at an apartment complex where Brian Walshe’s mother lived. \n \n\n   \n  The phone then traveled to a Lowe’s store, where Walshe is also seen on surveillance footage. He purchased five 5-gallon buckets, a hacksaw, 48 terry cloth towels, a full-coverage suit, 200 disposable rags, trash bags and cleaning products, Connor said. \n \n\n   \n  The phone then traveled to a CVS store, where Walshe was also seen on surveillance video purchasing “13 different types of hydrogen peroxide,” the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n    January 2, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s cell phone pinged in the area of their Cohasset home on January 1 and 2, prosecutor Lynn Beland said.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe told investigators that he took one of his children for ice cream at a juice bar in Norwell on January 2 while the babysitter watched his two other kids, the affidavit states. Investigators confirmed this trip occurred, the affidavit states.\n \n\n   \n  He went to Home Goods and purchased three rugs, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Just after noon, prosecutors said, Brian Walshe made several more Google searches: “Hacksaw best tool to dismember,” “Can you be charged with murder without a body,” and “Can you identify a body with broken teeth.”\n \n\n   \n  According to surveillance video, Brian Walshe traveled to a Home Depot in Rockland wearing a surgical mask and gloves and made a cash purchase, the affidavit states. There, Walshe bought $450 of cleaning supplies, including mops, a bucket, tarps, goggles, a hatchet and baking soda, Beland said.\n \n\n   \n    January 3, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe allegedly made more Google searches, including “What happens to hair on a dead body,” “What is the rate of decomposition of a body found in a plastic bag compared to on a surface in the woods,” and “Can baking soda mask or make a body smell good,” prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Cell phone data tracked Brian Walshe’s whereabouts to an apartment complex in Abington at 4:27 p.m., according to prosecutors. Surveillance video shows he exited his car with a heavy garbage bag and put it into a dumpster, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  At 4:48 p.m., he traveled to another apartment complex in the same town, and at 5:10 p.m. he went to an apartment complex in a different town where he again discarded items in a dumpster, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  These garbage bags were taken away and incinerated by the time police tracked them down, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n    January 4, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe visited Home Goods and TJ Maxx to buy towels and bath mats and visited Lowe’s to buy squeegees and a trash can, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s employer, the real estate company Tishman Speyer, called police to report she did not show up for her job, according to Cohasset police logs.\n \n\n   \n  According to Brian Walshe’s defense attorney, he called her workplace to ask whether they knew of her whereabouts before the employer called police.\n \n\n   \n  Cohasset Police went to Ana Walshe’s home for a well-being check, according to an affidavit. Brian Walshe spoke with investigators multiple times and provided the above timeline for his actions and whereabouts on January 1 and 2.\n \n\n   \n  Police noticed that Brian Walshe’s vehicle had the back seats down and a plastic liner in the back of the car, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n    January 5, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Police noticed that the plastic liner was gone from Brian Walshe’s vehicle, and the carpet of the car showed fresh vacuum streaks, prosecutors said. Brian Walshe told police he threw the liner in the trash.\n \n\n   \n  Cell phone data showed Brian Walshe went to Swampscott and traveled to the corner of an apartment complex where there is a dumpster, according to prosecutors. Ten trash bags that originated from this dumpster contained blood stains, cleaning materials, a hacksaw, a hatchet, a purse and boots worn by Ana Walshe and her Covid-19 vaccination card, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n   Cohasset Police announced Ana Walshe is missing  and asked the public to come forward with any information. Police said she was last seen “shortly after midnight on New Year’s Day.”\n \n\n   \n    January 6, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Police launched a massive search for Ana Walshe that included K-9 officers and search-and-rescue teams in the wooded areas near her home.\n \n\n   \n    January 7, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Investigators received an email saying “we have her here with us” and that Ana Walshe would not be returned until she paid $127,000,  according to court documents .\n \n\n   \n  “We have the so named Ana Walshe with us here… we had a deal worth $127,000… she messed up,” read the email, which was sent from the gmail account of “richardwalker9984.” It went on to say: “We have her here with us and if she doesn’t pay the money.. then she’ll never be back, and we know that the police and the FBI are involved.. good luck finding us.”\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said the email, which was sent to a Cohasset Police Department detective, was suspicious because it did not put forth a timeline to respond to the demand and did not include contact information, according to the documents.\n \n\n   \n  At least six investigators were tasked with driving to the north shore area of Massachusetts and watching surveillance video to try to verify Walshe’s timeline of events, the affidavit states. Investigators did not observe Brian Walshe on video at the Whole Foods or CVS in Swampscott on January 1, as he had stated, the affidavit says.\n \n\n   \n  Cohasset Police and Massachusetts State Police announced the search for Ana Walshe had ended.\n \n\n   \n    January 8, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Investigators obtained a search warrant for the Walshe’s Cohasset home and found blood and a bloody knife in the basement, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arrested and charged with misleading a police investigation,  police said in a statement .\n \n\n   \n    January 9, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arraigned in court and pleaded not guilty to a charge of misleading police.\n \n\n   \n  Beland, the prosecutor, said investigators had found no evidence of Ana Walshe taking a rideshare from the couple’s home on January 1. She said his statements to police caused a delay in the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The judge set bail at $500,000 cash and set the next hearing for February 9.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors released the affidavit in support of a criminal complaint that lays out authorities’ timeline of the prior week. The affidavit describes Brian Walshe’s statements to police as a “clear attempt to mislead and delay investigators.”\n \n\n   \n  The affidavit outlines several trips he made that were not requested and approved beforehand and that may represent violations of the terms of his probation.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators conducted searches north of Boston and collected a number of items that would be processed and tested, the Norfolk district attorney said. The DA also called Ana Walshe’s disappearance “suspicious.”\n \n\n   \n  According to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation, investigators put crime scene tape around dumpsters near the home of Brian Walshe’s mother in Swampscott and dug through trash at a transfer station in Peabody. Both locations are north of Boston.\n \n\n   \n  Law enforcement sources told CNN investigators found a hacksaw, torn-up cloth material and what appears to be bloodstains at the Peabody site. The evidence was sent for testing.\n \n\n   \n    January 17, 2023\n \n\n   \n  An arrest warrant  charging Brian Walshe with murder  was issued for the death of his wife, according to  Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey .\n \n\n   \n    January 18, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arraigned in Quincy District Court on  charges of murder and disinterring of a body without authority . \n \n\n   \n  Prosecutor Beland accused him of dismembering his wife and disposing her remains in dumpsters. She also laid out some of the evidence that led to the charges, including the discovery of Ana Walshe’s belongings and blood in the garbage and Brian Walshe’s Google searches.\n \n\n   \n  A not guilty plea was entered on Brian Walshe’s behalf. His attorney at the time, Tracy Miner, issued a statement suggesting the evidence against him was not strong.\n \n\n   \n  “In my experience, where, as here, the prosecution leaks so-called evidence to the press before they provide it to me, their case isn’t that strong,” she said. “When they have a strong case, they give me everything as soon as possible. We shall see what they have and what evidence is admissible in court, where the case will ultimately be decided.”\n \n\n   \n    March 30, 2023\n \n\n   \n  A  grand jury indicts Brian Walshe  on charges of murder, misleading investigators, and improperly conveying a human body, according to a district attorney. The indictment moves the case from Quincy District Court to Norfolk County Superior Court.\n \n\n   \n    April 27, 2023\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was arraigned in Norfolk County Superior Court and pleaded not guilty to the charges. \n \n\n   \n  Prosecutor Connor laid out a spate of new details from the investigation. Among them: “Ana Walshe had taken out approximately $2.7 million in life insurance on herself, where Brian Walshe is the sole beneficiary,” Connor said. She also had a life insurance policy through her employer.\n \n\n   \n  Miner, his then-attorney, countered the prosecution’s notion that Walshe was trying to cash in on his wife’s life insurance policies. She said there is “no evidence Mr. Walshe was the least bit needing of money” and noted that his mother is wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  The judge ordered Brian Walshe to be held without bail.\n \n\n   \n    February 20, 2024\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was  sentenced to 37 months  in prison and three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay restitution of $475,000 in the federal fraud case for selling fake Andy Warhol paintings.\n \n\n   \n    November 14, 2025\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe was ruled competent to stand trial after a 40-day stint in a state hospital for mental health evaluation, Judge Diane Freniere said in Norfolk County Superior Court.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was originally slated to begin October 20 but was delayed after Walshe’s attorneys called his competency into question after he was attacked in jail in September.\n \n\n   \n    November 18, 2025\n \n\n   \n  Just before jury selection began, Brian Walshe  pleaded guilty  to misleading police and improper conveyance of a human body related to the death of his wife. The guilty plea was made without a deal with prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe faces a maximum sentence of 10 years on the misleading police charge, with up to a 20-year sentence enhancement if convicted of murder. He faces up to 3 years in prison on the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  His attorney made clear he was not admitting to the murder of his wife.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/melania-trump-usha-vance-north-carolina","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00-05:00","title":"Melania Trump teams up with Usha Vance, visiting troops in North Carolina","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melania Trump and Usha Vance made their first joint public appearance without their husbands during a visit to North Carolina military bases, marking a significant return to public engagement for Melania after a quiet start to her second term.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Melania Trump joined second lady Usha Vance on Wednesday for a pre-Thanksgiving visit with North Carolina military families, offering the latest signal that the first lady is more actively engaging with her role after a quiet start to her second term.\n \n\n   \n  The pair met with service members and their families at Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River in a trip marking their first public joint appearance without their husbands 10 months into the Trump-Vance administration.\n \n\n   \n  The visit offered a rare opportunity to see their relationship on display – and highlighted the key issues that each woman has chosen to prioritize.\n \n\n   \n  The first lady shined a light on children’s well-being and the responsible use of technologies like artificial intelligence during a classroom visit with Lejeune High School students who are participating in the presidential AI challenge. In a presentation to their guests, students detailed how they use the technology for class projects – and the rules governing that usage.\n \n\n   \n  Children’s literacy was front and center for the second lady as Trump and Vance played games and did arts and craft projects with younger children at nearby DeLalio Elementary School. Trump donned a headband with an index card as she played a reading game with the children.\n \n\n   \n  Vance offered praise to her counterpart during remarks to service members at the conclusion of their trip.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m honored to introduce our first lady, who shares my deep gratitude for your sacrifices to secure our country’s safety and its well-being,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, Vance added, is “committed to bettering our nation by ensuring that every child feels loved, supported, and prepared for the future.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how much the two women have substantively engaged with each other behind the scenes, though the Vances hosted the Trumps at the Naval Observatory for dinner last month, spending about an hour and a half at the vice presidential residence. The first lady’s office declined to respond to CNN’s inquiries about their relationship.\n \n\n   \n  But in a sign of warm relations, Usha Vance joined Melania Trump in her cabin on the flight to North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the matter. That invitation was not extended for one of her predecessors, former second lady Karen Pence, who sat instead with her staff when traveling with the first lady during the first Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Vance appeared friendly in their engagements throughout the day, sharing a handshake on stage in the hangar and telling reporters they had a “very nice visit” upon their departure.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, a  former high-powered lawyer , is navigating the delicate dynamic of being a top figurehead in a new administration alongside the first lady, who has taken  her own approach  to the spousal role.\n \n\n   \n  The second lady has joined her husband, who appears to have higher political ambitions, on key trips across the country and abroad, all while transitioning three small children to a life under the microscope and becoming a public figure with a quiet platform of children’s literacy and early childhood development.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, took a more hands-off approach to her role, spending most of her time in the first months of the president’s second term away from the White House in New York or Palm Beach, Florida, often disappearing for weeks between public appearances.\n \n\n   \n  She has a much smaller staff compared with her first term. Though she was an active steward of White House preservation during her husband’s first term, she has left many of those decision to the president this time around,  culminating dramatically  last month with the demolition of  the East Wing , which has served as headquarters for presidential spouses since the Carter administration.\n \n\n   \n  But recently, the first lady has returned to public view with a series of engagements on a range of topics.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has held events advocating for children’s well-being and artificial intelligence safety, launching a  global coalition  on the issue called “Fostering the Future Together.” She joined the president as he signed an executive order last week on a (unrelated) “Fostering the Future” initiative for children in foster care. And she back-channeled with Russian President Vladimir Putin on releasing allegedly abducted Ukrainian children with  mixed results .\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Trump honored the Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary as she looked ahead to new challenges facing the US military.\n \n\n   \n  “Technology is changing the art of war. Predictably, AI will alter war more profoundly than any technology since nuclear weapons,” she said during her remarks in the hangar.\n \n\n   \n  She continued, “Artificial intelligence will take center stage in the theater of war – it already plays a meaningful role on the battlefield. But of course, it is the Marine who will always play the most critical role in realizing mission success.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear why the first lady is choosing to reemerge now, and her office declined to respond to questions on whether this might portend a more active role. Trump recently indicated that the multimillion-dollar deal she signed with Amazon for an  eponymous documentary  highlighting her return to the White House had taken up much of her attention this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The silver screen and I have been in deep conversation lately. You may have heard the news — I produced a new film with Amazon MGM named ‘Melania,’” Trump said earlier this month in remarks accepting Fox Nation’s “Patriot of the Year” award.\n \n\n   \n  The “Melania” documentary, which will be released in January, is being directed by Brett Ratner and marks the filmmaker’s first major project since 2017, when he was  accused of sexual misconduct  by numerous women. Ratner has denied the allegations.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional reporting from Trump and Vance’s visit.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/economy/us-jobs-report-september-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:40:00-05:00","title":"What to Expect in Thursday’s Jobs Report","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The long-delayed September jobs report is finally released on November 19, 2025, after being pushed back due to a government shutdown that disrupted federal data collection.

It lands as the floodgates open for a slew of backlogged economic data that was held up due to the historic government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting on the shelf for six weeks, the months-old data has the potential to come across as stale – especially for a fast-moving economy that is  feeling increasingly perilous  for many Americans and  businesses .\n \n\n   \n  Economic uncertainty and the rising cost of living have caused consumers to pull back (as  The Home Depot  and  Target  can attest). Affordability concerns are reaching a fever pitch (so much so that President Donald Trump  exempted some grocery store items  like coffee, beef and fruit from steep tariffs).\n \n\n   \n  However, the end of the federal data drought provides a much-needed look at how the economy fared in recent weeks and what’s in store for the months to come.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, Thursday’s report might very well be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since the  shutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during October  and part of November.\n \n\n   \n  And on Wednesday we learned that some of that October jobs data – the payroll numbers from the establishment survey – will be included with the November jobs report that’s pushed back to December 16, from December 5. The household survey data was not able to be collected, BLS said.\n \n\n   \n  As such, Thursday’s jobs report will provide a critical baseline of the US labor market entering the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Economists are expecting 50,000 jobs were added in September and that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.3%, according to FactSet. The consensus estimates would mark a pickup from  August’s preliminary 22,000-job gain .\n \n\n   \n  If September job gains come in as expected at 50,000, they will keep this year on course for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.   \n \n\n   \n  “I’m not expecting huge changes in the (September) report, relative to past reports,” said Allison Shrivastava, economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. “I really just expect this continuation of this anemic job market that we’ve seen.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been a low-hire, low-fire slog of a labor market where the lion’s share of job gains has occurred in health care and social services.\n \n\n   \n  That trend was largely confirmed by a  host of private sector  labor market data released during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Still, while economists aren’t expecting many surprises, Thursday’s report doesn’t come without some fairly big risks – especially for the consideration of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates by a quarter point on October 29 with a backdrop of a “less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Anything that looks kind of ugly now has had the potential to fester for a little bit longer, for the six weeks before we got a better eye on it,” Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A precarious place’\n \n\n   \n  Job growth was expected to slow following the post-pandemic economic recovery; however, it’s been  practically listless  the past several months. Since May, job gains have averaged 31,000 per month, which is about one-fifth of the average seen in 2024, BLS data shows.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in this place of such uncertainty because there’s so much change in policy,” Shrivastava said, noting the frequently changing tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  The economy has continued to expand in recent months and consumer spending has held up; however, it’s wealthier Americans who are propping up those outlays.\n \n\n   \n  “This is already a pretty precarious spending situation that could really topple,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The bifurcation (also widely known as  K-shaped  or two-lane) in the spending environment has further contributed to the bifurcation in the labor market. Aside from health care, social services and leisure and hospitality (to some extent), job gains have been flat or negative in many industries, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to uncertainty around trade policy, factors such as immigration, artificial intelligence, federal employment and funding cuts, high interest rates and pandemic-era overhiring are serving as headwinds, she said.\n \n\n   \n  And that in turn, will continue to put downward pressure on wages and serve as barriers for people trying to break into or re-enter the labor market, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Continuing jobless claims, which are submitted by people who have filed for at least a week or more of unemployment, have been hovering at around four-year highs, Department of Labor data shows. The latest claims data, which was filled in partially this week, showed that continuing claims were 1.957 million as of October 18, the highest since August.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in a precarious place, we’re in an anemic place, but not necessarily something wholly negative,” Shrivastava said.\n \n\n   \n    A more ‘upbeat’ outlook for 2026\n \n\n   \n  Still, layoff activity hasn’t worrisomely accelerated: First-time claims for unemployment benefits were 232,000 as of October 18, a tally that was in line with September.\n \n\n   \n  If claims are “in the order of, 300,000 to 400,000 and once we kind of are consistently above that level, then I’d start to be a little more worried about the job market in general,” Oren Klachkin, financial market economist at Nationwide, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, Klachkin and other Nationwide economists “don’t see a recession on the horizon anytime soon.”\n \n\n   \n  “If I had to put a metaphor around it, it’s like we’re at the end stages of a marathon for the labor market,” Klachkin said. “We came out of the pandemic with extremely robust gains in job growth, and now we’re reaching the end stages of this so-called race, where the job market is looking a bit softer, a bit slower and is potentially at risk, just given where we are in the cycle.”\n \n\n   \n  The labor market is vulnerable to a crash-out; however, the odds are still in favor of it trudging across the finish line and to a point where it could get refueled early next year by increased certainty around tariff rates as well as a potential fiscal boost from the tax and spending bill.\n \n\n   \n  “In the earnings results for the third quarter, the corporate sector is still essentially signaling that we can be relatively upbeat about the economy into next year,” Klachkin said.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated to include additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/americas/us-military-deployment-support-caribbean-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"What we know of the countries backing US military moves in the Caribbean","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is conducting a broad military and diplomatic campaign in the Caribbean, including joint naval exercises in Trinidad and Tobago, air operations in El Salvador, and regional coordination with several Latin American countries.

By Gonzalo Zegarra, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:18 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United States shared images on Wednesday of joint military exercises in  Trinidad and Tobago , as its armed forces amass in the region, building pressure on  Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro .\n \n\n   \n  The deployment is receiving logistical and diplomatic support from multiple Latin American countries, ranging from limited assistance to open cooperation with to US forces.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s more on who’s backing the US operation in the Caribbean, which Washington says is meant to combat drug trafficking in the region:\n \n\n   \n    Trinidad and Tobago\n \n\n   \n  Trinidad and Tobago, which is only 11 kilometers (7 miles) from Venezuela at its closest point, has declared its full support for the US operation.\n \n\n   \n  “I, along with most of the country, am happy that the US naval deployment is having success in their mission,” Trinidadian Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar said in early September, after the US launched its first attack on an  alleged drug vessel  in the Caribbean. “I have no sympathy for traffickers; the US military should kill them all violently,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  After the US began the deployment in August, Persad-Bissessar also warned that if Venezuela attacks Guyana, a country with which it has a  territorial dispute , she would grant the US government access for defense operations. The declaration showed her willingness to abandon a yearslong policy of neutrality and a pragmatic relationship with Venezuela based on economic interests.\n \n\n   \n  In late October, the US Navy destroyer USS Gravely carried out military drills in Trinidad and Tobago for several days, a move that the Venezuelan government called “a hostile provocation.” Maduro responded by announcing the suspension of bilateral gas agreements with the country, claiming its prime minister was threatening to turn Trinidad and Tobago into “the aircraft carrier of the US empire against Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n    Guyana\n \n\n   \n  Guyana backed the US military deployment in the Caribbean shortly after it started in August, saying it would support a “collaborative and integrated approach to tackle transnational organized crime.”\n \n\n   \n  It added that transnational organized crime was a “threat to peace and security in the region” and involved networks like “the Cartel de los Soles of Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  Washington claims Cartel de los Soles is led by Maduro and is responsible for trafficking drugs to the US and Europe. Caracas has dismissed the accusation as a “fabrication.” But experts and former US government officials  say the group is not a  formally organized cartel, and it’s a stretch to suggest Maduro leads it, though there is government involvement in the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  The head of US Southern Command Admiral Alvin Holsey visited Guyana this month to promote regional security and met with senior commanders to discuss a long-standing defense alliance between both countries, the US Embassy said.\n \n\n   \n    El Salvador\n \n\n   \n  In early November, an AC-130J military aircraft operated by the US Air Force was spotted in El Salvador’s Comalapa Cooperative Security Base, according to photos and satellite imagery obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The gunship can carry Hellfire missiles but is primarily armed with large-caliber cannons. The AC-130J seen in El Salvador had two cannons – including a 105mm howitzer – visible its left side.\n \n\n   \n  Until recently, the Salvadoran base had been used almost exclusively for unarmed aircraft, according to the US Southern Command. Its location near the coast provides a strategic position for the US campaign in the Pacific, as the reach of bases in the Caribbean is limited.\n \n\n   \n  “Operating from Comalapa offers more options and allows for monitoring and defending a much wider swath of the Pacific Ocean, through which much of the cocaine trafficked to the United States passes,” Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN earlier in  November. \n \n\n   \n  Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has not commented specifically on the US military deployment, but he has a close relationship with US President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n    Panama\n \n\n   \n  US military personnel are conducting training exercises in Panama, although the government of President José Raúl Mulino is trying to downplay the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The president denied last week that his country is participating in any “hostile act against Venezuela” and asserted that the military maneuvers are part of bilateral cooperation agreements with Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Panama, which has not had armed forces since 1990, has hosted military exercises since the  US invasion of the country in 1989 . In April, Panama signed a memorandum of cooperation enabling a greater US military presence and authorizing the use of air and naval bases for joint exercises. Mulino again denied that the activities are related to the White House’s pressure on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n    Dominican Republic\n \n\n   \n  President Luis Abinader said Monday that the Dominican Republic and the US Drug Enforcement Administration would launch “much more extensive and in-depth” actions in the fight against drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  That same day, Dominican authorities said they boarded a speedboat with 806 packages of suspected cocaine off the coast of Pedernales. The National Drug Control Directorate said the intervention was in support of Operation Southern Spear, the name the Pentagon uses for the military deployment in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The collaboration had already begun on Saturday, when authorities seized another shipment of nearly 500 packages of cocaine on a speedboat.\n \n\n   \n    Puerto Rico and other bases\n \n\n   \n  Puerto Rico, a self-governing US territory in the Caribbean, also plays a key role in the deployment, as it contains the most US military bases in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n   Satellite imagery and photographs  taken in the area show that Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which had been closed since 2004, is now operational again, and that US Marines supporting the Southern Command missions participated in amphibious landing drills in the archipelago in late September.\n \n\n   \n  The United States has two other bases in and around the Caribbean, but in both cases, the countries where they’re located have spoken out against the deployment.\n \n\n   \n  In southeastern Cuba, the Guantanamo Naval Base has been used for logistical, surveillance, and other operations since 1903, but the Cuban government, an ally of Venezuela, has repeatedly rejected the US military presence as well as its recent deployment.\n \n\n   \n  Washington also has an air base in Honduras staffed by more than 500 US military personnel and 500 Honduran and American civilians, according to its website. In January, before Trump took office, Honduran President Xiomara Castro threatened to reconsider the use of the base if the US carried out mass deportations. In August, she called some of Washington’s accusations against Maduro “unfounded” and later spoke out against the US military deployment in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n    Political support\n \n\n   \n  Countries in South America have shown political support for Washington’s pressure campaign on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Ecuador designated Cartel de los Soles as an “organized crime terrorist group.” The decree was signed by President Daniel Noboa, an ally of Washington, whose attempts to lift a ban on foreign military bases was rejected in a recent referendum.\n \n\n   \n  Paraguay and Argentina, other White House allies, have also designated Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/climate/trump-endangered-species-act-protection-roll-back","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:36:00-05:00","title":"Trump moves to strip protections for endangered and threatened species","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has proposed rolling back protections for endangered and threatened species under the Endangered Species Act by reinstating rules from its first term that prioritize economic development over species conservation.

But new research challenges recent claims about the risks of fluoride in drinking water — and instead suggests that it may have additional positive effects.\n \n\n   \n  The heightened federal debate was spurred by a  recent government study  from the National Toxicology Program that concluded that high levels of fluoride exposure are linked to lower IQ in children, but that study evaluated fluoride exposures that were at least twice the federally recommended limits with notably “ insufficient data ” to determine the effects of lower levels.\n \n\n   \n  The new study looked at more typical, recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water and instead found “robust evidence” that young people exposed to fluoride at these lower levels actually performed better on ​cognitive tests than their peers who did not have fluoride in their drinking water.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Rob Warren, lead author of the  study published in the journal Science Advances  on Wednesday, said he was “shocked” by the findings from the National Toxicology Program study and motivated to provide research that was more relevant to public policy decisions.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t have done this work had it not been an empirical question that I didn’t think we had an answer to, of great immediate policy interest,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called fluoride “an industrial waste” and cited “IQ loss” in  pledges  to roll back federal recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water.  Utah  and  Florida  have become the first two states to ban the practice.\n \n\n   \n  “Imagine testing some new drug for heart disease and the recommended dosage is 100 milligrams, and then your study compares people who get a million milligrams to people who get half a million milligrams. Well, that doesn’t tell you anything about the effect of getting 100 milligrams versus getting nothing,” Warren said. “That’s kind of the world we’re in with fluoride research. It’s important to know that if you get a toxic dose, really bad things happen to your body, but that’s not relevant for the public policy discussion.”\n \n\n   \n  Warren, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, leads a program that started in the US Department of Education and has followed a cohort of tens of thousands of people for more than four decades since their high school years in the 1980s.\n \n\n   \n  For the new study, he and other researchers used this data to overlay performance on mathematics, reading and vocabulary tests for a nationally representative sample of nearly 27,000 people with their exposure to fluoride in community drinking water based on historical data from HHS and the US Geological Survey.\n \n\n   \n  The analysis assumed that individuals lived near their high school for their whole childhood and grouped them based on whether they would have been consistently exposed to recommended fluoride levels through community water fluoridation or natural occurrence of the mineral, consistently lacking exposure to fluoride, or partly exposed if their community changed their local fluoridation policy at some point during their childhood.\n \n\n   \n  Students who were exposed to fluoride for part of their childhood had higher test scores in high school than those who had no exposure to fluoride, and the difference was even greater for those who were exposed to fluoride for their whole childhood, the study found. Follow-up tests continued through 2021, when most participants had reached 60 years of age, and suggested that fluoride exposure also did not contribute to cognitive decline as participants aged.\n \n\n   \n  Cognitive tests are not direct measures of IQ. There is a strong correlation, Warren says, but cognitive tests measure a mix of how well someone’s brain works along with the opportunities they’ve had to learn the material. He’s working on additional research that will directly assess the link between fluoride and IQ, with more precise measurements data about where the individuals lived during childhood, too.\n \n\n   \n  Other  research  from this year estimated that removing fluoride from public water in the US would lead to 25.4 million excess decayed teeth in children and adolescents within five years, along with $9.8 billion in health care costs. The new study did not measure individual dental health, but experts say that pain from tooth decay can cause children to have trouble focusing in school or miss it completely — which could be a factor affecting cognitive test scores.\n \n\n   \n  Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth. The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way.\n \n\n   \n  The American Dental Association and many experts have continued to support the practice of community water fluoridation, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not changed its recommendations. The agency cannot mandate that communities add fluoride to their water, but it considers 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water to be the “optimal level.”\n \n\n   \n  But the US Food and Drug Administration recently  took action  to restrict the use of prescription fluoride supplements. “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a news release about the action.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Bruce Lanphear, an epidemiologist and professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, said it’s important to capture a more complete set of all sources of fluoride exposures, such as toothpaste and pesticides.\n \n\n   \n  “Population strategies – like fluoridation, like vaccination, like taking lead out of gasoline – they can be extraordinarily powerful. If you’ve got a safe and effective intervention, you can have a big impact on the health of populations,” he said. “But when you have a population strategy like fluoridation, the evidence about its safety and about its effectiveness has to be extraordinarily strong.”\n \n\n   \n  But in a  formal response  to the new research that was also published in Science Advances on Wednesday, Dr. David Savitz, an epidemiologist with the Brown University School of Public Health, argues that the greater burden lies on proving the risk before ending a public health practice that has been successful for decades.\n \n\n   \n  “Until clear evidence exists that water fluoridation lacks public health benefit or compelling evidence of harm at the level of fluoride exposure in fluoridated water, neither of which has occurred, it seems foolhardy to interfere with a long-established and well-recognized public health success,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “With due credit to the folk wisdom of Bert Lance, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Jimmy Carter, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ Warren and colleagues move the needle a bit further into the ‘ain’t broke’ range.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/latino-population-us-tradition-identity-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"Latino Identity in the U.S.: Growth, Tradition, and Tension Amid Anti-Immigration Policies","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the evolving identity and influence of the Latino population in the United States, which now stands at over 68 million and is the largest racial minority group.

policies, the US Latino population grows and cultural traditions remain \n       \n  By Karen Esquivel and graphics by Jhasua Razo, CNN en Español\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:07 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a country where some 68 million Latin Americans — nearly 20% of the population — are redefining their place in public life, Latino identity in the United States is at a turning point. Growth no longer depends primarily on immigration, but rather on a native-born generation that is transforming priorities and expectations.\n \n\n   \n  But this shift is occurring amid a harsher immigration policy. There have been  more than 500,000 deportations  and over  1.6 million voluntary self-deportations  since January 2025. That reality is impacting the economies of entire neighborhoods, increasing community tensions, and reshaping the political landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Between the growing presence of an increasingly younger population that still celebrates its origins and traditions and the pressure of historically aggressive measures, the question of what it means to be Latino in the US today is taking on new layers of complexity. Who are they, where do they come from, and how do they live?\n \n\n   \n  Many Hispanics feel more connected to the United States but remain tied to their country of origin’s traditions: food, language ,  and festivities are some of the customs they preserve, according to responses to a CNN survey answered by more than 120 readers, all Latino residents in the U . S.\n \n\n   \n  Sara Sánchez says she still enjoys Salvadoran food such as pupusas and in December celebrates Christmas Eve on December 24 and Christmas the following day with traditional dishes and music from her homeland.\n \n\n   \n  Arepas, for example, are still the preferred food of many Colombians and Venezuelans throughout the United States. Mexicans eat pozole, tacos, or beans on any given day, and Nicaraguans enjoy gallo pinto, a traditional dish that contains rice, beans, chili ,  and onion.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico’s Independence Day or Día de Muertos are celebrated by people who trace their origins to Mexico; some Colombians maintain religious celebrations such as Día de las Velitas or Colombia’s traditional Christmas festivities with their respective traditional dishes. Venezuelan music, especially Gaitas in December, is present in homes and gatherings.\n \n\n   \n    Diversity of origin\n \n\n   \n  The growing Latino community in the United States reached a record of over 68 million in 2024, according to  Census Bureau figures . This means its population is larger than that of countries such as Spain, Canada ,  and any other in Latin America except Brazil (over 211 million) and Mexico (130 million).\n \n\n   \n  Historically, the Mexican population has been the largest Hispanic group in the United States. In 2024, they totaled 38.9 million (11.5%), a significant increase compared to the 35.9 million counted in 2020,  according to Census data .\n \n\n   \n  Second are Puerto Ricans, with 6.1 million (1.8%); followed by Cubans with 2.9 million (0.9%), Salvadorans with 2.7 million, and Dominicans with 2.5 million as of last year.\n \n\n   \n  Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States. For this reason, Puerto Ricans have been U . S .  citizens by birth since 1917, but they  do not have the same rights  as other citizens of the country: They cannot vote in presidential elections and do not have representation in Congress. They are considered part of the Latino community because the U . S .  government  defines this group  as the population that speaks Spanish or descends from Latin Americans or Spaniards.\n \n\n   \n  People with roots in Central and South America have registered a significant increase, with two populations — Colombia and Honduras — that for the first time since 2010 surpassed the one million mark, while the Venezuelan population reported the fastest growth of Hispanic groups, with an increase of 181% from 2010 to 2020, according to the Census.\n \n\n   \n  The Mexican population is the largest Hispanic group in 40 states, but has settled mainly in California, a state that recorded more than 12.2 million Mexicans as of 2020, according to the Census, followed by Texas (9 million) and Arizona (1.8 million). Their presence and reach in the country have been such that in the 1960s the Chicano movement was born with the objective of empowering the U . S .  population of Mexican descent and was focused in the southwestern United States.\n \n\n   \n  Chicano murals, for example, stand out in neighborhoods in California, Texas ,  and Arizona as a window into the labor struggle, social justice, Mexican Independence, migration, historical figures, pre-Hispanic symbols, and daily life. In Sacramento, California, there is one of the oldest Chicano murals in the country called “The Rise of the Chicano Social Struggle in a Bicultural Society.” These works, created by local artists, are a symbol of resistance and pride for the Latino community.\n \n\n   \n    The South of the U.S. is home to the largest number of Latinos\n \n\n   \n  Geographically, California, Texas, and Florida are the  states with the largest Latino populations , but this group has expanded beyond traditional enclaves, settling in areas of the Midwest and the South where the Latino population was historically scarce.\n \n\n   \n  These three states are clear examples of the settlement and expansion of the Latino community. As of 2024, California’s total population was more than 39.4 million people, of which more than 16 million were Latinos (40%) and more than 10 million were immigrants (27%),  according to data  from the Public Policy Institute of California.\n \n\n   \n  In Texas, a state with more than  31.2 million inhabitants , there are 12.6 million Hispanics (40%), surpassing the White population (39.8%), according to Census data. This means that the Latino community is the largest demographic group in the country’s second largest state.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Florida is home to 6.7 million Hispanics (28.7%) among its more than 23.3 million residents. The Latino community is also the second-largest ethnic group in the so-called Sunshine State.\n \n\n   \n    Enduring customs\n \n\n   \n  Rodríguez lives in a Latino community in San Francisco, California, a state where Hispanics of Mexican origin make up more than 12% of the population, which  —  she says  —  reminds her a lot of Mexico. “Here, there are many street vendors on the streets and they sell all kinds of food, especially on weekends, you find everything: There are pupusas, tamales, tacos, anything. It’s not something you see in other places in the United States, but it reminds me a lot of Mexico,” she explains.\n \n\n   \n  Gastronomy is one of the areas where Latinos of Mexican origin have made a strong presence. According to  data from Pew Research Center , one in 10 restaurants in the United States serves Mexican food and 85% of counties nationwide have at least one Mexican restaurant.\n \n\n   \n  Clemente López replied that he feels more connected to the United States, but he prefers the food of Honduras, his country of origin, as well as the music and soccer.\n \n\n   \n  Paola Acosta, originally from Colombia and a resident of Florida, came to the U . S .  15 years ago in search of the so-called American dream. For her, the connection to her country of origin is greater and is reflected in her traditional diet: arepas, sancocho ,  and rice are on her table every day.\n \n\n   \n  And for Marabeth Márquez, the religious traditions of Venezuela are still present in her life in the United States with celebrations such as Christmas Eve on December 24, observing Lent and fasting during Holy Week, in addition to not having adopted holidays like Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  One in every five inhabitants in the United States is Latino (20%), making this group the largest racial minority in the country. Although immigration has historically been a determining factor in this increase, now the births of people of Latino origin have taken first place: just between 2022 and 2023, there were 722,000 births recorded, compared to 437,000 migrants who arrived in the country,  according to official figures. \n \n\n   \n  Gina López is a clear example: She was born in New York but feels more identified with the traditions of Colombia, her parents’ country of origin. She now lives in Florida.\n \n\n   \n    Soccer, a sport that connects roots\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of their flag of origin, Latinos in the United States prefer soccer over other sports because it is an extension of their national identity that connects them to their roots. This sport, favored in Latin America, has expanded and gained popularity in the country.\n \n\n   \n  While in 1997, soccer was tied for last place on the list of favorite sports along with figure skating, by 2023, it had climbed to fourth place, just behind American football, baseball, and basketball,  according to a Gallup poll.  Hispanic television viewers in the U . S .  represented the vast majority of soccer’s audience in 2017, with 68% of viewers that year, according to another  study from Nielsen. \n \n\n   \n  Talking about this sport among the Hispanic population has another important nuance: Latinos who prefer soccer tend to support teams outside the United States. According to a  2024 report  from the marketing and media company For Soccer, 32% of Hispanics consider the U . S .  men’s national soccer team their favorite, while 21% prefer the women’s team. However, among Mexican Americans — the largest Hispanic group in the United States — only 40% have one of these U . S .  teams as their favorite, which means that most of them prefer other teams, from Mexico or other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Soccer has become a cultural meeting point and a common language for many Colombians, Mexicans, Ecuadorians, Salvadorans ,  and Venezuelans, mainly in states such as Florida, California and Texas, according to Latinos who responded to CNN’s questionnaire. An example of this is that the states hosting the most Major League Soccer teams — the US professional soccer league — are California, Texas and Florida, which are also the states with the largest Latino populations.\n \n\n   \n  Paola Acosta, a Florida resident, noted that not only is soccer her favorite sport, but she is also a fan of the Colombian national team, her country of origin. And John Jauregui, who was born in California and traces his origin to Mexico, prefers soccer over other sports.\n \n\n   \n  That said, American football and baseball have also become integral parts of the lives of many Latinos in the United States. According to the NFL, by early 2025 there were  39 million  Latino fans in the U . S . , and according to  Nielsen data , the percentage of Hispanic viewers of the Super Bowl increased from 10% in 2016 to 14% in 2024. Meanwhile, the percentage for the World Series went from 10% in 2016 to 15% in 2023.\n \n\n   \n    Spanish language, important in identity\n \n\n   \n  Latinos still maintain Spanish as a way to communicate at home and with close family and friends, in addition to considering it an important part of their identity and traditions. In fact, the United States is already the  second country with the most Spanish speakers  in the world, according to the report “Spanish: A Living Language 2024,” with just over 57.4 million Spanish speakers, second only to Mexico.\n \n\n   \n  But as the Hispanic population is increasingly made up of individuals born in the U . S . , the proportion of Latinos who speak English fluently is growing. In 2022, 72% of Latinos age 5 or older spoke the language fluently, compared to 59% in 2000,  according to the Pew Research Center. \n \n\n   \n  Additionally, the proportion of Latinos who speak Spanish at home decreased from 78% in 2000 to 68% in 2022, a figure driven mainly by those born in the United States.\n \n\n   \n    Latinos, a driving force in the economy\n \n\n   \n  Hispanics are a key part and engine in the economic development of the United States and will become even more relevant as the rest of the population ages in the coming decades, according to an  analysis by the Latino Donor Collaborative and Arizona State University. \n \n\n   \n  The Latino Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United States increased from $2.1 trillion in 2015 to $4 trillion in 2023, according to the report, which is equivalent to being the fifth largest economy in the world, behind only the U . S . , China, Germany ,  and Japan, and above the United Kingdom, France ,  and Italy.\n \n\n   \n  “The magic and secret power, the superpower of the Latino community is the ability to be so diverse, to come from different countries in Latin America and from Spain, but at the same time have certain characteristics that also unite us, such as the great entrepreneurial spirit and the way our community continues to contribute to all aspects of life and American society,” said Frankie Miranda, of Hispanic Federation.\n \n\n   \n  Latinos in the United States are much more than a statistic: They are a force that transforms the country, drives its economy, and renews its culture. They are increasingly American, but their identity is strengthened by traditions and pride, and they are key to the future of the nation, a future that is also expressed in Spanish.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/health/tierra-walker-death-texas-propublica","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-05","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00.000Z","title":"How Social Media Is Reshaping Interpersonal Relationships in the Modern Era","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent news article explores how social media has transformed interpersonal relationships in the modern era.

She died after she couldn’t get an abortion in Texas \n       \n  By Kavitha Surana and Lizzie Presser, ProPublica; Photography by Lexi Parra for ProPublica\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:12 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   This story was originally published by  ProPublica . \n \n\n   \n   ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive  its biggest stories  as soon as they’re published. \n \n\n   \n  Tierra Walker had reached her limit. In the weeks since she’d learned she was pregnant, the 37-year-old dental assistant had been wracked by unexplained seizures and mostly confined to a hospital cot. With soaring blood pressure and diabetes, she knew she was at high risk of developing preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication that could end her life.\n \n\n   \n  Her mind was made up on the morning of Oct. 14, 2024: For the sake of her 14-year-old son, JJ, she needed to ask her doctor for an abortion to protect her health.\n \n\n   \n  “Wouldn’t you think it would be better for me to not have the baby?” she asked a physician at Methodist Hospital Northeast near San Antonio, according to her aunt. Just a few years earlier, Walker had developed a dangerous case of preeclampsia that had led to the stillbirth of her twins.\n \n\n   \n  But the doctor, her family said, told her what many other medical providers would say in the weeks that followed: There was no emergency; nothing was wrong with her pregnancy, only her health.\n \n\n   \n  Just after Christmas, on his birthday, JJ found his mom draped over her bed, lifeless. An autopsy would later confirm what she had feared: Preeclampsia killed her at 20 weeks pregnant.\n \n\n   \n  Walker’s death is one of multiple cases ProPublica is investigating in which women with underlying health conditions died after they were unable to end their pregnancies.\n \n\n   \n  Walker had known that abortion was illegal in Texas, but she had thought that hospitals could make an exception for patients like her, whose health was at risk.\n \n\n   \n  The reality: In states that ban abortion, patients with chronic conditions and other high-risk pregnancies often have nowhere to turn.\n \n\n   \n  They enter pregnancy sick and are expected to get sicker. Yet lawmakers who wrote the bans have refused to create exceptions for health risks. As a result, many hospitals and doctors, facing the threat of criminal charges, no longer offer these patients terminations, ProPublica found in interviews with more than 100 OB-GYNs across the country. Instead, these women are left to gamble with their lives.\n \n\n   \n  As Walker’s blood pressure swung wildly and a blood clot threatened to kill her, she continued to press doctors at prenatal appointments and emergency room visits, asking if it was safe for her to continue the pregnancy. Although one doctor documented in her medical record that she was at “high risk of clinical deterioration and/or death,” she was told over and over again that she didn’t need to worry, her relatives say. More than 90 doctors were involved in Walker’s care, but not one offered her the option to end her pregnancy, according to medical records.\n \n\n   \n  Walker’s case unfolded during the fall of 2024, when the dangers of abortion bans were a focus of protests, media coverage and electoral campaigns across the country. ProPublica had revealed that five women —  three   in Texas   alone  — had died after they were unable to access standard reproductive care under the new bans.\n \n\n   \n  ProPublica condensed more than 6,500 pages of Walker’s medical records into a summary of her care with the guidance of two high-risk pregnancy specialists. More than a dozen OB-GYNs reviewed the case for ProPublica and said that since Walker had persistently high blood pressure, it would have been standard medical practice to advise her of the serious risks of her pregnancy early on, to revisit the conversation as new complications emerged and to offer termination at any point if she wanted it. Some described her condition as a “ticking time bomb.” Had Walker ended her pregnancy, every expert believed, she would not have died.\n \n\n   \n  Many said that her case illustrated why they think all patients need the freedom to choose how much risk they are willing to take during pregnancy. Walker expressed that she didn’t want to take that risk, her family says. She had a vibrant life, a husband and son whom she loved.\n \n\n   \n  Under Texas’ abortion law, though, that didn’t matter.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I don’t know how much more I can take’\n \n\n   \n  On a hot September day, Walker was lying down with JJ after a walk with their two small dogs, Milo and Twinkie, when she started shaking uncontrollably.\n \n\n   \n  Terrified, JJ called 911, asking for an ambulance.\n \n\n   \n  As the only child of a single mom, JJ had always considered Walker his closest friend, coach and protector wrapped in one. In their mobile home, JJ was greeted each morning by his mom’s wide smile and upturned eyes, as she shot off vocabulary quizzes or grilled him on state capitals. He loved how fearlessly she went after what she wanted; in 2021, she had proposed to her boyfriend, Eric Carson, and the two eloped. She’d just been talking about moving the family to Austin for a promotion she was offered at a dental clinic.\n \n\n   \n  At the hospital, JJ was shocked to see her so pale and helpless, with wires snaking from her head and arms.\n \n\n   \n  To Walker’s surprise, doctors quickly discovered that she was five weeks pregnant. They also noted hypertension at levels so high that it reduces circulation to major organs and can cause a heart attack or stroke. That, and her weight, age and medical history, put Walker at an increased risk of developing preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related blood pressure disorder, said Dr. Jennifer Lewey, director of the Penn Women’s Cardiovascular Health Program and expert in hypertension.\n \n\n   \n  “If I’m seeing a patient in her first trimester and her blood pressure is this uncontrolled — never mind anything else — what I’m talking about is: Your pregnancy will be so high risk, do we need to think about terminating the pregnancy and getting your health under control?”\n \n\n   \n  As Walker’s first trimester continued, she kept seizing. Her body convulsed, her eyes rolled back and she was often unable to speak for up to 30 minutes at a time. Some days, the episodes came in rapid waves, with little relief.\n \n\n   \n  For three weeks, she stayed at Methodist hospitals; doctors were not able to determine what was causing the spasms. Walker couldn’t get out of bed, in case a seizure made her fall, and this left her vulnerable to blood clots. She soon developed one in her leg that posed a new lethal threat: It could travel to her lungs and kill her instantly.\n \n\n   \n  Carson watched over her during the day and her aunt Latanya Walker took the night shift. She was panicked that her tough niece, whose constant mantra was “quit your crying,” now seemed defeated. One evening, during Walker’s third hospitalization, when she was about 9 weeks pregnant, she told Latanya she’d had a vision during a seizure: Her grandmother and aunt, who had died years earlier, were preparing a place for her on the other side.\n \n\n   \n  “You better tell them you’re not ready to go,” Latanya said.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how much more I can take of this,” Walker whispered.\n \n\n   \n  The next morning, Walker called for a doctor and asked about ending her pregnancy for the sake of her health. “When we get you under control, then everything will go smoothly,” the doctor replied, Latanya recalled. The physician on the floor was not an OB-GYN with the expertise to give a high-risk consultation, but the Walkers didn’t realize that this mattered. By the time the doctor left the room, her aunt said, tears streamed down Walker’s cheeks.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Elizabeth Langen, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in Michigan who reviewed Walker’s case, said a physician comfortable with high-risk pregnancies should have counseled her on the dangers of continuing and offered her an abortion. “The safest thing for her was to terminate this pregnancy, that’s for sure.”\n \n\n   \n  During Walker’s many hospital and prenatal visits, 21 OB-GYNs were among the more than 90 physicians involved in her care. None of them counseled her on the option — or the health benefits — of a termination, according to medical records.\n \n\n   \n  In Texas, the law bars “aiding and abetting” an illegal abortion. As a result, many physicians have avoided even mentioning it, according to interviews with dozens of doctors.\n \n\n   \n  In her condition, Walker couldn’t fathom leaving the state. When her aunt suggested ordering abortion medication online, Walker was worried she could go to jail. She was spending so much time in the hospital; what if she got caught taking the pills?\n \n\n   \n  At 12 weeks pregnant, she was admitted to University Hospital. Doctors there noted that even on anticoagulation medication, the clotting in Walker’s leg was so profound that she needed a thrombectomy to remove it.\n \n\n   \n  “At this point, we’ve gone from ‘complicated, but within the realm of normal’ to ‘we’ve got someone with a major procedure in pregnancy that tells us something isn’t going well,’” said Dr. Will Williams, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in New Orleans, where an abortion ban is also in place. “In my practice, we’d have a frank discussion about whether this is a person we’d offer a termination to at the point of thrombectomy.”\n \n\n   \n  ProPublica reached out to five physicians who were involved in key moments of Walker’s care: the hospitalist on duty on Oct. 14, 2024, when she asked about ending her pregnancy; three OB-GYNs; and a hospitalist on duty at the time of her thrombectomy. They did not respond. The hospitals Walker visited, including those run by University Health System and Methodist Healthcare, which is co-owned by HCA, did not comment on Walker’s care, despite permission from her family. Although the Walkers have not pursued legal action, they have engaged a lawyer. A University Health System spokesperson said that it is the company’s policy not to comment on potential litigation.\n \n\n   \n  In her second trimester, Walker’s seizures continued and her hypertension remained out of control. At an appointment on Dec. 27, at around 20 weeks, a doctor noted spiking blood pressure and sent her to University Hospital’s ER. There, doctors recorded a diagnosis of preeclampsia.\n \n\n   \n  The experts who reviewed Walker’s vital signs for ProPublica said her blood pressure of 174 over 115 was so concerning at that point, she needed to be admitted and monitored. Most questioned her doctor’s choice not to label her condition as severe. The treatment for severe preeclampsia, which points to a problem with the placenta, is delivery — or, at 20 weeks, an abortion.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, doctors lowered her blood pressure with medication and sent her home.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, JJ crawled into bed with his mom and fed her soup. “I’m so sorry,” Walker croaked. “It’s your birthday and it shouldn’t be like this.”\n \n\n   \n  He told his mom it was okay. He hadn’t expected laser tag or a trip to Dave & Buster’s this year. Over the past few months, when his mom was home, he had tried his best to make things easier on her, walking the dogs when she was out of breath, checking in every hour or so with a hug. JJ knew that after missing so many days of work, she had lost her job. She was stressed about getting enough food for the house. He was relieved when he heard her snoring — at least she was resting.\n \n\n   \n  That afternoon, when his stepdad was out grocery shopping and his grandmother was just getting back from dialysis, he cracked open the door to Walker’s room.\n \n\n   \n  His mom was lying face-down in bed, as if she had fallen over while getting up. JJ ran over and tried to find any sign she was breathing. When he called 911, a dispatcher coached him to slide her to the rug and start CPR.\n \n\n   \n  “I need you,” he shouted as he leaned over his mom, pressing down on her chest. “I need you!”\n \n\n   \n    ‘We have to allow for more exceptions’\n \n\n   \n  The anti-abortion activists who helped shape America’s latest wave of abortion bans have long seen health exemptions as a loophole that would get in the way of their goals. They fear such exceptions, if included in the laws, would  allow virtually anyone to terminate a pregnancy .\n \n\n   \n  In Idaho, an anti-abortion leader testifying at a state Senate hearing suggested doctors would use health exceptions to give abortions to patients with headaches.\n \n\n   \n  In South Dakota, a pregnant Republican lawmaker with a high risk of blood clots begged her colleagues to consider creating a health exception that would protect her; her bill never made it to a hearing.\n \n\n   \n  In Tennessee, an anti-abortion lobbyist with no medical training fought and defeated an amendment to the state law that would allow a health exception to “prevent” an emergency. He testified in the state Capitol that the carve-out was too broad since some pregnancy complications “work themselves out.”\n \n\n   \n  The refusal to entertain these broader exceptions is particularly consequential given the state of women’s health. Women are entering pregnancy older and sicker than they have in decades. The rate of blood pressure disorders in pregnancy has more than doubled since 1993; they now affect up to 15% of U.S. pregnancies. And they’re most prevalent in states with restrictive abortion policies, according to a 2023  study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology . The burden of disease falls heaviest on Black women, like Walker, for an array of reasons: neighborhood disinvestment, poor access to health care and discrimination in the medical system. Cuts to Medicaid funding and changes to the Affordable Care Act are likely to exacerbate these problems, according to experts.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries give pregnant women and their doctors far more control over the medical decision to terminate. Across Europe, for example, most laws permit abortion for any reason through the first trimester, when more than 90% of abortions occur. After that gestational limit, their statutes also tend to include broad health exceptions that can be used for chronic conditions, illnesses that develop in pregnancy, fetal anomalies and, in some countries, mental health.\n \n\n   \n  U.S. abortion bans generally restrict interventions to a far more limited set of health risks, like a “life-threatening medical emergency” or “substantial and irreversible” harm to major organs. A small subset of lawyers and doctors argue that the law can and should be interpreted to cover patients with chronic conditions that are worsening in pregnancy. But the vaguely written bans threaten criminal penalties for performing an illegal abortion — in Texas, up to 99 years behind bars. In practice,  few hospitals grant health exceptions , ProPublica’s reporting has found.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Jessica Tarleton, an OB-GYN who provides abortions in South Carolina, recalled how much changed at her hospital when the state’s ban was put in place: OB-GYNs who want to provide an abortion to a patient with a health risk now need to get a maternal-fetal medicine specialist to explicitly write in the chart that it is necessary, in compliance with the law. Not many doctors are willing to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “Some people were not because of their personal beliefs, and some because they didn’t want to be involved in any kind of potential legal actions,” Tarleton said. “They didn’t want their opinion to have anything to do with a patient getting an abortion or not.”\n \n\n   \n  Recently, for example, Cristina Nuñez sued two hospitals in El Paso for their inaction in her care in 2023. She had diabetes, uncontrolled blood pressure and end-stage kidney disease when she learned she was unexpectedly pregnant at 36. Doctors wrote in her medical record that “she needs termination based on threat to maternal life or health,” but Nuñez alleged that one hospital failed to find an anesthesiologist willing to participate. She remained pregnant for weeks, even as blood clots turned her right arm black, until an advocacy organization threatened legal action and she was able to obtain an abortion. The lawsuit is ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  This year, Texas Republicans  passed legislation with minor  amendments to their ban after ProPublica reported the deaths of three miscarrying women who did not receive critical abortion care during emergencies. In the updated law, an emergency still needs to be “life-threatening” to qualify for an abortion, but it no longer needs to be “imminent.” Doctors expect that most hospitals still won’t provide abortions to women like Walker who have dangerous chronic conditions but no certain threat to their lives.\n \n\n   \n  ProPublica asked Sen. Bryan Hughes, the author of Texas’ abortion ban, about how the specific complications Walker faced should be treated by doctors under the amended law. When her pregnancy began, would she be eligible for an abortion due to her health? Would she need to wait for a diagnosis of severe preeclampsia? Is there a reason the law doesn’t include an exception for health risks? ProPublica put the same questions to the 20 state senators who co-wrote the bipartisan amendment.\n \n\n   \n  Only Sen. Carol Alvarado, a Democrat, responded. In her view, the amendment was far too narrow. But, she said, her Republican colleagues defer to the far right of their base and oppose broader exceptions.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t proclaim to be pro-life, but you’re passing laws that are endangering women and causing death,” she said. “We have to allow for more exceptions.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘So you’d rather let somebody die?’\n \n\n   \n  After Walker died, her family felt bewildered by her medical care. The doctors had assured them that her baby was healthy and she would be fine. The autopsy found that the fetus was indeed healthy, at just under a pound and measuring 9 inches long. But it showed that Walker had hypertensive cardiovascular disease with preeclampsia, along with an enlarged heart, dangerously full of fluid, and kidney damage — signs that her condition had declined even more than she knew.\n \n\n   \n  In Carson’s mind, the many doctors they saw cast the risks as challenges that would be overcome if his wife followed directions. “She was doing what they told her to do,” he said. He couldn’t understand how no one suggested ending the pregnancy to keep Walker safe. “Nobody said nothing.”\n \n\n   \n  Latanya worried the law played a role. “They didn’t want to offer to end the pregnancy, because the government or someone says you can’t? So you’d rather let somebody die?” she said. “Now we are the ones that have to suffer.”\n \n\n   \n  JJ couldn’t bear to stay in the home where he had found his mom, so he moved in with Latanya. Each day, he scrolls through old videos on the computer so he can hear Walker’s voice.\n \n\n   \n  Latanya does everything she can to support him, but she knows she can’t erase his pain.\n \n\n   \n  She recalls watching JJ steady himself at Walker’s funeral, to see her one last time. Until that point, he hadn’t cried.\n \n\n   \n  When he finally faced the open casket where his mom lay holding her fetus, JJ sank to his knees, overcome. His aunt, uncles, cousins and grandmother gathered around him and rocked him in their arms.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-investigation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:32:00Z","title":"Missing Child Melodee Buzzard: Mother’s Uncooperative Stance and Suspicious Road Trip Raise Red Flags","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month after being last seen with her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, during a cross-country road trip from California to Nebraska.

What may happen next? \n       \n  By Eric Levenson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:32 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard has been missing for over a month after she was last seen with her mother wearing wigs on a cross-country road trip.\n \n\n   \n  The mother, Ashlee Buzzard, returned to their California home without Melodee, did not report her daughter missing and has declined to cooperate with law enforcement, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI has joined in the search for Melodee, and the case has drawn  widespread attention  well outside of Southern California. In all, the set of circumstances has raised serious red flags about Melodee’s well-being and about potential criminal wrongdoing for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n  Still, investigators have not charged Buzzard with a crime related to Melodee’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  So, what gives?\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just not, ‘A kid’s missing. They haven’t been seen. Let’s arrest the mother,’” CNN legal analyst  Joey Jackson  said of how law enforcement operates. “What are the specific factual circumstances that would make the mother responsible?”\n \n\n   \n  “In any case, you need probable cause,” he added. “Is there reason to believe that a crime was committed and the subject of the person being arrested committed it?”\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke to several legal experts and re-examined other high-profile missing children cases to better understand the potential path forward in Melodee’s case.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office, with assistance from the FBI, has been searching for Melodee and has publicly released some information from the “critical” time period of the road trip from October 7 to 10. Still, investigators may have more evidence that has not been released to the public, making it difficult to speculate on the case.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re waiting for is evidence if she should be charged, and if so, with what,” Los Angeles’ Loyola Law School Professor  Laurie Levenson  said. “This one is still kind of a mystery. We know something is amiss: All of the wigs, the travel, the concerns that people are showing. I think those are legitimate that something is amiss, but we just don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   \n    Melodee went missing last month\n \n\n   \n  The search for Melodee Buzzard began on October 14 when a school administrator reported the girl had been absent for a prolonged period of time.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found, officials said. Her mother could not provide a “reasonable” explanation for her whereabouts and “has been uncooperative” with investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts has focused on her and her mother’s movements during a 1,000-mile road trip from their home in Lompoc, California, to Nebraska. On October 7, Ashlee Buzzard left California with Melodee, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, and returned three days later without the girl. That period is now a “critical” time frame for investigators, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from a rental car business in Lompoc showed the mother-daughter pair wearing wigs on October 7, the sheriff’s office said. Further, the rental car’s license plate was changed midway through the trip in what the sheriff’s office said is believed to be an attempt “to avoid detection.”\n \n\n   \n  “Investigators also believe that Ashlee swapped wigs throughout the trip, changing to a darker wig that is similar in color and style to the one Melodee was seen wearing,”  the sheriff’s office said in a November 6 statement . “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel.”\n \n\n   \n  On November 7, the sheriff’s office  announced  Ashlee Buzzard was arrested on a felony false imprisonment charge related to an adult male victim. Authorities alleged she used a box cutter and “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  The alleged victim in the case posted a statement on social media – which he later removed – saying he went to Buzzard’s house to offer help finding Melodee. He said Buzzard “became visibly distressed after sharing information she appeared to regret disclosing.”\n \n\n   \n  She pleaded not guilty and was released from custody with GPS monitoring. A preliminary court hearing is expected Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard’s attorney, Adrian Galvan, told CNN the defense was “eager to test” the accuser’s “credibility, veracity and reliability” in the false imprisonment incident. He declined to comment about the investigation into Melodee’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  The Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office did not respond to a request for comment on the search for Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said they had lost touch with Melodee and Ashlee Buzzard in recent years. Melodee’s father died from a motorcycle crash when the girl was only 6 months old,  CNN affiliate KSBY  reported.\n \n\n   \n    The next steps in the investigation\n \n\n   \n  Investigators are likely to continue tracing the steps of the road trip as they search for physical evidence, digital communications and witnesses, legal experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is what they should be doing,” CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller explained. “They are taking their time. They are being meticulous. They are building the pieces of a case that may come together if and when they do have evidence to arrest her.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Buzzard, her uncooperative stance may be frustrating for investigators, but the Fifth Amendment guarantees everyone the right to silence in an interrogation.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no legal imperative at all, under any circumstance, no matter how bad things might look for you in public opinion, for you to say anything,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n    Other missing children cases\n \n\n   \n  In two high-profile cases involving missing children, the parents were initially charged with lesser counts as investigators continued to search for more evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Florida mother  Casey Anthony , for one, was initially charged with child neglect, providing false statements to police and obstruction in July 2008 in the disappearance of her 2-year-old daughter  Caylee Anthony . The child had last been seen a month earlier and was reported missing by her grandparents.\n \n\n   \n  Months later, in October of that year, Anthony was indicted on a first-degree murder charge. The decomposed body of her daughter was found in December 2008.\n \n\n   \n  A jury ultimately acquitted her of murder but convicted her on four counts of providing false information to police.\n \n\n   \n  Or consider the case of the Idaho mother  Lori Vallow Daybell .\n \n\n   \n  Her children, JJ and Tylee, were last seen in September 2019, and relatives raised concerns about their whereabouts two months later. In  February 2020 , Vallow Daybell was arrested in Hawaii on suspicion of two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children.\n \n\n   \n  The children’s bodies were found in June 2020, and Vallow Daybell and her husband, Chad Daybell, were then indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Both were later  convicted  of  murder  in the children’s deaths.\n \n\n   \n  How Melodee’s case will play out remains a mystery.   In the near term, investigators’ focus will remain on finding her and her well-being.\n \n\n   \n  “There are so many open questions at this point,” Levenson said. “Right now, I think the priority is probably less the charges and more finding the kid.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/boasberg-contempt-of-court-alien-enemies-act-flights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:09:00-05:00","title":"Judge Boasberg to resume criminal contempt inquiry into Trump officials involved in Alien Enemies Act deportation flights","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, an Obama appointee, has resumed a criminal contempt inquiry into Trump administration officials who allegedly defied his court order to halt the use of the Alien Enemies Act for expediting deportations of migrants.

contempt inquiry into Trump officials involved in Alien Enemies Act deportation flights \n       \n  By Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:09 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge said Wednesday that he plans to “promptly” move ahead with an effort to find out which Trump administration officials were responsible for flouting his orders in a high-stakes immigration case – and whether they will face punishment for their actions.\n \n\n   \n  The comments from US District Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal trial-level court in Washington, DC, come nearly a week after a appeals court cleared the way for him to continue with a criminal contempt inquiry that was put on ice months ago.\n \n\n   \n  ”I am authorized to proceed just as I intended to do in April – seven months ago,” Boasberg said during a hearing Wednesday in the immigration case concerning President Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations of alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.\n \n\n   \n  “This has been sitting for a long time and I believe that justice requires me to move promptly on this,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, had ordered the administration in mid-March to turn around planes carrying migrants being deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the sweeping 18th Century wartime authority.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the flights continued, and the migrants were held at the prison for several months before being released this summer as part of a prisoner swap with Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “I certainly intend to find out what happened on that day,” Boasberg said on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n    What Boasberg wants to find out\n \n\n   \n  In a blockbuster decision issued in April, Boasberg said “probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt.” But before he could move forward with finding out who was responsible for defying his orders, the proceedings were put on hold by the DC US Circuit Court of Appeals. That court on Friday paved the way for him to restart his inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  The judge suggested that part of his inquiry could involve declarations from administration officials, or hauling officials into his courtroom to provide testimony under oath. Those hearings, he said, could begin as soon as December 1.\n \n\n   \n  Among those he’s interested in hearing from is an ex-Justice Department lawyer who alleged in a whistleblower complaint earlier this year that a then-top DOJ official told his colleagues in March that the administration  intended to ignore court orders  as part of the government’s aggressive deportation effort.\n \n\n   \n  That complaint, Boasberg said, was just one part of the “significant developments” that have occurred while his contempt proceedings were on hold for much of this year.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg’s decisions this year in the case  drew the ire of Trump , who earlier this year called for the judge’s impeachment, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. The chief said the proper ways to respond to a disagreeable court ruling is to appeal it.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham and several other Republican senators are calling for Boasberg to be suspended and impeached after learning that the judge refused to allow the phone carrier Verizon to notify them that their phone records had been subpoenaed in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg has asked the Justice Department and attorneys behind the Alien Enemies Act legal challenge to provide their view on how he should proceed with the contempt inquiry by Monday.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/uk/russia-spy-ship-yantar-lasers-britain-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"14:50:00Z","title":"Russian spy ship enters UK waters and aims lasers at military pilots, Britain says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Russian spy ship, the Yantar, has entered British waters and been reported to have directed lasers at Royal Air Force (RAF) Poseidon-8 military pilots.

enters UK waters and aims lasers at military pilots, Britain says \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, Catherine Nicholls, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:50 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Russian spy ship has entered British waters and directed lasers at military pilots, Britain’s defense secretary said Wednesday, as he warned that the country was facing a “new era of threat” from hostile actors.\n \n\n   \n  During a speech in London, John Healey said the Yantar spy ship was currently on the edge of British waters, north of Scotland, and that the ship was designed for “gathering intelligence and mapping Britain’s undersea cables.”\n \n\n   \n  He said a Royal Air Force (RAF) Poseidon-8 military plane had been deployed to “track this vessel’s every move” and that its pilots said they were targeted by lasers.\n \n\n   \n  “That Russian action is deeply dangerous,” Healey said. “My message to Russia and to (President Vladimir) Putin is this: ‘We see you, we know what you’re doing, and if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready.’”\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s embassy in London responded angrily to what it called “the latest provocative statements” from Healey and claimed that the Yantar was an   “oceanographic research vessel” operating in international waters. In a statement, the embassy denied targeting Britain’s underwater communications or undermining its security.\n \n\n   \n  “London’s Russophobic course and the whipping up of militaristic hysteria are contributing to the further degradation of European security, creating the conditions for new dangerous situations,” the embassy said.\n \n\n   \n  The Yantar has entered Britain’s exclusive economic zone, which extends up to 200 nautical miles (about 230 miles) offshore, but the ship has stayed on the edge of the country’s territorial waters, defined as stretching 12 nautical miles (13.8 miles) from the coast, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Healey said Russia’s actions would not deter Britain from supporting Ukraine and that the government would continue to be vigilant – “just as we have been about incursions into NATO airspace, just as we are being now in terms of identifying the Russian spy ship in UK waters and just as we have continued to be in response to sabotage threats that we have seen across many different European countries as well.”\n \n\n   \n  Healey’s extraordinary announcement marked the second time this year that Britain has called out the activities of the Yantar. The government says the ship maps the undersea cables used by Britain and its NATO allies for energy and communications and is part of Russia’s secretive deep-sea research unit known as GUGI. But Healey said this is the first time that Russia has directly aimed lasers at British military aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  “We take it extremely seriously,” he said.   “I’ve changed the navy’s rules of engagement so that we can follow more closely, monitor more closely, the activities of the Yantar when it’s in our wider waters.” The defense secretary stressed that Britain has “military options ready, should the Yantar change course.”\n \n\n   \n  Britain sees Yantar’s latest incursion into waters of the UK’s economic zone as part of a pattern of increasingly reckless Russian  forays  into NATO territory, as Moscow seeks to show Europe that there are costs for backing Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  In recent months,  drones  have repeatedly crossed from Russia into NATO’s airspace, alongside other acts of  sabotage . This week, Polish officials blamed Russia for an explosion on a key  rail track  from Poland to Ukraine, calling it an “unprecedented act of sabotage.” Overnight into Wednesday, NATO once again  scrambled fighter jets  over Poland and Romania after Russian airstrikes struck western Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a new era of threat,” Healey said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/entertainment/family-stone-sequel-thomas-bezucha-diane-keaton","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"14:21:00-05:00","title":"A 'Family Stone' sequel is in the works, says writer-director Thomas Bezucha","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sequel to the 2005 holiday classic 'The Family Stone' is being developed by writer-director Thomas Bezucha, who has been deeply affected by the death of original actress Diane Keaton, who played the matriarch Sybil Stone.

\nUpdated: \n        2:16 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Blake Butera checked his phone after the birth of his first baby, he had about 600 text messages congratulating him on his new job: fatherhood.\n \n\n   \n  Well, not  just  fatherhood.\n \n\n   \n  The 33-year-old new dad to a daughter was also named the  Washington Nationals ’ new manager, making him the youngest major league manager in over 50 years. That news had broken about two hours before Blair Margaux Butera was born.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t respond until we got out of the hospital a couple days later and, with that, it was funny because almost half the messages were like ‘Congrats on the job!’ and then another text message a day later that was like, ‘Oh wait, and you guys had a baby!’” Butera told  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  Actually, to be precise, both baby and job were finalized on the same day.\n \n\n   \n  Before he even agreed to interview for one of the most exclusive jobs in the world, Butera needed to ask his wife: “Is this something we can do right now?”\n \n\n   \n  Butera, the then Tampa Bay Rays’ senior director of player development, had wanted to be a major league manager someday, but he was happy in his role, happy with his organization and about to have his first baby.\n \n\n   \n  His wife, Caroline Margolis, was adamant.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s like, ‘We’ll figure it out, we always do,’” Butera said. “She’s like, ‘This is how the baseball world is. It’s hard to prepare and plan for everything to go exactly how you want it to, or how you expect it to.’”\n \n\n   \n  “I just know it’s something he’s always thought about and dreamt about,” Margolis told CNN Sports. “He was really missing being back on the field.”\n \n\n   \n  In baseball, teams have to grant permission for one of their employees to interview elsewhere. This meant that the Nats’ new general manager, Paul Toboni, needed to speak with the Rays president of baseball operations, Erik Neander, before reaching out to Butera. Neander had told Toboni that Butera was expecting a baby imminently.\n \n\n   \n  “So when Paul reached out, he said, ‘I’m fully aware of what’s going on. I have four kids myself. Before we start this process, I want you to know that your wife and your soon-to-be baby are first and foremost. And if we ever have to cut off communication, I completely understand. I don’t want you to miss the birth of your first child. You need to be there for that, you need to be there for Caroline,’” Butera said.\n \n\n   \n  That, and Toboni’s willingness to come to Raleigh, where Butera and Margolis live, for the interview rather than requiring him to travel in the weeks near the end of her pregnancy, reassured them about the organization’s priorities. They moved forward with the process.\n \n\n   \n  October 26 was the baby’s due date. The next day, a Monday, the Nationals offered Butera the job, kicking off the contract negotiations. On October 29, Butera and Margolis went to the hospital. They discussed the contract and watched the  World Series  game on TV that night.\n \n\n   \n  In the morning, October 30, Toboni called Butera to tell him that ESPN’s Jeff Passan was about to break the news. Soon, everyone would know that he was the next Nats manager. His new boss advised Butera to turn off his phone and focus on his family.\n \n\n   \n  But the TV was still on in the delivery room. The news of Butera’s hiring aired just as his wife was about to deliver their baby.\n \n\n   \n  “You couldn’t even make it up,” he said. “It just feels like a story that’s not real.”\n \n\n   \n  Later, after they’d moved to the recovery room, Butera signed his contract making the hiring official.\n \n\n   \n  “Once we had settled our breath a little bit, I was like, ‘All right, we’re doing this? You’re ready for me to sign the contract?’” Butera said. “Signed the contract together and said, ‘All right, well, we’re now a new family, and we also have kind of a new chapter in our lives.’”\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent that I remember it, that is how I remember it,” Margolis laughed. “I just remember her being in my arms.”\n \n\n   \n  The Nats waited two weeks to introduce their new manager so the equally new parents could have some time to settle in. The news conference was a full family affair. Baby Blair came, along with Margolis and her parents, and the Nats welcomed them with a custom jersey small enough to fit a two-week-old.\n \n\n   \n  That wasn’t even her first merch. The team had a care package waiting at the couple’s home when they got back from the hospital – three gift bags all full of Washington Nationals baby clothes.\n \n\n   \n  “It was strictly for Blair. Like, the only one we care about here is Blair,” Butera said. “I think we’re learning pretty early that Blair is the focus here.”\n \n\n   \n  Blair and Toboni’s four boys were highlighted in  a social media post  by the team as well.\n \n\n   \n  “Sports, and  baseball  in particular, you’re gone so much of the year. I think it’s really hard on families sometimes,” Butera told CNN Sports. “It’s just important to us that we still spend time together as a family in an industry where it’s really hard to. I think just being able to see that on social media and on TV, like for others to see, it means a lot to us.”\n \n\n   \n  For Margolis, this whirlwind has been just what she expected out of a life in baseball.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s what you sign up for. They’re gone a lot, and if you’re not supporting the passion and the dream, then it’s just not going to work,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  And this particular complication was one they were excited to have. Margolis is just beginning to think about what it will mean for Blair to grow up around a major league clubhouse.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope that she will appreciate how special it is and just how cool,” Margolis said. “Her dad’s job is very cool.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/europe/turkey-suspected-poisoning-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"Turkish police investigating after family on holiday dies in suspected poisoning","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A family of four from Hamburg, Germany, died in Istanbul after falling ill following a day of sightseeing and eating street food.

marquee event in men’s soccer.\n \n\n   \n  Curaçao, an autonomous territory of about 156,000 people within the Netherlands kingdom, takes the record of Iceland, with a population of just over 350,000, which was the previous smallest country to reach the World Cup when it qualified for Russia 2018.\n \n\n   \n  A team relying heavily on players born and raised in the Netherlands rode its luck Tuesday to take a 0-0 draw in Jamaica and finish top of a four-team group. Its other opponents were Trinidad and Tobago and last-place Bermuda.\n \n\n   \n  Curaçao has actively recruited from its diaspora, getting permission from FIFA within world soccer’s rules to change the national-team eligibility of players who once represented the Netherlands at youth or Under-21 level, including five since August.\n \n\n   \n  Defender Joshua Brenet even played a World Cup qualifying game for the Netherlands in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  Tahith Chong, a former Manchester United youth player, is one of the few squad members born in Curaçao, which was called Netherlands Antilles until getting its autonomy 15 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  A storied Dutch coach has led Curaçao on to the elite stage for the first expanded 48-team World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n \n\n   \n  Dick Advocaat, at age 78, is set to lead his third team at a World Cup, and his second in the U.S. He took his native Netherlands to the quarterfinals at the 1994 edition and coached South Korea at the 2006 World Cup in Germany.\n \n\n   \n  Curaçao’s adventure is set to put players from unheralded clubs on the biggest stage. The squad that clinched qualification included players from Rotherham in England’s third-tier league, Bandırmaspor in the Turkish second division and Abha in Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  Curaçao got the historic result despite not having Advocaat on the bench.

12:52 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York City  Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani  announced Wednesday that Jessica Tisch accepted his offer to stay at the helm of the nation’s largest police force.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement secures Mamdani’s highest-profile appointment as  he prepares to take office in January .\n \n\n   \n  It will require significant compromise from both Tisch and Mamdani, who have expressed different views on policing and public safety. Mamdani, who has been previously critical of the police and  once supported defunding the department , apologized to officers during his successful mayoral run. Tisch, known as a technocrat, has pushed to roll back criminal justice reforms and expand quality-of-life policing.\n \n\n   \n  “Leading this department is the greatest privilege of my life, and I am proud to continue doing it,” Tisch wrote in a letter to the NYPD that was obtained by CNN. “Now, do the Mayor-elect and I agree on everything? No, we don’t. But in speaking with him, it’s clear that we share broad and crucial priorities: the importance of public safety, the need to continue driving down crime, and the need to maintain stability and order across the department. We also agree that you deserve the city’s respect and support.”\n \n\n   \n  For weeks, it remained unclear whether Tisch, who was appointed to the department by Mayor Eric Adams, would accept to stay in the role after Mamdani publicly committed to keeping her on the job during the last mayoral debate.\n \n\n   \n  It was a final-hour effort by  Mamdani and his campaign  to show how much he was willing to compromise and appeal to city voters who remained skeptical about his campaign, particularly among older and more moderate Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Tisch abstained from commenting on the race for mayor or Mamdani’s politics during the campaign. Last week, Mamdani and Tisch held a meeting, but it remained unclear if he had secured a commitment.  Gov. Kathy Hochul , one of the chief supporters of retaining Tisch, said she was confident Tisch would stay.\n \n\n   \n  Tisch, heiress to the Loews family fortune, is a career public servant who previously served as commissioner for the sanitation department and the city’s chief technology officer. She is highly regarded in government circles and was appointed to the job following a string of high-profile corruption scandals that rocked the department under Adams’ administration.\n \n\n   \n  In the last year, Tisch has overseen a record drop in the city’s crime rate, a reduction in shootings and homicides, and an effort to remove thousands of illegal guns from city streets.\n \n\n   \n    Joint appearance\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Tisch appeared together Wednesday at the Fallen Heroes Memorial in Lower Manhattan. The pair walked around the site while Tisch pointed out the names of officers recently killed in the line of duty. They were joined by a small group of officers who shook hands with Mamdani as he asked about their time in the department.\n \n\n   \n  “I appreciate the moments I just shared with Commissioner Tisch and a number of officers here with us to pay our respects to NYPD officers who lost their lives in the line of duty and to learn a little bit more about the names that some many New Yorkers have come to know, the heroism and the families they left behind,” Mamdani told reporters after the visit.\n \n\n   \n  Tisch declined to answer questions and told reporters she wanted to keep “politics out” of the discussion.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m sure there will be plenty of time to discuss all of that,” Tisch said, praising Mamdani for choosing the police memorial as the site of their first public appearance. “To me it is very meaningful that he asked to come here as our first public venture to visit the memorial.”\n \n\n   \n  As part of his campaign, Mamdani proposed creating a “Department of Community Safety,” which would shift focus away from the NYPD for certain emergency calls like responding to people in mental distress, domestic violence calls or the homeless. Mamdani has said the calls would still rely on police when necessary, but he has described the effort as a move that would allow police to focus on fighting serious crime.\n \n\n   \n  Following his visit, Mamdani suggested Tisch was on board with his proposal.\n \n\n   \n   “It’s untenable for officers to be asked to respond to respond to the 200,000 mental health calls they receive every year, to be tasked with the responsibility to deal with the mental health crisis, the homelessness crisis,” Mamdani said. “The commissioner and I share a belief in the fact that in order for police officers to be able to do their jobs we also need to create a Department of Community Safety to be tasked with those responsibilities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/uriostegui-rios-deportation-government-lawsuit-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"13:10:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration ‘inadvertently’ deported transgender woman to Mexico despite judge’s concern she may face torture there","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration admitted it 'inadvertently' deported a transgender woman, Britania Uriostegui Rios, to Mexico in November 2025, despite a federal judge's order that she would face torture or violent persecution if returned there.

   \nUpdated: \n        1:10 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration admitted it “inadvertently” deported a transgender woman to Mexico this month after a judge ordered she not be removed to the country over fears she may be tortured or violently persecuted.\n \n\n   \n  The government has said it will allow Britania Uriostegui Rios, a Mexican national,   to return to the US if she is able to make it to the border. Once she has returned, she will be placed back in ICE custody while the administration tries to deport her to a different country,   court documents show.\n \n\n   \n  The case marks the latest example of the Trump administration wrongfully removing someone protected by court orders or special status as it works to carry out the president’s goal of a  history-making  mass deportation program. Uriostegui Rios is  at least the fifth  such case this year, including the administration’s  dramatic legal showdown  over the removal – and  eventual return  – of Salvadoran man Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n \n\n   \n  Uriostegui Rios’s attorneys are suing the administration and demanding that she not be required to return to federal custody once she is back in the US – “if she happens to make it to a port of entry without dying.”\n \n\n   \n  Mexico is one of the deadliest countries in the world for transgender people, according to the  Trans Murder Monitoring Project . Though the full scope of risk to transgender people in Mexico is unclear, journalists and advocacy groups  have documented  pervasive – and  often fatal  – violence.\n \n\n   \n  Since entering the US in 2003, Uriostegui Rios has racked up a lengthy criminal history that includes convictions for disorderly conduct, sexual solicitation and DUI, according to  court filings  from a Department of Homeland Security official.\n \n\n   \n  An immigration judge  ordered her deportation  in March after she was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in Las Vegas.\n \n\n   \n  But the judge simultaneously blocked the government from removing Uriostegui Rios to her native Mexico, finding there was a likelihood she could face “torture” there.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Uriostegui Rios was flown from a detention center in Louisiana to Texas on November 11, where her attorneys say she was taken across the border to Mexico without money, her daily medications or a cell phone. She was able to borrow a phone and call her attorneys, who say they were not notified Uriostegui Rios had been deported.\n \n\n   \n  “ICE confirmed that your client was removed to Mexico inadvertently,” Department of Justice attorney Shannon Smitherman  wrote in an email  filed in court. The next day, she wrote, “ICE stands ready to remedy the inadvertent removal by allowing your client to voluntarily reenter the United States if your client wishes to do so.”\n \n\n   \n  DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN that Uriostegui Rios was “removed from the US and will be brought back to the US.” At the same time, the agency will seek another country for deportation.\n \n\n   \n  “The end result will be the same - Rios will not be able to remain in the US and will be removed,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has not responded to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Uriostegui Rios was being detained in a men’s facility in Louisiana while the US government unsuccessfully tried to deport her to Costa Rica, Honduras and Nicaragua, according to court filings. In August, it began an effort to remove her to El Salvador, but the petition is still pending with Salvadoran officials.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear what fears Uriostegui Rios expressed to the judge, but the  legal definition of torture  is vast and includes state-sanctioned violence, “cruel and inhumane treatment,” and prolonged mental suffering out of fear for one’s life.\n \n\n   \n  When asked what threats Uriostegui Rios faces in Mexico, her attorney Bridget Pranzatelli told CNN she “is a trans woman who has been through extreme trauma, including being sexually trafficked by cartels [at] as young as 12 years old.”\n \n\n   \n  “As a result of these experiences, she has significant mental health issues,” Pranzatelli said. “There are many actors in Mexico who want to hurt her, which is why an immigration judge found it more likely than not that she would be tortured or killed if forced to return.”\n \n\n   \n   ﻿ Since being sent to Mexico, Uriostegui Rios has been shielding her identity while sheltering with family out of fear they will discover she is trans and kick her out, one of her attorneys, Talia Lepson, wrote in  a court filing .\n \n\n   \n  If Uriostegui Rios is able to return to the US, her legal team is asking that she be released from ICE custody and be allowed to go home under a supervision order, saying “the government cannot be trusted to follow the law” or court orders.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/democratic-lawmakers-urge-troops-to-disobey-illegal-orders","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"14:05:00Z","title":"Democratic Lawmakers Urge Troops to Disobey Illegal Orders","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democratic lawmakers, including veteran Senators and Representatives such as Elissa Slotkin, Mark Kelly, and Reps.

previously served in the military or intelligence community are urging service members and intelligence officials to disobey illegal orders that might be issued by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  In a video  posted on X  Tuesday, Democratic lawmakers Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Sen. Mark Kelly, Rep. Jason Crow, Rep. Maggie Goodlander, Rep. Chris Deluzio and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan said the “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”\n \n\n   \n  “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law, or our Constitution,” they said. “Know that we have your back… don’t give up the ship.”\n \n\n   \n  In the video, the lawmakers don’t specify which orders service members have received, or might receive, that could be illegal.\n \n\n   \n  Service members are required to follow only lawful orders in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Following an order that might violate the law could open service members up to prosecution, as legal precedent holds that receiving an order alone isn’t a defense, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense” as it was deployed by senior members of Adolph Hitler’s leadership team during legal proceedings after World War II.\n \n\n   \n  The video comes as US military officials, including the  commander of US Southern Command , and US allies,  including the UK , have questioned the legality of a series of military strikes targeting suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The attacks have killed at least 83 people since September.  The Trump administration is also fighting multiple  court cases  over its use of troops in American cities, raising legal questions about how the military can be used on US soil.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers quickly pushed back on the video. Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn told Fox on Wednesday, “It is inconceivable that you would have elected officials that are saying to uniformed members of the military who have taken an oath that they would defy the orders that they have been given to execute their mission.”\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox on Tuesday that “the senators and congressmen who made a video suggesting our men and women in the military do not have to follow unlawful orders have yet to show us an example. They owe it to our men and women in the military to be specific about orders issued by President Trump or those under his command that they believe to be unlawful.”\n \n\n   \n  The Defense Department is relying on a Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion to legally justify the US military’s strikes against boats allegedly carrying drugs. The OLC opinion includes a list of 24 different cartels and criminal organizations based around Latin America it says the administration is authorized to target, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  But lawmakers who have been briefed by the Pentagon about the operation have said that military officials have  acknowledged  not knowing the individual identities of those they are targeting before killing them. Instead, the officials said they need only establish that those on board the vessels are affiliated with cartels. Lawyers inside the Pentagon have raised legal concerns about the US military strikes, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings on the operation, lawmakers have said. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth fired the top uniformed lawyers for the Army and Air Force earlier this year,  telling reporters afterwards  that he viewed them as potential “roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief.”\n \n\n   \n  To date, key lawmakers have also not received a single briefing from members of the intelligence community on its role in the boat strikes  —despite submitting multiple requests for information and the Trump administration publicly citing intelligence that those killed were known drug traffickers, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Formal requests, including at least one sent to Trump’s Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, have gone unanswered, the source added, noting lawmakers have received briefings only from officials at the State Department and Department of Defense so far.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/what-we-know-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:18:00Z","title":"Congress Votes to Release Epstein Files: What We Know About the Records","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress has voted to release the Epstein files, which include over 300 gigabytes of documents, emails, photographs, and audio from the FBI’s investigations into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Here’s what we know about them \n       \n  By Haven Orecchio-Egresitz, Kara Scannell, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:18 PM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Congress has voted to  force the release of records  amassed by federal prosecutors during the sex trafficking investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice  Ghislaine Maxwell .\n \n\n   \n  The question of what is actually in those pages — and whether the public will ever see all of those documents — has become a headache for President Donald Trump and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  On November 12, the House Oversight Committee released  20,000 more pages  of records it received from Epstein’s estate, including emails in which Epstein insulted Trump and appeared to coordinate his response with Maxwell to a lawsuit brought by accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, though — six years after Epstein died in his New York prison cell — the public has gotten its hands on many records related to the disgraced financier and his alleged child sex trafficking ring.\n \n\n   \n  Some documents have come from the criminal trial and case file of Maxwell, Epstein’s onetime girlfriend. Others   came from Epstein’s estate, which provided the records to the House Oversight Committee in response to a subpoena.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what new information, if any, is stuffed in the boxes of evidence within the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Some of it, such as records that detail the physical and sexual abuse of women and girls, may never be released.\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein files are made of over 300 gigabytes of data, paper, video, photographs, and audio that live within the FBI’s main electronic case management system, “Sentinel.” These records would include investigative reports and records from the FBI Miami field division’s original Epstein investigation. The bulk of the records would come from the second investigation carried out by the FBI’s New York Office, including memorandums about the investigation and potential targets, locations to be searched, records to be subpoenaed, and hundreds of pages of “302s,” which are the forms that FBI agents use to memorialize what witnesses, victims and suspects said in interviews with investigators.\n \n\n   \n  The case has continued to fascinate the public, years after Epstein’s death, due to his ties to powerful people. Politicians, including Trump, and celebrities have been publicly linked to Epstein for years — sometimes by appearing in flight logs or at events — and all have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death by suicide before trial launched conspiracy theories and deprived many of his accusers a public airing of his conduct. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking minors following a four-week trial in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, after the most recent release of estate records announced he was asking Attorney General Pam Bondi  to investigate Epstein’s ties  to many other high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman — as well as the bank JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later announced on X that  Jay Clayton , the US attorney in Manhattan, will lead the federal investigation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether opening a new criminal investigation would prevent the release of the highly anticipated Justice Department records.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we do and don’t know about the Epstein records:\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department had asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal cases. Former federal prosecutors say the transcripts likely contain a miniscule amount of evidence from the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York generally call law enforcement agents to testify before the grand jury to present just enough evidence they need to support an indictment. Other witnesses, including accusers, are rarely called in to testify before federal grand juries in New York.\n \n\n   \n  The judges overseeing the two cases in New York asked DOJ for more legal argument for why they should unseal grand jury material, which is rarely done. In August, two federal judges in New York  declined Justice Department requests  to unseal grand jury information in Epstein and Maxwell’s cases.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Florida also denied DOJ’s request to unseal grand jury transcripts from its 2005 and 2007 investigations into Epstein, stating the department didn’t meet the legal hurdle to do so under the rules governing the circuit.\n \n\n   \n    Search warrants\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors and the FBI obtained a trove of information during the searches of Epstein’s homes in Florida, New York and Little Saint James, Epstein’s private Caribbean island. That information is under the control of DOJ and is not blocked from public release by secrecy rules.\n \n\n   \n  FBI officials recovered thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females, including at least of one minor, in a search of his Manhattan mansion in the days following his arrest. Binders of CDs containing the photos were seized. Agents used a saw to open a safe that had more than $70,000 in cash, 48 loose diamond stones, one as large as 2.38 carats, and a large diamond ring.\n \n\n   \n  They also collected documents from the New York home, including notes, messages with names and contact information for certain victims, and phone records.\n \n\n   \n  A search of Epstein’s private island was conducted days after he was found dead in a jail cell about one month after his arrest. By then the investigation had shifted its focus to any co-conspirators of Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  In February, the Justice Department provided an  index  of evidence it has. The index includes over two dozen computers, numerous hard drives, at least two cell phones, and four iPads. The index says there are boat trip logs potentially of who traveled to his private island — that information has not been made public.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department does not release child pornography so those records would not be expected to be made public under any circumstance.\n \n\n   \n    Florida DOJ case file\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York obtained the investigative record from the earlier investigations into Epstein conducted by their counterparts in Florida in 2007 and 2009. Any of those records that were not covered by grand jury secrecy rules could be released.\n \n\n   \n    Civil lawsuits\n \n\n   \n  Much of the public record relating to Epstein has derived from civil lawsuits brought by accusers, some filed under their own names and others using Jane Doe pseudonyms. Judges have  ordered  the release of thousands of pages of documents, including depositions taken under oath.\n \n\n   \n  Among the famous names referenced in those  documents  are Trump, Clinton, Britain’s Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, French modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, American investor Glenn Dubin, and Leslie Wexner, the CEO of L Brands. Not all of them were accused of wrongdoing, and all of them have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Two financial institutions, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase — where Epstein held bank accounts — also reached settlements with survivors and others.\n \n\n   \n  Records from a lawsuit brought by the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned Little Saint James, against JPMorgan Chase revealed details about Epstein’s  financial transactions  with Wall Street titans and his practice of withdrawing large amounts of cash. JPMorgan filed numerous suspicious activity reports with the Treasury Department flagging those transactions.\n \n\n   \n    Maxwell trial\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s four-week criminal trial was a public airing of her close relationship to Epstein and her role recruiting, grooming and at times participating in the sexual abuse of minors with Epstein. Four women testified about being sexually assaulted when they were minors.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s former pilot  testified  and identified people he saw on Epstein’s plane, including Trump, former Sens. John Glenn and George Mitchell,   Andrew, actor Kevin Spacey, and violinist Itzhak Perlman. The pilot said he never saw any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Gawker first published a copy in 2015 of Epstein’s so-called black book with names and phone numbers of his contacts. The Justice Department released a redacted version of it earlier this year as well as copies of the flight logs that were made public during Maxwell’s criminal trial.\n \n\n   \n  The release was criticized by some of Trump’s supporters because the information was already public — and did nothing to answer lingering questions.\n \n\n   \n    The estate\n \n\n   \n  In November, the House Oversight Committee released about 20,000 pages of documents it received from Epstein’s estate through a subpoena — materials the Department of Justice said it didn’t previously have access to.\n \n\n   \n  The documents included emails sent by Epstein. In one dated April 2, 2011, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. REDACTED spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” GOP members of the House Oversight Committee  identified  the person as Giuffre. In one January 2019 email, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff: “trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” The emails also showed an apparent effort between Epstein and Maxwell to coordinate how they would respond to a lawsuit from Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The recent release   was the second time that the House Oversight Committee released documents from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee put out a tranche of records, including a reported collection of birthday letters gifted to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The panel has been investigating the case and  had subpoenaed  the estate for documents as part of its probe.\n \n\n   \n  In a  social media exchange  last week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that law enforcement did not have access to the estate documents at the time of his interview with Maxwell this summer.\n \n\n   \n   A version of this story originally published in July 2025.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/family-members-raise-the-alarm-about-plight-of-american-suffering-from-cancer-jailed-in-iran","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:18:00.000-05:00","title":"Iran Imprisons Iranian-American Man for Visiting Israel 13 Years Ago","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kamran Hekmati, an Iranian-American Jewish man and U.S. citizen, was arrested in Iran in 2025 for visiting Israel 13 years ago to attend his son’s bar mitzvah.

While those cuts have been lifted, the busy holiday season could spell more disruptions, particularly if bad weather complicates operations.\n \n\n   \n  Keep in mind that in the United States, when an airline cancels your flight, you are entitled to a refund if you choose not to travel.\n \n\n   \n  “If a flight does get canceled, travelers are owed a full refund for the ticket, full stop. If they are presented with a credit, they have the right to refuse and ask for monetary refund,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for travel site Going.com, who was underlining  Department of Transportation rules .\n \n\n   \n  If a big storm or another complication seems poised to disrupt your flights, “look to make alternative travel plans immediately,” said Eric Napoli, chief legal officer at  AirHelp , an air passenger rights company. Competition for seats becomes fierce during the holiday season when flights are more full.\n \n\n   \n  “Travelers should consider looking at flights that are very early in the morning — as these are typically less delayed, too,” Napoli said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s more on what experts say you should do if your flight is delayed or canceled.\n \n\n   \n    It starts long before you go to the airport\n \n\n   \n  As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it’s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room.\n \n\n   \n  “Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,” said Scott Keyes, the founder of  Going.com . “Save yourself the drive to the airport.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s important that passengers closely monitor the routes they’re planning to travel, Napoli said.\n \n\n   \n  “We recommend booking refundable tickets or purchasing travel insurance in case of any issues that come up,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other tips from Keyes and Going.com:\n \n\n   \n    If you’re at the airport already\n \n\n   \n  If you’re at the airport, act with urgency. Quickly head to the airline agents’ desk. “It’s going to make a difference who arrives first. It’s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,” Keyes said.\n \n\n   \n  You should also call up your carrier while you’re waiting, Keyes suggested. It might be faster to get through to a call center.\n \n\n   \n  Other tactics you can try:\n \n\n   \n    Attitude and research matter\n \n\n   \n  How you approach things can make a big difference, whether on the phone or in person.\n \n\n   \n  “Honey attracts more flies than vinegar,” Keyes said. “Look at this from the airline agents’ perspective. … The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.”\n \n\n   \n  And when it’s your turn to talk to an agent about new arrangements: “Come prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.”\n \n\n   \n  Other considerations:\n \n\n   \n    Help from other airlines\n \n\n   \n  Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor.\n \n\n   \n  “When flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier’s flight because they have interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel.\n \n\n   \n  “This means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.”\n \n\n   \n    Frequent flyer miles\n \n\n   \n  Thanks to changes in frequent flyer programs over the past several years, airlines often still have flights available with miles even when demand is high during a weather event, Julian Kheel, founder and CEO of  Points Path , told CNN Travel.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ll need to be prepared to spend a lot of miles, and you may not get the best value for them,” Kheel said, but the cash savings could be significant.\n \n\n   \n  “Most US airlines now allow you to cancel flights booked with frequent flyer miles without any fee or penalty right up until departure time. That means you can book multiple alternate flights on different airlines using your miles in case one of them ends up delayed or canceled.\n \n\n   \n  “But don’t try to book alternate flights on the same airline, as duplicates can be automatically canceled. And don’t forget to cancel the remaining flights you don’t end up using so you can get your miles back.”\n \n\n   \n    Trapped for the night\n \n\n   \n  What do you do if you’re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you’re not in your home city?\n \n\n   \n  This depends on the specifics of your situation — in the US, for example, airlines aren’t legally required to put you up in a hotel. US-based airlines have their own individual policies for situations “within the airline’s control” that are tracked by the Department of Transportation,  here .\n \n\n   \n  According to the DOT, “a controllable flight cancellation or delay is essentially a delay or cancellation caused by the airline. Examples include: maintenance or crew problems; cabin cleaning; baggage loading; and fueling.” So weather events — or government shutdowns — typically would not fall into this category.\n \n\n   \n  But requirements in other countries are different. In the United Kingdom, for example, you’ll likely be automatically entitled to  food and drink vouchers and accommodation . You can read  all the details  at the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)’s website.\n \n\n   \n  Your canceled flight will be  covered by UK law  if it was supposed to be departing from the UK, no matter who you were flying with.\n \n\n   \n  And if your flight was supposed to be arriving in the UK, you’ll be covered by UK law as long as you were traveling on an EU or UK airline.  This document  from the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority explains all the ins and outs of these rules.\n \n\n   \n  Despite this, sometimes airlines can’t help everyone, and as the CAA says, “this can happen when staff are stretched during major disruptions.” The  CAA advice  is to organize “reasonable care and assistance yourself, then claim the cost back later. If you end up paying for things yourself, keep every receipt and do not spend more than is reasonable.”\n \n\n   \n  Other things to consider:\n \n\n   \n    Refunds in the US\n \n\n   \n  Airlines in the United States are now required to give passengers cash refunds if the airline cancels or significantly delays or changes a flight and the passenger chooses not to travel. See more from the  Department of Transportation here .\n \n\n   \n    Travel insurance and receipts\n \n\n   \n  Travel insurance can be helpful to ensure reimbursement in a wide variety of circumstances. However, it doesn’t help in every situation.\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Nastro suggests checking on any protections offered by your credit card before purchasing additional coverage.\n \n\n   \n  Be sure to save all of your receipts in case you need to file a claim with your insurer or your airline.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Marnie Hunter contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/netherlands-cedes-control-nexperia-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"11:19:00-05:00","title":"Netherlands Takes a Big Step to Defuse Dispute with China That Threatened Car Production","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Netherlands has suspended a controversial order to take control of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia, resolving a high-stakes standoff with China that threatened global auto production.

dismantling of Kentucky highlights the philosophical divide in college basketball \n       \n  Analysis by Dana O’Neil, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:40 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One team walked into Madison Square Garden in its team-issued sweatsuits. The other approached the Champions Classic much like an NBA squad arriving for work, fashioned in their outfits of the day. Otega Oweh sported a designer jacket from Amiri that runs about $1,200.\n \n\n   \n  Which maybe makes sense. Kentucky’s roster checks in at a reported $22 million. Might as well dress the part.\n \n\n   \n  But as college athletics continues its reckoning with big money and  bigger problems , it is perhaps worth remembering the wise words of the Beatles, penned some 60 years ago.  Can’t buy me love. \n \n\n   \n  Or, in Kentucky’s case, it can’t buy defense, offense, wins, continuity, effort and at least for the time being, success.\n \n\n   \n  The Wildcats got pantsed by Michigan State, 83-66. They trailed by as many as 24, and never led past the 14-minute mark of the first half.\n \n\n   \n  The Spartans came into the game shooting 21.7 percent from beyond the arc, and had hit a grand total of 13 treys in their first three games. Upon meeting the matadors from Kentucky, they drained 11 of 21 from long range.\n \n\n   \n  On the flip side, the Wildcats hit just six from deep, and missed 22. Kentucky also got manhandled on the boards (42 to 28) and dished 13 assists, which is the exact same number that Michigan State guard Jeremy Fears, Jr. handed out on his own.\n \n\n   \n  Built on promise and promissory notes, the Wildcats are now 3-2, the three wins coming against teams ranked between 258 and 317 in Ken Pomeroy’s rankings.\n \n\n   \n  After spending 45 minutes in the locker room with his team, Mark Pope emerged for his post-game press conference looking despondent. He waffled between just below-the-surface seething and out-and-out baffled, taking the heat while simultaneously questioning his team’s identity, promising he’d fix whatever ails his squad but also admitting what needed to be fixed would require a ‘long answer.’\n \n\n   \n  At one point, he used the words disappointed, discouraged and discombobulated in one sentence to describe his team. Fabulously alliterative, but not terribly encouraging, if you’re part of the Big Blue Nation.\n \n\n   \n  That this disastrous showing comes exactly one-week after Kentucky got beat up by rival Louisville does not help.\n \n\n   \n  After that equally disappointing, discouraging and discombobulated showing Pope alluded to a mysterious pre-game locker room issue. The way he said it - “I’m not ready to tell the story yet, but at some point, we’ll talk in detail about our pregame experience at Louisville, and it was out of character for us, and that’s young and new,’’ - it did not sound like this was some rival hijinks.\n \n\n   \n  By not specifically identifying the issue - joking later he wanted to plant some Taylor Swift Easter eggs - he opened the door to frantic speculation among a fan base that does not need to be led into the deep end of paranoia where its basketball team is concerned. It happily gets there on its own.\n \n\n   \n  At least now the issue seems clearer. Bad good news, if you will. It would be insulting to say the Wildcats don’t care. Athletes care. But perhaps this crew is currently misguided in what exactly it ought to care about.\n \n\n   \n  Flanked by Oweh and Malachi Moreno, who both looked like someone stole their lunch money (or maybe their NIL money?), Pope was asked how player injuries (point guard Jaland Lowe didn’t play) might be affecting his team’s performance. A Mormon who doesn’t really curse, Pope started, “I’m going to temper my words.’’\n \n\n   \n  He then took a deep long breath. “If you build an organization, your identity isn’t about an individual person; it’s about a collective group.”\n \n\n   \n  It is perhaps unfair to take one team’s misery a handful of weeks into a season and extrapolate it into some sort of moratorium on what does and does not work in college basketball.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s almost impossible to consider what just happened on the Madison Square Garden court and not think big picture. The chasm on the scoreboard was only slightly wider than the way the two programs operate.\n \n\n   \n  Tom Izzo did not spend $22 million on his roster. He didn’t even spend $10 million.\n \n\n   \n  He has a team with players that in this era might be considered endangered species - four-year guys (Carson Cooper and Jaxon Kohler), three-year guys (Coen Carr and Fears), a redshirt (Jesse McCullough) and a four-star top 60 player who averaged 3.1 minutes per game last year and came back anyway (Kur Teng).\n \n\n   \n  Playing for Izzo is no picnic. Teng isn’t the only one who could have bolted, and who no doubt was enticed with promises of cash and playing time.\n \n\n   \n  Instead they stayed, biding their time and finding their minutes along with their purposes. Teng scored 15, Kohler 20. Cooper and Carr both yanked six rebounds and Fears did his assist thing.\n \n\n   \n  More telling, at one point on Tuesday night, during a Division I college basketball game in the year 2025, the entire bench - players, managers, staff - stood up and started clapping and chanting, ‘De-fense, de-fense,’ as if this they were playing in a church-league game.\n \n\n   \n  Comparatively Kentucky’s Collin Chandler hit a three while his team trailed by 19 with two minutes left in the game and did the inject ice into my veins move as he came down the court.\n \n\n   \n  It is only November. Nothing is decided. Kentucky could very well find its groove and Michigan State could once again forget how to shoot. Both coaches know that.\n \n\n   \n  Yet as the two teams exited the building, one left in an existential crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like the identity that we felt like we carried may have been stripped away, and that’s some reality we’re facing,’’ Pope said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s an incredibly, incredibly painful process. It’s a terrifying process. If you treat it right, it can be a galvanizing process. And that comes down to the character of your organization. I think the character of our organization is terrific and tested in a big way right. But that’s the beautiful thing about sports. You either get it done or you don’t.”\n \n\n   \n  And then there was Izzo, college basketball’s perpetual Eeyore, basking in something nearing joy and satisfaction. Izzo has not hidden his disdain for either the transfer portal or the transactional nature of college athletics.\n \n\n   \n  And so when he was asked if there’s something about having guys that stick around and stick it out, he too had to temper his remarks. He took a long beat before answering, promising to be careful with his words.\n \n\n   \n  “How about 100 frickin’ percent?” he said. “They’re homegrown and they play for the name on the front of their jersey because they know the name on the front of the jersey.’’\n \n\n   \n  He wasn’t talking about Amiri.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/markets/nvidia-us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Nvidia Faces Crucial Test as AI Bubble Fears Mount","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the AI industry faces growing skepticism about whether market hype will translate into real demand, Nvidia — the backbone of AI computing and a major driver of the S&P 500 — is poised to report earnings that could confirm or challenge the sustainability of the AI boom.

The market is already nervous \n       \n  By John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market’s  recent bout of volatility . So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The stock market rally —  ﻿ that had been going practically nonstop since April until this month’s blip — largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years.\n \n\n   \n  Investors are now eager to know whether demand for Nvidia’s chips — and its optimism about the future — are continuing to grow or if there are signs of AI fatigue.\n \n\n   \n  Earnings this month from tech company Palantir ( PLTR ), which uses AI for its government contracts, beat Wall Street’s estimates. However, concerns about the stock’s expensive valuation and nerves about a bubble gave investors pause — and fueled a  sell-off in AI stocks  over the past several weeks. Nvidia’s stock ( NVDA ) has fallen more than 8% this month, although it’s still up 37% this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The market for the first time is questioning whether the hype will turn into reality,” Bob Elliott, CIO at asset management firm Unlimited Funds, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s chips power part of practically every major AI venture, meaning investors will scrutinize its earnings as well as chief executive Jensen Huang’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  “Nvidia takes on even greater weight than normal,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t confirm high expectations built into the market, then watch out below.”\n \n\n   \n    Market-moving earnings\n \n\n   \n  Every investor should care about Nvidia’s earnings this afternoon: Nvidia accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. That means investors — and those with 401(k)s — are increasingly exposed to the company’s strong gains. Similarly, they are more exposed to a drop in Nvidia’s stock price.\n \n\n   \n  As of Tuesday, Nvidia shares’ gains have accounted for 18% of the S&P 500’s total return this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n \n\n   \n  Since Nvidia last reported earnings in August, concerns have been rising about  circular financing , with tech companies entwined in a massive web of extraordinarily lucrative deals.\n \n\n   \n  Now nerves are fraying about whether the money being poured into the AI boom will be justified. On top of that, tech stocks have become relatively expensive.\n \n\n   \n  “Nvidia’s earnings on Wednesday are particularly important given the rising skepticism regarding the longevity of the AI cycle and current AI stock valuations,” James Demmert,   CIO at Main Street Research, said in an email. “Anything less than a stellar report and outlook could make stock indexes vulnerable.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’s bigger than just Wall Street. There are concerns that the AI boom — which has helped boost US economic growth this year — is now masking signs of weakness in the economy.\n \n\n   \n  At its market value of $4.4 trillion, Nvidia is currently larger than every country’s economy except the United States, China and Germany.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s fate is interlinked with other big tech companies that depend on its products.

season No. 23, marking longest career in NBA history \n       \n  By Kevin Dotson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:42 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As Los Angeles Lakers forward  LeBron James  took to the court at Crypto.com Arena Tuesday night to begin his 23rd season in the NBA, the 40-year-old added yet another record to his illustrious resumé – the longest career in league history.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Tuesday, James shared the accolade with Vince Carter, who played 22 NBA seasons from 1998 to 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just fun to be out there with the guys, man. It’s been rough mentally for me,” the four-time NBA champion said after the game, “this is the first time I’ve started a basketball season and not played since I’ve started playing basketball, like nine years old, I’ve never missed the beginning of a basketball season.”\n \n\n   \n  Sporting his famed No. 23 jersey, James was on the hardwood for the opening tip against the Utah Jazz.\n \n\n   \n  The public address announcer in the arena announced James’ achievement to a short ovation from the Lakers’ faithful during the first quarter. The future Hall of Famer acknowledged the crowd with a wave.\n \n\n   \n  The Lakers got off to a slow start, trailing by as many as 11 points early on. James was held scoreless in the opening quarter of play as the Jazz led 36-27 after 12 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  James knocked down a three-pointer from the wing early in the second quarter for the first points of his history-making season.\n \n\n   \n  As James heated up, so did the Lakers team. Los Angeles closed the gap in the second quarter and pulled away in the second half, winning comfortably, 140-126.\n \n\n   \n  James finished with a double-double, scoring 11 points and dishing out 12 assists in the game. The 21-time All-Star has now scored in double digits in a mind-boggling 1,293 consecutive games played.\n \n\n   \n  Lakers coach JJ Redick said postgame: “Just thought he played with the right spirit. Very unselfish all night. Was a willing passer, didn’t force it, took his drives and his shots when they were there.\n \n\n   \n  “The defense is going to pay attention to him, particularly when he has the ball in the post, particularly when he’s putting pressure on the rim, and I just thought he made a lot of great decisions tonight. Really good to have him back.”\n \n\n   \n  The 21-time All-Star played 30 minutes in the game, on par with the rest of the LA’s starters as the Lakers eased him back into action. James had been concerned about his stamina ahead of Tuesday’s season debut.\n \n\n   \n  “The pace tested me, but I was happy with the way I was able to go with the guys. As the game went on, my wind got a lot better. Caught my second wind, caught my third wind,” James said. “Rhythm is still coming back, obviously. First game in almost seven months, so everything that happened tonight was to be expected.”\n \n\n   \n  James missed the Lakers’ first 14 games of the 2025-26 campaign due to sciatica – a nerve issue causing pain that originates in the spine and radiates down the back of the leg.\n \n\n   \n  The  NBA’s all-time leading scorer  returned to Lakers’ practice this week after being absent from the team since the opening of training camp in early October due to what head coach JJ Redick said is a nerve irritation in his glute.\n \n\n   \n  Retirement rumors swirled around James over the course of the past year, but in June, the four-time league MVP reportedly picked up his $52.6 million option to return for an eighth season with the Lakers.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, playing in his record-tying 22nd season, James continued to display astounding productivity, averaging 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists while appearing in 70 games.\n \n\n   \n  James had scored a record 42,184 regular-season points and 50,473 with the regular season and playoffs combined ahead of Tuesday night’s debut.\n \n\n   \n  The Akron, Ohio, native entered the NBA to much fanfare as an 18-year-old after being selected No. 1 in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He turns 41 in December.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jacob Lev contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/tom-steyer-california-governor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-05:00","title":"Tom Steyer Enters California Governor's Race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tom Steyer, a billionaire Democratic activist and former presidential candidate, has officially entered the California governor’s race, stepping into a crowded field following the term limit of Governor Gavin Newsom.

A bitter legal dispute has turned it into an empty eyesore \n       \n  By Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:25 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For more than two centuries, the Antico Caffè Greco has been part of the cultural landscape of Rome. Authors and artists, movie stars and princesses — even cowboys — have all made the pilgrimage to Via dei Condotti, at the foot of the Spanish Steps, to soak up the storied atmosphere of the Italian capital’s oldest coffee house.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, that all changed. The café, a favorite for Romans and tourists, shut its doors. Portraits of former clientele — including Wild West sharpshooter Buffalo Bill — were stripped from its walls; plush red velvet chairs, seating booths and bar stools removed; gilded porcelain tableware carried away.\n \n\n   \n  The venue, as popular among Rome’s 19th-century bourgeoisie as it was with the 1960s “La Dolce Vita” in-crowd, became an empty shell.\n \n\n   \n  Antico Caffè Greco’s sudden demise was the result of a long-running rent dispute between its proprietors, Carlo Pellegrini and Flavia Iozzi, and their landlord, the Israelite Hospital of Rome. The hospital is a private institution that also provides healthcare to patients through Italy’s national health service.\n \n\n   \n  It began in September 2017 when an 80-year lease expired and the Israelite Hospital raised the monthly rent from 17,000 euros to 120,000 euros — a leap from about $20,000 to $140,000. The move, it said, was in line with other properties on the street, which is home to stores that include Gucci, Versace and Dior.\n \n\n   \n  High commercial rents have pushed many small businesses out of the center of Rome in recent years, especially since the Covid pandemic when lockdowns fueled the rise of home delivery and online shopping.\n \n\n   \n  “We would be ready to pay more rent to keep the café open but not six times the amount we’re paying now,” Pellegrini said when the Antico lease expired eight years ago. “I feel very angry, but we will fight this.”\n \n\n   \n    Casanova’s café ‘tryst’\n \n\n   \n  That fight was dealt a decisive blow in 2024, when the hospital finally won a court battle to remove the café’s occupants. It’s aim is to reopen the venue with a new tenant.\n \n\n   \n  Until last month, portraits on the walls reflected the café’s past, including the day in 1890 when Buffalo Bill  took his morning coffee  there with some fellow cowboys. It was a favorite haunt of Charles Dickens, Henry James and John Keats in the 19th century. Later, Orson Welles, Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren all spent time there.\n \n\n   \n  Notorious 18th-century seducer Giacomo Casanova even mentioned a “tryst” at the café in his memoir. The sofa in the back where it was said to have taken place became popular with lovers over the centuries since.\n \n\n   \n  Despite above-average prices, customers always seemed to think sipping a cappuccino or hot chocolate from the same cups as Pablo Picasso or Princess Diana was worth paying extra.\n \n\n   \n  Pellegrini and Iozzi were formally evicted in October after losing five appeals and retrials.\n \n\n   \n  The café was shuttered with the help of the military police. The locks were changed and the heavy wooden doors closed for the last time. Lawyers for the hospital removed a temporary “closed for vacation” sign that had been taped to the doors since September.\n \n\n   \n  The court stipulated that the hospital must preserve the historical integrity of the property, but departing staff told CNN through their lawyer that they removed the café’s artwork in September, which included portraits, sculptures and memorabilia said to be worth around 8 million euros, fearing damage from a leaking pipe.\n \n\n   \n  Antonio Maria Leozappa, special commissioner for the Israelite Hospital, told CNN the removed works and furnishings have since been seized by authorities and are now being protected by Italy’s Culture Ministry until new tenants can be found. He said that the hospital was not seeking backpayment from Pellegrini for an annual 100,000 euros rent shortfall since the legal battle began eight years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The Israelite Hospital is a public health asset, and the revenue generated by its properties has always been and will always be used by the Israelite Hospital, an institution affiliated with the National Health System, for the sole purpose of improving healthcare,” the hospital said in a  statement  in 2023 after having won one of many court battles.  It said the rent increase was an attempt to improve healthcare “for the benefit of all citizens.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A tragedy’\n \n\n   \n  Leozappa said the café will open again once work is done in the building. “It is a historic café, it is one of the first in Italy, it dates back to the late 18th century,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Under a new owner, the Antico Caffè Greco will “continue to enjoy a long history, respecting tradition and the established regulations, and the historic character of the place will be preserved,” he added. ”The city, Romans, and tourists will continue to enjoy their coffee at the Antico Caffè Greco for centuries to come.”\n \n\n   \n  Pellegrini isn’t ready to give up the battle just yet. “The matter cannot be closed like this,” his lawyer, Alessandro Ciciarelli, said when the locks were changed.\n \n\n   \n  Whatever happens next, the once-grand space is now an eyesore on one of the most prestigious streets in the city center — one of many empty storefronts, some of which sit vacant for years, that have appeared as a result of soaring commercial and residential prices.\n \n\n   \n  The Antico Caffè Greco’s wooden outdoor terrace now has signs that its empty planters   are not garbage bins.” Curious tourists peer through the windows into the empty space. Inside, the lights are on, but no one is making coffee.\n \n\n   \n  “I came here every day for almost 15 years,” Manuel Capponi, an elderly local who lives at the top of the Spanish Steps, told CNN. “It is a tragedy that it had to close this way, the fights, the anger. But this café — and this city — have weathered worse storms. There will be another café and I’m sure the prices will reflect the higher rent.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/weather/polar-vortex-cold-snowy-december-stratosphere","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"07:36:00-05:00","title":"The polar vortex is about to bring a wild weather pattern change","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sudden stratospheric warming event in the polar stratosphere is causing the polar vortex to weaken and potentially reverse, which could lead to cold, snowy conditions across the Northern Hemisphere — especially in the central and eastern U.S., Europe, and Asia — within the next month.

atmosphere  rarely noticed and even less understood , a transformation is underway. Over the next 10 days, changes in the stratosphere will upend weather patterns and set the stage for a cold, snowy December across parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\n \n\n   \n  It will mean a dramatic swing in weather for parts of the US that are currently simmering in record heat just a week before Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  It could also be one of the earliest significant  polar vortex disruptions  recorded since the dawn of the satellite era.\n \n\n   \n  Think of the stratospheric polar vortex   like a wall of wind, corralling the ultra-cold, Arctic air over the North Pole. When it weakens, cold air spills south into places like the Lower 48, Europe and Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, the air in the stratosphere — the layer of the atmosphere above where most weather occurs — is warming quickly and dramatically, in a phenomenon known as a  sudden stratospheric warming event .\n \n\n   \n  But the sudden warming in the far upper atmosphere is going to result in anything but warmth. It is causing the polar vortex winds to weaken, said Amy H. Butler, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they could even reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists are still trying to figure out why these warming events happen, and for good reason: they can trigger the most intense “polar vortex” cold-air outbreaks in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next two weeks, these shifts could start to be felt in North America, Europe and Asia as the polar vortex weakens and tumbles south, like a spinning top that slows and wobbles off course.\n \n\n   \n  One unusual feature of this event is its timing; sudden stratospheric warming events of this magnitude are almost unheard of in November, said meteorologist Judah Cohen, a research scientist at MIT.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still not certain there will be a major winter blast, but scientists are watching for colder than normal conditions to develop in the mid-latitudes — where most of the world’s population resides — over the next month or so. Once the polar vortex is disrupted, it can take a month or more to recover, said Andrea Lopez Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n \n\n   \n  What’s most difficult to predict is where the polar vortex will deliver its icy blast, and the temperature outlooks aren’t taking it fully into account, yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see more active and shifted storm tracks and increases in cold air outbreaks in regions across the Northern Hemisphere,” she said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Both Butler and Lopez Lang said having accurate forecasts for polar vortex events can help make 7- to 10-day forecasts better, which can be beneficial for decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Even though the stratospheric polar vortex is miles above us, it’s sometimes connected to our weather via invisible puppet strings we describe with atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics,” Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  For example, other polar vortex events early in the winter have been followed by colder and snowier Decembers in the US, she said. Polar vortex events like these tend to generate a ridge of warm, high pressure over Alaska, which triggers a dip, or trough, in the jet stream to the east. That trough can usher in colder, snowier weather over the Central states and portions of the Eastern US.    \n \n\n   \n  As impactful as these polar vortex events are, scientists are losing some of their eyes on this layer of the atmosphere, Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  Satellites are crucial to observing the stratosphere and making predictions about sudden stratospheric warming events,   she said, and some of that data is blinking out as satellites age and  NOAA makes budget and program decisions  that affect the availability of current and future measurements. She cited some  newly missing data from polar-orbiting satellites  as an example.\n \n\n   \n  “The only way that we really observe these phenomena is via satellite data,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/lame-duck-presidency-trump-epstein-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00+00:00","title":"Is Trump a lame duck now?

Wolf, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For the first time in his second term, President Donald Trump was confronted by his fellow Republicans. And he fell in line.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than face a massive defection of Republican votes in the House,  Trump flipped to support a bill  to force the Department of Justice to release non-classified files related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The flip-flop was a long time coming. The House of Representatives stayed out of session for more than a month during the government shutdown, which helped to shield Trump from this vote. After Trump ultimately endorsed the bill he had previously opposed, there was near-unanimity  when the House voted on it Tuesday .\n \n\n   \n  It now appears to be on a glide path to Trump’s desk.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear that Trump will appear in the remainder of the files as he did in  emails from Epstein’s estate  released by the House Oversight Committee last week. But it’s definitely clear that Trump has no interest in continuing to talk about Epstein. When a reporter asked Trump in the Oval Office Tuesday why he doesn’t just release the files, he shot back that she was a bad reporter.\n \n\n   \n  “Quiet, piggy,” was how he sternly reacted with a pointed finger to another reporter last week on Air Force One when she asked about the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  The argument that seems to have convinced Republicans to break with Trump on releasing the Epstein files and vote was best expressed by Rep. Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who has tangled with the administration on multiple issues.\n \n\n   \n  “The deal for Republicans on this vote is that Trump will protect you if you vote the wrong way,” Massie told CNN’s Manu Raju last week. “In other words, if you vote to cover up for pedophiles, you’ve got cover in a Republican primary. But I would remind my colleagues that this vote is gonna be on your record for longer than Trump is gonna be president.”\n \n\n   \n  Pair that sentiment with Trump’s recent acknowledgment that he will not be on the ballot in 2028, which means he won’t be president in 2029, and you have the makings of a lame-duck presidency.\n \n\n   \n  There are other issues dividing the GOP, as  CNN’s Aaron Blake noted Tuesday.  In addition to the Epstein files, Republicans are grousing about Trump’s foreign focus; his apparent  lack of understanding of the issue of  affordability  and how it relates to his tariff policy; the destruction of the White House East Wing; and the way his family is appearing to enrich itself.\n \n\n   \n  Pretty much all of these issues were on display at Trump’s Oval Office appearance Monday, when he sat next to and defended  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman .\n \n\n   \n  None of this means that Republican lawmakers are going to turn on Trump en masse in the near future. But it does mean you will hear that term, lame duck, with more frequency.\n \n\n   \n    What is a lame duck?\n \n\n   \n  Believe it or not, “lame duck” is a technical term in US politics. Historians in both the House and Senate track lame-duck terms.\n \n\n   \n  To them, it refers to a politician in the period after their successor has been elected, but before that person is sworn in. The outgoing politician still technically has power, but is no longer really accountable to voters.\n \n\n   \n    Is Trump a lame duck now?\n \n\n   \n  From a technical standpoint, no. US voters will vote twice before Trump leaves office: in midterms next year and the general election to replace him in 2028. His presidency will play a factor in both of those elections. The government will have to be funded each year, and natural disasters and other events will require leadership.\n \n\n   \n  But the term also has a more colloquial meaning that refers to anyone who can’t be reelected. That included Trump starting on Day 1 of his second term. But his superpower in recent years has been his hold over the Republican Party. That power, at least in theory, will fade a smidge every time he asks Republican lawmakers to do something voters will not like.\n \n\n   \n    Lame-duck presidencies can be dangerous times\n \n\n   \n  Just because a president is losing power does not mean there is nothing important going on. The ultimate lame-duck disaster occurred in 1860, after the election of Abraham Lincoln but before he was sworn in. That’s when Southern states started seceding from the union,  starting with South Carolina in December .\n \n\n   \n  George W. Bush ushered in a bailout to the financial system during the Great Recession just before his successor, Barack Obama, was elected.\n \n\n   \n    How have lame ducks changed?\n \n\n   \n  The 20th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1933 in part to shorten the length of lame-duck sessions. Originally, in the pre-modern horse-and-buggy era, unless the president called Congress into session earlier, lawmakers would not convene for a new Congress until  13 months  after Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a lot more time than that — a little less than 36 months — until the next presidential election.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/style/celebrities-spring-summer-2026-fashion","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:08:00-04:00","title":"From the runway to the wild: Celebrities are already stepping out in clothes designers want you to wear next spring","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Spring-Summer 2026 fashion season marked a shift in how fashion brands promote their designs, with high-profile celebrities like Greta Lee (Dior), Sarah Paulson (Balenciaga), and Michelle Obama wearing runway looks in public events such as film premieres and galas.

next spring \n       \n  By Kati Chitrakorn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:08 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Spring-Summer 2026 collections, shown across the main fashion capitals of New York, London, Milan and Paris during September and October, marked a season of significant change as a number of high-profile designers made their debuts at big brands. While many of those designs are not yet available for general purchase or widespread red-carpet wear, they’ve already been spotted in the wild — worn by an exclusive few.\n \n\n   \n  Getting their clothes on famous individuals is important for brands. “In some cases, it’s because the brands have employed these people as ambassadors, so they’re on payroll,” said Booth Moore, a veteran editor and author of books including “American Runway,” pointing to the actor Greta Lee, who was recently named as a global face for Dior and has attended several high-profile events wearing the brand’s latest designs. “In other cases, it’s people who are highly visible because they have a show or film to promote, like Sarah Paulson who has been wearing Balenciaga. Sometimes, it’s just a one-off, like we’ve seen with Michelle Obama, who is arguably one of the most visible women in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Only a few years ago, the red carpet was representative of fashion’s production schedule, with celebrities wearing runway looks around the time that the collections arrived in stores. These moments played a key part in motivating shoppers to buy — even if it is a more affordable lipstick or perfume. That pipeline has now shrunk to reflect shorter attention spans: what was shown on the catwalk a mere month ago can now be seen at movie premieres, film festivals, awards ceremonies, talk shows, galas, and other glitzy celebrity events, which seem to be multiplying in abundance.\n \n\n   \n  Some fashion designers, including Dario Vitale of Versace, have sped things up even further by  showing their designs on the red carpet even before they hit the catwalk . “There are a record number of brands trying to change their image at the same time,” said Moore. “They’re in races against each other, and their reliance on Hollywood as a promotional machine has increased so much in recent years, that there’s this kind-of feeding frenzy to reach the right people, and to get to them first.”\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the competition is now heated among stylists to outdo each other, as they vie for the approval of online commentators and the media’s best-dressed lists. For some, there is kudos in  reviving an archival or vintage design , but for many others, being the first to wear something still translates to access, status, and trend-setting power. And while celebrities have typically worn custom designs to the biggest red carpet events, any occasion now seems to be fair game.\n \n\n   \n  See the latest catwalk looks — and who wore them where — below.\n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/middleeast/iran-us-nuclear-talks-intw-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00-04:00","title":"Exclusive: Iran open to resuming nuclear talks with the US but won’t shift its conditions, supreme leader’s adviser says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran has signaled willingness to resume nuclear negotiations with the United States, emphasizing that talks must occur on equal terms and with mutual respect.

      \nUpdated: \n        5:01 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran is willing to resume  nuclear talks with the United States  if they are conducted respectfully, a senior Iranian official told CNN on Tuesday, while insisting Tehran will not move from the position it held before the  US and Israel attacked it in June. \n \n\n   \n  “They have to make the first move to show that they are ready to engage with us on the conditions that we put… it has to be based on equal footing and mutual respect,” said Kamal Kharrazi, foreign policy adviser to Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , in an exclusive interview with CNN from Tehran. “The agenda would be prepared in advance to ensure the clarity of substance and the process of discussions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, President (Donald) Trump does not believe in diplomatic engagement but rather prefers to use force to achieve his objectives,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Later on Tuesday, Trump said that Iran is “very much” signaling interest in striking a deal with the US over its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  “They’d like very much to make a deal with us, and they call us, and we’ll end up probably doing that, that’s Iran,” Trump said in a room filled with high-profile guests at a White House dinner honoring Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s comments echoed remarks he made earlier in the day, when he indicated he was open to pursuing negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Kharrazi indicated that Iran’s conditions for a rapprochement with Washington have not changed since the US and Israel struck its nuclear facilities in June, adding that uranium enrichment will continue because the country needs the fuel for its power plants and for medical purposes. Tehran’s ballistic missile program, which he said is expanding, will also be off the negotiating table. “It is only the nuclear issue we will discuss with the United States,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration and Iran were in the middle of talks to settle their dispute in June when Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran, eventually drawing in Washington, which carried out strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, the first direct US attack inside Iran.\n \n\n   \n  Almost five months on, the damage to Iran’s nuclear facilities has yet to be assessed, Kharrazi said.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Saeed Khatibzadeh told CNN that despite serious damage to “infrastructure, machineries” and “buildings,” the country’s nuclear program  remained “intact.”  On the same day, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that no uranium enrichment was taking place “right now” because the country’s facilities had been attacked.\n \n\n   \n  During the Iran-US talks in the summer, Washington had insisted that Iran stop enriching uranium altogether, while Tehran was adamant about continuing domestic enrichment to a purity that cannot be used to build nuclear bombs. Highly enriched uranium is a key component of a nuclear weapon.\n \n\n   \n  Kharrazi said the “degree of enrichment,” not enrichment itself, would be the focus of potential negotiations with the US.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he is concerned about another military confrontation with the US or Israel, he said: “Everything is possible. But we are ready for that.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported in June that Washington had made a proposal for a nuclear deal under which the US would invest in Iran’s civilian nuclear power program and  join a consortium  that would oversee the enrichment of low-level uranium inside Iran for an unspecified amount of time. That potential consortium would be expected to include Middle Eastern nations and the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Iranian officials repeatedly said they are open to the idea of an enrichment consortium but insisted Iran must be able to keep control of its own enrichment capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN if there is room to reach an understanding with the US on Iran’s nuclear program, including on a potential consortium, Kharrazi said, “I think so.”\n \n\n   \n  “If there would be genuine negotiations between Iran and the United States, there are ways and means (of) how to ensure that Iran can continue its enrichment and at the same time assure the others that it’s not going to look for nuclear weapons.”\n \n\n   \n  Kharrazi also had a message for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Start with a positive approach with Iran. If it will be positive, certainly it will be reciprocated. But for that, they (the US) have to refrain from any force against Iran,” he said. “They have tried that and they now understand that it’s not acceptable and it’s not workable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/europe/denmark-asylum-immigration-system-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:32:00-04:00","title":"Denmark’s hardline immigration laws have caught Britain’s eye.

But now, European leaders think it has something more valuable to sell: an immigration system tough and effective enough to neuter the hard right and keep mainstream parties in power.\n \n\n   \n  Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, has achieved what many center-left governments of recent years have found impossible: getting reelected. In an age when incumbents keep getting hammered at the ballot box, many in Europe are looking to the asylum policies of Frederiksen’s Social Democrats – which won elections in 2019, 2022, and, polls show, are on course to win again in 2026 – as a model to imitate.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s  Labour government  – which has been hounded by the  populist Reform UK party  over its struggle to control  illegal immigration  – has been so impressed by the Danish model that it sent officials to find out how the system works.\n \n\n   \n  Announcing a  radical overhaul  of Britain’s asylum system on Monday, Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, said while Britain had “held rigidly to the old model, other countries have tightened theirs.” She singled out Denmark as a poster child.\n \n\n   \n  The old model referenced by Mahmood is a creature of Europe’s post-war milieu. The United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951 applied only to Europe and sought to settle wartime refugees – primarily Jews who survived the Holocaust, ethnic Germans expelled from Eastern Europe and dissidents fleeing Soviet regimes. The treaty was expanded in 1967 to apply universally, in part to atone for colonialism.\n \n\n   \n  But the proliferation of conflict and climate disasters – coupled with cheap travel, rising rates of literacy, and the ease of online communication – has put immense strain on the post-war architecture of asylum. At the end of last year, 123 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced according to the UN, up from about 44 million people in 2010. “Our asylum system was not designed to cope with this,” Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said bluntly Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Britain is now poised to embark on a policy route first charted by Denmark a decade ago. In 2015, Europe received its most requests for asylum in a single year since World War II, as civil wars in  Syria  and Libya helped spur around 1.3 million people to travel to the region, mostly from the Middle East. When Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said “Wir schaffen das (We can do it)!” urging Germans to  welcome in refugees , Denmark took a different approach.\n \n\n   \n  Under Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Frederiksen’s predecessor as prime minister who then led the center-right Venstre party, Denmark aimed to reduce the number of asylum seekers, improve integration, and swiftly deport those who arrived illegally.\n \n\n   \n  Rasmussen, who is now the foreign minister, first made refugee status temporary, not permanent. Before 2015, refugees could stay in Denmark for five years, after which their residence permits would automatically become permanent. Now, residence permits last for only one or two years, and refugees must wait for eight years before they can apply for permanent status. Even then, it is not guaranteed: Refugees must be fluent in Danish and have held a full-time job for several years.\n \n\n   \n  Denmark has also made it harder for refugees to be joined by family members. Both must be aged 24 and above and have passed a Danish language test. The refugee must not have claimed government benefits for the past three years, and they must also put up a financial guarantee.\n \n\n   \n  Michala Clante Bendixen, head of the refugee advisory group Refugees Welcome Denmark, said removing the assumption that refugee status will become permanent has been detrimental to integration.\n \n\n   \n  “Attachment to the labor market, learning the language and understanding the society – these are very important things for successful integration,” Bendixen told CNN. But she feared the tightened requirements had “set the bar too high” for many new arrivals, discouraging some from trying at all – particularly older people with lower levels of education.\n \n\n   \n  “It creates a feeling of hopelessness. I’ve met so many refugees who say, ‘No matter what we do, it’s never good enough. I have done everything they require of me, and still it’s not enough,’” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Denmark has also been criticized for its policy on “ghettos” (now termed “parallel societies”), which allows the state to sell off or demolish housing estates where more than 50% of residents are from “non-Western” backgrounds. Successive Danish governments had worried about poor levels of integration in certain neighborhoods. In 2004, then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned of areas where “the men are unemployed, the women are isolated, and the families speak only the language of their home country.”\n \n\n   \n  A charitable interpretation of the “ghetto” law, introduced in 2018, is that it supports integration by encouraging people from different backgrounds to live together, not merely side-by-side. But not everyone is convinced. In February, a senior adviser to the EU’s top court said the policy amounts to discrimination based on ethnic origin.\n \n\n   \n  Other laws have also been criticized by human rights groups. Under the so-called “jewelry law,” authorities can seize assets worth over 10,000 Danish Krone (around $1,500) to help cover the cost of asylum support. The measure was only applied 17 times over its first six years, but still has dark historical resonances, with some drawing comparisons to confiscations of valuables by the Nazi regime.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Performative cruelty’\n \n\n   \n  Few dispute that Denmark’s policies have achieved their stated aim. In 2014, Denmark granted refugee status to 6,031 people. By 2019, that figure had dropped to 1,737.\n \n\n   \n  While Denmark grants far more residence permits today than it did 30 years ago, the vast majority of these go to students and workers, not refugees. Of the 99,811 residence permits Denmark granted last year, just 859 went to asylum seekers – less than 1%.\n \n\n   \n  “Denmark in recent decades has shown that it is politically and practically feasible to transition to a system of overall higher migration, and more employment- and education-intensive immigration,” according to a report last month from Bruegel, a Brussels-based economic think tank.\n \n\n   \n  Over time, this has deterred refugees from seeking asylum in Denmark. Britain’s Home Office said Denmark’s policies had reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the removal of 95% of those whose claims are rejected. In 2024, there were four new asylum claims per 10,000 people in Denmark, compared to 16 per 10,000 in Britain, and 20 per 20,000 for the European Union as a whole.\n \n\n   \n  Although the Danish model has won the Social Democrats praise abroad, some are growing disillusioned at home. In local elections Tuesday, Frederiksen’s party lost control of Copenhagen for the first time in more than a century. While much of the discontent is over the capital’s high housing costs, analysts say the party’s hardline stance on immigration has alienated its more progressive urban base.\n \n\n   \n  Whether the Danish model can be imported wholesale by other governments remains to be seen. Britain plans to quadruple the wait for permanent settlement from five years to 20 – much longer than the eight-year wait for refugees in Denmark. A refugee’s status will be reviewed every two-and-a-half years; if their home country is deemed to have become safe during that time, they will be deported. Those seeking asylum could also be stripped of assets including jewelry to cover the costs of their accommodation.\n \n\n   \n  Bendixen warned the new 20-year path to permanent settlement would destroy refugees’ sense of the future and make them “feel like they are second class citizens forever.”\n \n\n   \n  “Integration fails when you give young people the feeling that they don’t belong. That’s where you see gangs and crime and areas where people have their own rules. That’s because they don’t feel like they’re part of society. A rule like this would make (that feeling) much, much stronger,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Many UK Labour Party politicians would agree. Although Starmer, like Frederiksen, insists that a more stringent asylum system is compatible with the progressive values of compassion and tolerance, others say the proposals are needlessly cruel and will not have the desired effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Plans to leave refugees in a state of perpetual uncertainty about where and if they can rebuild their lives are not just performative cruelty, they are counterproductive to integration and the economy,” Stella Creasy, a Labour MP, said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Alf Dubs, a Labour member of the House of Lords who came to Britain on the Kindertransport in 1939 fleeing the persecution of Jews in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, told the BBC that he was “depressed” by Labour’s hardline turn, and called the new measures “a shabby thing.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/stimulus-check-trump-tariff-dividend","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"4 Reasons You Probably Won’t Get a $2,000 Check from Trump Soon (and 1 Scary Reason You Might)","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has promised to issue $2,000 tariff rebate checks to individuals in 2026 as a form of economic relief, but experts and analysts argue that the plan faces massive obstacles.

Analysis by Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has promised to deliver $2,000 tariff rebate checks next year, raising hopes of a lifeline for millions of Americans  struggling to make ends meet .\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money. We’re going to be issuing dividends…probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that, of thousands of dollars for individuals of moderate income, middle income,”  Trump said  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump has suggested  these checks  are essentially a done deal, the reality is there are major, perhaps insurmountable,  obstacles standing in the way .\n \n\n   \n  Experts tell CNN it is improbable the federal government will  send out $2,000 checks  next year – unless it looks like the US economy needs to be rescued from an imminent recession.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s highly unlikely there is some sort of stimulus check sent out next year. I would be pretty shocked,” Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, told CNN in a phone interview.\n \n\n   \n  Bettors on prediction platform Polymarket seem to agree. They  place just an 11% chance  that Trump creates a tariff dividend by March 31.\n \n\n   \n     The math doesn’t math \n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the biggest obstacle is that the numbers don’t add up.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs are undoubtedly generating gobs of money for the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new tariffs are projected to raise $158.4 billion in total revenue in 2025, and another $207.5 billion in 2026, according to  estimates  from the Tax Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to say exactly how much tariff dividend checks will cost because virtually no details have been released.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the Tax Foundation modeled three designs for tariff dividends – and all of them would cost more than the new tariffs are projected to bring in this year.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, if the checks went out only to tax filers and spouses, and had a hard cut off at $100,000 in individual income, they would still cost $279.8 billion, according to the analysis. That’s $121 billion more than projected new tariff revenue this year.\n \n\n   \n  At the high end of the scenarios analyzed, tariff dividends could go out to tax filers and non-filers as well as spouses and dependents. That would cost up to $606.8 billion – or nearly double the combined 2025 and 2026 projected new tariff revenue.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a problem because the Trump administration has already held up tariff revenue as a way to offset the cost of the sweeping tax and spending package Trump signed into law earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  “This is like the magic money tree. You just go to it anytime you need money. Of course, that’s not reality,” said Lincicome.\n \n\n   \n     The votes may not be there \n \n\n   \n  Another major problem is Congress would need to sign off on dividend checks – and it’s far from clear there are the votes for that.\n \n\n   \n  Deficit hawks were already reluctant to back the president’s tax law and this would only magnify budget worries.\n \n\n   \n  “I find it extremely implausible that Republican budget hawks are just going to be okay with blowing another $300 billion to $600 billion,” Lincicome.\n \n\n   \n  After topping $34 trillion for the first time in January 2024, the national debt has continued to mount,  hitting $38 trillion  late last month.\n \n\n   \n     Dividend checks could backfire \n \n\n   \n  There’s no doubt many Americans could use $2,000 checks from Uncle Sam as they struggle to catch up to high prices at the grocery store, on car insurance and elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  However, some economists warn that stimulus checks could backfire by worsening the affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  The problem is that while some people may use the money to pay down debt, others would likely spend it, and that would increase demand. As the last inflation crisis demonstrated, boosting demand without increasing supply drives up prices.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, many Republicans blamed former President Joe Biden’s 2021 stimulus checks for causing the inflation crisis. That could make it difficult for those same lawmakers to support Trump-era stimulus checks.\n \n\n   \n  Academic research has found those  stimulus checks contributed  to the four-decade high in inflation, though they were hardly the only factor. Trillions of dollars in other stimulus, including Trump’s 2020 stimulus checks and the Paycheck Protection Program also contributed.\n \n\n   \n  Even some Trump-friendly economists are highly skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending out checks to people is a bad way to stimulate the economy,” Stephen Moore, co-founder of Unleash Prosperity and a former Trump economic adviser, told CNN in an email. “If there is tariff revenue, that should be used to cut income taxes across the board. Stimulus checks only stimulate inflation.”\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, redeploying tariff revenue to pay for dividend payments risks sparking a  revolt among the so-called bond vigilantes  that drives up Treasury yields that set a benchmark for a number of loan rates. That in turn would make it even more expensive for small businesses to borrow and homebuyers to get a mortgage.\n \n\n   \n  “What Congress and Trump are trying to do with stimulus, the bond market could take away instantly,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James.\n \n\n   \n  That’s one reason stimulus checks are normally reserved for actual emergencies like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n     Supreme Court could wipe out tariff revenue \n \n\n   \n  Beyond the budget, political and economic obstacles, there are legal ones, too.\n \n\n   \n  Most Supreme Court justices during oral arguments earlier this month  sounded skeptical  about Trump’s reliance on emergency powers to impose his global tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The Tax Foundation estimates the tariffs that could get struck down account for about 75% of the new tariff revenue coming in.\n \n\n   \n  “If the Supreme Court says the bulk of the tariffs are illegal, that could throw a wrench in the tariff rebate plan,” said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  For all these reasons, investors and economists on Wall Street are hardly counting on the arrival of $2,000 tariff dividend checks in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve learned that late night Truth Socials are not a direct line to reality,” said Bob Elliott, CEO and chief investment officer at alternative investment firm Unlimited.\n \n\n   \n     ‘Break-the-glass’ moment? \n \n\n   \n  However, one way Trump’s $2,000 dividend checks could become a reality is if they become a necessity.\n \n\n   \n  If trouble in the job market intensifies and the unemployment rate climbs significantly, then the White House could argue direct payments are necessary to prevent a recession or minimize the damage of one.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s almost like we shouldn’t want stimulus checks to happen,” Mills said, “because it would be an indicator of something wrong. This is a break-the-glass, use in case of emergency tool.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/gop-failed-censure-vote-plaskett-mills","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"13:15:00Z","title":"Failed effort to censure Democrat over texts with Epstein sparks recriminations in the GOP","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A failed House censure effort against Democrat Stacey Plaskett, who had text exchanges with Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing, sparked accusations from conservative Republicans of a secret backroom deal in which Democrats dropped a planned censure of Florida Republican Cory Mills in exchange for sparing Plaskett from reprimand.

     4:04 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   China  has warned there is “no market” for  Japanese seafood exports,  the latest veiled threat from Beijing as its diplomatic spat with Tokyo escalates over recent comments by Japan’s leader on defending Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  The two neighbors have been engaged in a  rapidly spiraling dispute  after Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi, in response to a question in parliament, said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival,” and thus could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan’s sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a week, China and its state media has issued near daily denunciations of Takaichi   as well as threats to economically punish Tokyo unless the comments are retracted.\n \n\n   \n  Seafood emerged as the latest pressure point at a regular press briefing on Wednesday from China’s foreign ministry.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the erroneous remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on important Taiwan issues, there has been strong public outrage in China,” spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters. “Under the current circumstances, even if Japanese seafood were exported to China, there would be no market for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Mao was responding to reports earlier that day in Japanese media that China had already informed Tokyo that it planned to ban seafood exports from Japan. Both NHK and Kyodo ran the reports, citing sources.\n \n\n   \n  However Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters Tokyo has yet to receive any confirmation from the Chinese government on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Mao’s response did not confirm a ban was in place, but it has raised the prospect that one might be on its way as well as further punitive measures.\n \n\n   \n  “Japan should first retract its erroneous remarks and take concrete actions to safeguard the political foundation of China-Japan relations; otherwise, China will have no choice but to take further measures,” Mao said.\n \n\n   \n    Fukhshima era ban\n \n\n   \n  China had only  partly resumed imports  of seafood from Japan earlier this year after banning them in August 2023 in response to Tokyo’s decision to begin releasing treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused water within the plant to be contaminated with highly radioactive material. Tokyo had argued that it had treated the water properly, but Beijing had long led regional opposition to the water being returned to the ocean.\n \n\n   \n  The threat of a new   seafood ban comes after Beijing last week advised its citizens against travelling to Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Although the move is non-binding, it is hugely symbolic – nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern later published notices on their websites offering customers refunds or free changes on certain tickets to Japan, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  Japanese companies are starting to report cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  Tokyo-based tour operator East Japan International Travel Service said it had lost 70% of its bookings for the remainder of the year, because of the ongoing row between Japan and China.\n \n\n   \n  Yu Jinxin, the company’s vice president, told CNN it was “a huge loss for us”, adding Chinese tour groups are a key part of their business.\n \n\n   \n  “We can withstand a short-term impact of one to two months, but if the situation becomes prolonged, the financial strain on our operations will be significant,” Yu added.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response to avoid ruffling feathers in China – Japan’s biggest trade partner.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi,  a hawk who has pushed to strengthen Japan’s defense capacity,  visited Taiwan earlier this year – before she became Prime Minister – and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time.\n \n\n   \n  She has previously criticized Beijing’s increasing military presence in East Asia, and during the APEC summit, she met with Taiwan’s representative, again angering China.\n \n\n   \n  She met Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the same summit, at which she said she had asked China to resume imports of Japanese beef and seafood imports.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Mai Takiguchi and Kloe Zheng contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/texas-judge-blocks-ten-commandments-law","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:40:00-05:00","title":"Texas judge temporarily blocks law requiring Ten Commandments in schools","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Orlando L.

vote that ‘ripped MAGA apart’ \n       \n  By Edward-Isaac Dovere, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The House vote  to release the Jeffrey Epstein files  was, in the end, 427-1. That’s a margin typically reserved for proclamations and post office namings, not for what was  perhaps the biggest defeat  of President Donald Trump’s second term, a fight that GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene declared on Tuesday had “ripped MAGA apart.”\n \n\n   \n  A group of Epstein’s survivors, sitting together in one section of the House gallery, applauded. Democrats applauded. Some Republicans applauded. No one seemed to say much to Rep. Ro Khanna as he stood in the center of the floor, toward the front, chitchatting with colleagues. When Illinois Rep. Joshua Jackson patted Khanna on the back a moment later, it wasn’t clear if he was acknowledging Khanna’s work or just trying to squeeze by to get to someone on the other side.\n \n\n   \n  That morning, Khanna had noticed that Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, his Republican co-sponsor on  the discharge petition leading to Tuesday’s vote , were trending on X and he wasn’t. He is trying to be fine with that, as playing down the Democratic role to woo Republican support was always part of the plan. He offered a “Schoolhouse Rock”-like optimism about legislating, saying, “It feels like you can make a difference in Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  But Khanna doesn’t hide his belief that Tuesday’s triumph proves he should be taken seriously as a party leader and maybe even for the long-shot 2028 presidential run he is always happy to talk about. He argues the vote vindicates the value of his long relationships with Republicans – he and Massie connected years ago working on  legislation to halt US military support to Saudi Arabia  for its war in Yemen – and his willingness to talk to almost any party.\n \n\n   \n  “I make no secret about wanting to be part of shaping the national future of the Democratic Party of this country. I make no secret about the fact that I believe I have the best economic vision for this nation,” he said in an interview with CNN before the vote, ticking through his emphasis on forgotten communities abandoned by billionaires he says have rigged the system.\n \n\n   \n  “The knock on me from some — I mean, there are many knocks on me — but one of the knocks on me has always been: ‘Okay, Ro, you can write books on this, you can write op-eds on this, but can you really, brass tacks, get things done?’ And it’s easier if you’re a mayor or a governor or a Cabinet member to show you can get things done. And what this is showing is, you know what? On one of the biggest things, which is getting MAGA on board, it’s not just ideas. I’m able to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n  Others are willing to give him credit too.\n \n\n   \n  “It took him on his side and me on my side, and our working relationship before this, to be able to do this,” Massie said after finishing thanking the survivors at their press conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning. “Our chance of success was about 4 percent at the beginning, and we’re going to succeed. So I am a little bit surprised. I’m used to fighting battles and not winning.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think Ro Khanna is a brilliant human being. I think he stands for justice. He’s on the right side of history,” said Haley Robson, an Epstein survivor helping organize the trembling “sister survivors” who tend to arrive holding up pictures of themselves when they first met Epstein, speaking to CNN after the vote. “If it wasn’t for Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ro Khanna, I don’t think any of this would have been possible. They are just incredible people who genuinely care.”\n \n\n   \n    How he strategized\n \n\n   \n  Khanna, a 47-year-old who represents Silicon Valley, has gotten used to often getting a better reception as the token Democrat on right-wing media than he does from some of his colleagues. This time, he’d like a little more credit for being ahead of the curve.\n \n\n   \n  “In the beginning,” he told CNN, “I’m not going to say who, but some of the folks in our own party were like, eyerolls, ‘There goes Ro on one of his issues…’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of eggs?’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of health care?’ ‘What’s up with this?’ And I said, ‘No, there is something legitimate here.’”\n \n\n   \n  That included building a relationship with Greene, whom he said he barely knew before – but had never blasted on Twitter like so many of his colleagues – and now texts with. Or carefully maneuvering how to get Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert in September to sign the discharge petition that forced the vote. Massie relayed that she’d do it if she didn’t have to wait in line, so Khanna pulled the paper away from a Democratic colleague on the House floor and let her walk over and do it.\n \n\n   \n  To report about Khanna is to inspire exasperation from political journalists and operatives who’ve rued for years how many stories the congressman always manages to put himself into as the hinge point.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also to hear from a person who speaks to Barack Obama often that the former president keeps an eye on Khanna as an administration alumnus (Khanna was a deputy assistant commerce secretary in the first term, before launching a primary against an incumbent whom Obama endorsed). Without overstating it, the person said, Obama “appreciates that Ro is willing to show up across all varieties of platforms.”\n \n\n   \n  That gives Khanna a phone full of contacts to promote himself and his ideas, from MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon to forever never-Trumper Bill Kristol to  Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president whom Khanna is now disgusted to think he was on the phone with arguing about economic policy just weeks ago. The batch of Epstein estate emails  released last week revealed Summers had been asking Epstein for advice  on how to sleep with a mentee of his until just before Epstein’s final arrest.\n \n\n   \n  “If there was no media attention to this,” Khanna said, “this thing would never have gotten a vote. So the idea of politicians being ambitious to raise issues they care about to the American public is a good thing, if the ambition is for a good public purpose. This idea that we should not be savvy about getting our message out in the media is setting us up for being ineffective.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who voted for and touted the win, didn’t respond when asked what the Democratic leader made of Khanna’s pushing the bill through.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Bacon, the retiring Nebraska Republican who’s become friendly with Khanna through their subcommittee work, argued Republicans always wanted to release the files, despite Speaker Mike Johnson in a floor speech on Tuesday calling the vote a distraction from “urgent legislative work.”\n \n\n   \n  “It could have been anybody” leading the charge, Bacon said. Then he reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  “He was smart enough to get on it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Anger and regrets\n \n\n   \n  At first, Khanna says, he took up the Epstein files cause because it was another way of sticking it to the elite class, the ones he travels the country talking about under his “economic patriotism” umbrella for shipping out their jobs and selling out their communities. But he was changed by what he calls the “emotionally horrific” meetings with survivors who started to come through his office — the guilt of having recruited friends, the trauma of being coerced, the women breaking down about how they’ve blocked memories of their own rapes and wanting the records of what happened so they can at least reclaim their own experiences.\n \n\n   \n  He should have listened sooner, he said Tuesday. He shouldn’t have let it slide when he says he brought up releasing the Epstein files with former Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democrat and House Oversight chair who died in 2019. He shouldn’t have waited until Trump’s backing off his promise to release them got him going in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  “Had I met the survivors in 2019 or 2020,” Khanna told CNN. “I would have been more vocal in the Biden administration. I think it is a fair point that all of us should have been more vocal earlier.”\n \n\n   \n  Khanna’s father taught him to be stoic, he said, so tears don’t tend to flow, but the anger does. This was insidious, he felt, “a rottenness in our civilization that allowed this to happen — like, how are we allowing these people to get away with this stuff?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This wasn’t about billionaires rigging the system, Khanna started to say. Men so rich and powerful and interconnected that they had means and the gall for a “rape island” and then to try to intimidate away any consequences represented something more: This, he argues, was about “the Epstein class.”\n \n\n   \n    A ‘proof of concept’\n \n\n   \n  Khanna doesn’t know if he’ll be invited to the bill signing Trump is now promising. He hasn’t talked to the president since January 6, 2021, not that their relationship was ever much more than hellos at first-term bill signings and one chat in the Oval Office about a new term-limits law. He thinks Trump won’t be able to wiggle out of his promise, or of complying, and believes there are too many survivors’ lawyers and former Justice officials who’ve seen the files to know if they get selectively scrubbed.\n \n\n   \n  Khanna is already talking to Greene about joining together to try to ban private equity firms from buying up single-family homes. He wonders if he can get a few Republicans to extend Medicare to people starting at 55, even though he still favors Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All. Cutting defense budgets seems to have some crossover appeal. Maybe they can come up with a billionaire’s tax that they’ll say is all about taking on the Epstein class.\n \n\n   \n  “My point is, if your goal is just, ‘How do Democrats win,’ maybe anti-Trump is enough for a moment. If your goal is, ‘How do we build an enduring majority, which is what progressive Democrats like me want to do?’ This is absolutely essential,” Khanna said. “This is a proof of concept that we need to actually figure out how we bring disaffected MAGA voters into our coalition, that we need to focus much more on railing against a system that has screwed Americans and offering a hopeful message about how we help them, more than just meme-ing against Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/trump-epstein-files-release-house-senate-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-05:00","title":"A Washington humiliation leaves Trump more politically exposed on Epstein than ever before","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan effort in the U.S. House and Senate has passed a bill requiring the Justice Department to release files related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with only one vote against it.

Only in a much more vulnerable political position.\n \n\n   \n  And they have unappetizing political choices at a moment when Trump’s presidency appears damaged,  his popularity is falling  and a crush of other intractable issues bogs down his White House. Speculation is growing about whether a president who many were recently warning was a dictator is close to becoming a lame duck.\n \n\n   \n    Vindication for victims\n \n\n   \n  The overwhelming House and Senate moves to release the Epstein files are a stunning triumph for Epstein’s victims after they became more visible earlier this summer. A president who believes he enjoys unfettered power and who disdains democracy was defeated by grassroots political campaigning in combination with a handful of courageous lawmakers from both parties.\n \n\n   \n  But Haley Robson, a survivor of Epstein’s abuse,  told CNN’s Erin Burnett  that Tuesday’s moves were not the end for women who long ago lost trust the government would protect them. “We have to be very honest with ourselves. … We do have a long road in front of us,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the pressure of the survivors’ campaign now threatens to bear down on Trump alone, after the House and the Senate moved with extraordinary speed to dump a radioactive political issue on the White House. Their pace might at least momentarily weigh on the mind of a president who was twice saved from conviction in an impeachment trial by pliant Republican senators.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most startling developments, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who’d long opposed the bill before Trump’s reversal, insisted the Senate must make changes to the bill. But senators ignored him and passed it up to the White House in an instant.\n \n\n   \n  Unless Trump and Bondi release the Epstein files immediately, the question that’s been haunting Trump for months will now become even more acute: What is he hiding?\n \n\n   \n  A bid by the DOJ to play for time — perhaps by arguing documents cannot be released because of ongoing investigations — might obstruct the hopes of survivors. But it might also mean Trump never escapes a storm that, judging by his  eruptions at reporters , is driving him to distraction. Another DOJ strategy could be to release countless pages of Epstein files but with details, names and other information blacked out to avoid incriminating people. But that would only prolong the controversy.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump in relation to his former friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in prison in 2019. Trump again branded the drama a Democratic “hoax” on Tuesday. But  multiple mentions of the president  in emails sent by Epstein recently released by Congress raise the possibility that he’s also referenced in documents held by the DOJ.\n \n\n   \n  One option for Bondi could be a vast document dump that casts suspicion on multiple prominent men who victims say maintained ties to Epstein in the hope that any minor mentions of Trump might be swept away in a deluge of scandal. But as president, he’s under the harshest spotlight and would be sure to attract the most interest, even though he has said he always knew Epstein was a creep.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, Trump has turned his DOJ into an arm of his political movement. So it would not be a surprise to see partial disclosures that do not satisfy his critics. But such is the intrigue around the drama, that there is no guarantee people would believe that he’d released everything. And conspiracists who’ve obsessed about the Epstein issue will never be satisfied.\n \n\n   \n  “The next question is, will Trump use some other maneuvers in an effort to deny the information to the public that’s required by the statute?” Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch said Tuesday. “We’ll see, but I don’t trust Trump on that.”\n \n\n   \n  Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, who broke with Trump to force through the bill demanding the release of the Epstein files, warned after the vote that he would act if there was an attempt to thwart disclosure of the Epstein evidence. As a last resort, he said, he might read aloud the names of alleged associates of the accused sex trafficker in the House. But he added that was only “if we hit all of the walls — but so far, we’re making it through the walls and over the walls, and we’re getting this done.”\n \n\n   \n    What wider damage has Trump sustained?\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the difficulty of next steps for Trump, there are the questions of how much political damage he’s suffered in recent days, both within his own party and personal power base and in the country more broadly.\n \n\n   \n  Ever since returning to the White House, Trump has wielded massive power through dominance, or at least the perception that he’s all-powerful. He never followed his party; it followed him. But the myth of total power was shattered on Sunday night when he reversed his adamant position that the House should block the attempt to release the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  The flip-flop was an attempt to defuse a looming political loss. But if his myth of omnipotence frays, it’s likely only to encourage further challenges to his authority. Of course, Trump’s instinct might be to lash out with constitutionally questionable conduct.\n \n\n   \n  This is an unusual moment for Trump. Could it presage a new phase of his presidency where the GOP does not move in lockstep on his orders? Or is the Epstein issue — which, at least to begin with, was disproportionately important to the conservative base — a one-off?\n \n\n   \n  One test might come soon for Trump over whether GOP lawmakers revolt over another matter: the expiration of enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which triggered the government shutdown. Some GOP lawmakers want to compromise with Democrats on the issue, but  the president reiterated  on Tuesday that he opposed any solution that sends more money to insurance firms.\n \n\n   \n  The US political calendar is relentless. And following larger-than-expected victories by Democrats in governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey this month, Republicans are wary about midterm elections next year. And onetime Trump ally  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s  recent attacks on Trump’s globetrotting and lack of empathy over high prices suggest that frustration with him  cuts deeper than Epstein alone .\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump is a survivor, and not just of two assassination attempts. He pulled off the greatest political comeback in history in 2024 despite a criminal conviction and after leaving power in disgrace in 2021 after refusing to accept the results of an election. No modern president has ever had such an unshakable connection with his base.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump’s most potent political strategy has been to claim he’s been persecuted. That’s not an approach that seems likely to work as he’s faced with victims of Epstein offering their testimony in public.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s rough patch\n \n\n   \n  Stunning developments on the Epstein files are not happening in isolation. It’s been a terrible few weeks for Trump. His polling numbers have slumped, especially over his handling of the economy. In another potential blow to his aura of invincibility, a federal judge this week  raised grave questions  about the viability of the DOJ’s prosecution of one of his enemies, former FBI Director James Comey.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court recently  seemed skeptical  about Trump’s tariff policy ahead of a seismic pending ruling on presidential authority. And a federal court on Tuesday  blocked Texas  from using new congressional maps drawn at the president’s behest to aid the GOP’s bid to hold on to its House majority in next year’s elections. (Texas plans to appeal to the US Supreme Court.)\n \n\n   \n  This leaves Trump needing a political rebound — a tough ask for a White House organized on the principle of the president’s infallibility and for a commander in chief who will be 80 on his next birthday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible Trump no longer controls his own political fate. Presidents often get overtaken by events in second terms — most recently George W. Bush, whose political capital was consumed by the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.\n \n\n   \n  And the symbolic might of Epstein’s long-overlooked victims has the look of a political force with unstoppable momentum.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death deprived many of his victims of justice.\n \n\n   \n  But on Tuesday, Jess Michaels, an Epstein survivor, spoke about watching House members add their votes to a 427-1 victory that she told CNN’s Jake Tapper represented a commitment not to “stay silent about powerful predators.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s no evidence of criminal conduct by Trump. But his handling of the Epstein crisis now threatens to consume his presidency.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/entertainment/nicki-minaj-speech-nigeria","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:36:00+00:00","title":"Nicki Minaj’s diplomatic moment, explained","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nicki Minaj addressed a special event in New York to highlight the persecution of Christians in Nigeria, drawing on her personal connections to the country and her fanbase.

addressed those gathered for a special event in New York on Tuesday meant to draw attention to what some are saying is the  plight of Christians in Nigeria .\n \n\n   \n  The rapper was introduced by President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz and began her remarks by expressing her nervousness and thanking both Waltz and Trump. She then said it was “an honor” to be present “to shine a spotlight on the deadly threats faced by thousands of Christians in Nigeria.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stand here as a proud New Yorker with a deep sense of gratitude that we live in a country where we can freely and safely worship God regardless of one’s creed, background, or politics,” she said. “No group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion, like I recently stated on social media. And we don’t have to share the same beliefs in order for us to respect each other.”\n \n\n   \n  The US president  recently sparked alarm in Nigeria  after he said he was considering military action there and would cease aid over what he claimed was the Nigerian government’s failure to protect Christians from a  “mass slaughter” by Islamist insurgents in the African nation.\n \n\n   \n  Experts have said the situation is  more nuanced than presented by the US president , with both Christians and Muslims being victims of violence by Islamic extremists.\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government also rejected Trump’s comments. “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Calling Nigeria “a beautiful nation with deep faith traditions,” Minaj noted in her address on Tuesday that some of her devoted fanbase, known as the Barbz, live there.\n \n\n   \n  “I am joined here today by peace builders, by faith leaders, by those who saw violence, saw intolerance, saw the threats clearly before us and chose not to look the other way,” Minaj said. “I am inspired by their work to build interfaith ties, to see the humanity across the lines which might divide us and to vie and to fight for security and liberty for all those who pray.”\n \n\n   \n  Waltz shared how Minaj’s invitation to speak at the US mission in New York came about in an interview on Fox News on Tuesday morning, saying she was asked to speak after expressing support of a Truth Social post from Trump in connection with the Nigeria issue. “To our astonishment, she accepted,” Waltz said. “She is reaching a whole other swath of people who may not follow these issues, and it’s going to be a great day.”\n \n\n   \n  Waltz  wrote earlier this week  that the rapper “is not only arguably the greatest female recording artist, but also a principled individual who refuses to remain silent in the face of injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m grateful she’s leveraging her massive platform to spotlight the atrocities against Christians in Nigeria, and I look forward to standing with her as we discuss the steps the President and his administration are taking to end the persecution of our Christian brothers and sisters,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Minaj  posted about her gratitude  for the invitation on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Ambassador, I am so grateful to be entrusted with an opportunity of this magnitude,” she wrote. “I do not take it for granted. It means more than you know.”\n \n\n   \n  She also referenced her fanbase.\n \n\n   \n  “The Barbz & I will never stand down in the face of injustice,” Minaj wrote. “We’ve been given our influence by God. There must be a bigger purpose.”\n \n\n   \n  Minaj, who recently made headlines because of an explosive online beef with fellow rapper Cardi B, has offered her admiration for Trump before.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, she  shared a screenshot on X  of Trump’s Truth Social post about Nigeria and his plans to act, writing, “Reading this gave me a deep sense of gratitude.”\n \n\n   \n  “We live in a country where we can freely worship God,” she wrote. “No group should ever face persecution for practicing their faith. We don’t have to share the same beliefs to respect one another.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House TikTok account this month joined the viral “Beez In The Trap x What’s Up?” remix, which combines the 1992 4 Non Blondes hit “What’s Up?” with Minaj’s 2012 “Beez In The Trap.”\n \n\n   \n   The White House video  featured scenes of Trump and first lady Melania Trump along with the remix.\n \n\n   \n  Minaj responded in the comments on the video by thanking the Trumps and saying, “This is pretty incredible.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/americas/venezuelan-propaganda-conflict-us-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00.000-04:00","title":"Venezuela’s Propaganda Machine Lashes Back with Jokes, Cartoons, and Sarcasm as US Pressure Ramps Up","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As U.S. pressure on Venezuela intensifies — including military deployments, threats of troop deployment, and covert actions — the Venezuelan regime has responded with a multifaceted propaganda campaign.

machine lashes back with jokes, cartoons and sarcasm as US pressure ramps up \n       \n  By Max Saltman, Isa Cardona, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s…not Superman?\n \n\n   \n  No, it’s Super Mustache, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro’s cartoon alter-ego, here to save the South American country from peril. \n \n\n   \n  “ Super Mustache ,” which has aired on Venezuelan state TV since 2021, is just one piece of the country’s propaganda push as  US warships amass  near the Venezuelan coast and US President Donald Trump  muses  about sending troops to depose Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  In  a September episode  of “Super Mustache,” aired shortly after Trump began his campaign of airstrikes on alleged drug boats off the Venezuelan coast, the cartoon superhero doffed his usual costume in favor of a military uniform, wielding a  sheathed sword  and declaring that Venezuela doesn’t have a “warmongering culture.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet despite Super Mustache’s new look, the Venezuelan government has sent mixed messages since tensions increased with the US, simultaneously urging citizens to prepare for action while insisting that everything is fine.\n \n\n   \n  The dissonance between the gravity of the crisis in the Caribbean and the regime’s messaging is visible on the streets of Caracas. Unlike in previous nationwide campaigns, CNN teams in Venezuela have not seen any billboards, banners, murals, or graffiti in the national capital calling for support for the regime’s war footing, even in neighborhoods considered government strongholds.\n \n\n   \n     Different strategies \n \n\n   \n  Maduro, who prior to August was more commonly seen in enclosed spaces, has been making speeches and public appearances almost daily since tensions began to rise with the United States, often seen surrounded by a significant security detail, according to Venezuelan researcher and journalist Andrés Cañizález.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro hasn’t taken on the job of projecting Venezuela’s military might in the face of Trump’s threats. He has instead portrayed himself as a peacemaker, even  singing John Lennon’s song “Imagine”  at a public event, urging Trump to come to the table for talks face-to-face. As he waded through the crowd at a rally on November 13, Maduro  told  CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon that the US should unite with Venezuela for peace in the Americas.\n \n\n   \n  Cañizález believes the Maduro government’s communication strategy has gone through different stages: initially, tensions with the US were downplayed, but as the US military presence in the Caribbean increased, the discourse shifted “to a more threatening, more retaliatory tone.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro’s counterpoint in Venezuela’s propaganda machine is Diosdado Cabello, the interior minister and host of one of the country’s most popular talk shows on state TV – “ Con el Mazo Dando, ” Spanish for “Hitting it with a Club.” In a typical four-hour episode, Cabello meanders between attacking opposition politicians, telling jokes and promoting the government’s position.\n \n\n   \n  Chief among those positions is that US actions in the Caribbean have nothing to do with drugs, despite what the  Trump administration insists .\n \n\n   \n  “There are no tensions here between Venezuela and the United States. Here there is an aggression by the United States against Venezuela,” Cabello declared on his episode last week. “And the aggression has nothing to do with drugs, or terrorism, or criminal gangs, it has to do with taking control of Venezuela’s natural resources.”\n \n\n   \n  On every episode, the interior minister reads out criticisms of the Maduro government, usually from Republican politicians in the US, then responds with a recording of the late President Hugo Chavez daring the United States to try and invade Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Political scientist Javier Corrales, who often writes about Venezuelan politics, told CNN that Cabello has long cultivated an aggressive reputation as part of the regime’s old guard.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a bully,” Corrales said. “There is a certain aspect of Cabello that we recognize in other autocracies, the need to have somebody not just praising the president, but trashing the opposition - and Cabello is amazing.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Venezuela’s military has also posted numerous videos on social media showing soldiers preparing for war, usually set to dramatic music. Footage shows troops conducting shooting drills, anti-tank fortifications in Caracas, and militia members posing with weapons.\n \n\n   \n     Going easy on Trump \n \n\n   \n  Yet, in their different approaches, Maduro and Cabello share one feature: a reluctance to criticize Trump too harshly. Both men have a lot to say about US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n \n\n   \n  In Cabello’s telling, Rubio, whom the interior minister often calls “the Crazy Cuban,” is intent on leading a reluctant Trump to declare war on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “This move to seek a change of government in Venezuela isn’t even to satisfy the interests of…Trump or MAGA, but rather those of Rubio and the Cuban American mafia,” Cabello announced to his live studio audience during last week’s episode.\n \n\n   \n  Corrales explained that Rubio is a perfect foil for the Maduro regime, being perhaps the most prominent critic of Latin American leftism in the US government. The secretary’s Cuban heritage and Florida origins also provide fodder for Cabello, who often claims that Rubio is aiming to please an electorate of anti-communist Cuban exiles in Miami.\n \n\n   \n  Cañizález told CNN that while Trump might be criticized, Rubio is a useful “external enemy” for the regime’s most loyal supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio “is presented as the direct enemy of the revolution,” Cañizález said. “This tactic seeks to sow divisions in US domestic politics and reinforce the idea of a personalized external enemy, useful for uniting the Chavista base.”\n \n\n   \n  Even after Trump ordered strikes on alleged drug boats directly off the Venezuelan coast in September, Cabello claimed in his show on September 3   that Rubio is “leading Trump to the slaughter, because Rubio is trying to fracture Trump’s MAGA base and…sell himself as a new hawk within the Republican Party.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the US State Department about Cabello’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  Even   though Cabello often talks about preparing for all scenarios, including possible military conflict, he occasionally downplays Trump’s announced actions against Venezuela. Shortly after Trump publicly authorized the CIA to conduct covert actions in the country, Cabello mocked as ridiculous the idea that the CIA had ever been inactive in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, (the CIA) has been formally authorized to act,” Cabello said sarcastically. “It never acted here before.”\n \n\n   \n  Herein lies the dilemma for Venezuela’s leadership: mobilizing support against external enemies while avoiding the panic of a country under siege. If worse comes to pass, will Super Mustache unsheathe his sword?\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/ntsb-bridge-recommendation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00-05:00","title":"How the NTSB is trying to prevent another major bridge collapse","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued 17 safety recommendations following the 2024 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, caused by a mislabeled wire on the cargo vessel Dali that led to a power failure and loss of control.

How the NTSB is trying to prevent another major bridge collapse \n       \n  By Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore could be repeated across the country if recommendations aren’t followed, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The board issued 17 safety recommendations this week to prevent an accident like the one last year, where the 213-million-pound cargo vessel Dali lost engine and electrical power as it was leaving the port and struck a pillar of the Key Bridge causing it to collapse.\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB recommended Synergy Marine, the ship’s operator, use thermal imaging to find lose wires on its other vessels, make sure the right pumps are being used, and that engines won’t automatically shut down in situations like this crash.\n \n\n   \n  Other recommendations include new rules for wire labeling, a warning system for drivers crossing bridges in case of emergency, and better recoding systems to capture data on ships in case of a crash.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to see safety change, we need our recommendations implemented,” NTSB chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters after a nearly five hour public meeting. “That’s the next step. We’ve issued the safety recommendations now we need to make sure that they’re implemented, and so we will work diligently.”\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB held the public meeting Tuesday to determine the probable cause of the container ship Dali crashing into the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and its subsequent collapse, killing six people.\n \n\n   \n  The 984-feet long vessel operated in the container liner trade, carrying truck-sized boxes of cargo between Asia and the US East Coast. The bridge was owned and operated by the Maryland Transportation Authority and opened to traffic on March 23, 1977.\n \n\n   \n  The last time the bridge was inspected was in 2024 when it was given a satisfactory rating. Yet the Key Bridge had nearly 30 times the acceptable level of risk for critical bridges of collapse if it were hit, based on guidance established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the NTSB said. But no one knew that before the collapse, because the owner of the bridge, the Maryland Transportation Authority, never evaluated that risk.\n \n\n   \n  The agency says all of the blame for the bridge collapse is the fault of the ship.\n \n\n   \n  “The MDTA maintains that the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and the tragic loss of life were the sole fault of the DALI and the gross negligence of its owners and operators,” it said in a statement to CNN Tuesday.  “The Key Bridge was approved and permitted by the federal government and complied with those permits.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Synergy thanked the NTSB for its “professionalism and technical rigour” throughout this investigation and said it and Grace Ocean Investment Limited, the company that owns the ship, have cooperated fully with the board.\n \n\n   \n  “We note the Board’s findings, including its observations regarding the vulnerability of the Key Bridge’s main support pier, as well as the comments relating to aspects of the vessel’s electrical arrangements. These matters will be reviewed in detail with our technical teams, the vessel owner and counsel,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the NTSB recommended risk assessments also be conducted on 68 other bridges in 19 states spanning waterways frequented by cargo ships that, like the Key Bridge, were built before 1991 and do not have a current vulnerability assessment.\n \n\n   \n  Among those on the list are the Golden Gate Bridge in California; Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, George Washington and Verrazzano-Narrows bridges in New York City; the Walt Whitman and Benjamin Franklin bridges in Pennsylvania; the Sunshine Skyway in Florida and the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Homendy noted that despite its recommendations, some of those bridges still have not been evaluated for risk of collapse if a ship like the Dali were to hit them.\n \n\n   \n    One loose wire, among thousands\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB said Tuesday it believes the probable cause of the power outage that led to the crash was a label was put in the wrong place on a signal wire when the ship was built. That sticker, identifying the line, kept the wire from getting a good connection in a circuit breaker – which in turn ultimately caused the first blackout.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, according to Marcel Muse, the NTSB’s investigator in charge, the vessel lost steering, the ability to operate the bow thruster, key water pumps, and most of the vessel’s lighting and equipment essential for operations. That first outage lasted 58 seconds.\n \n\n   \n  There were thousands of wires on the Dali, and one loose wire would not have been easily found by the crew.\n \n\n   \n  “The Dali is almost 1,000 feet, and it’s as long as the Eiffel Tower,” Homendy said. “It’s high with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Locating a single wire that is loose among thousands of wires is like looking for a loose bolt in the Eiffel Tower.”\n \n\n   \n  The crew onboard the Dali quickly found the tripped breaker, the NTSB said. Power came back within 58 seconds, but restarting a key pump that would have provided fuel to generators had to be done manually, and that didn’t happen. When the generators ran out of gas in their lines, the result was a second blackout.\n \n\n   \n  “To restart it, you would have to go two levels down in near total darkness with a flashlight from the engine control deck to the purifier room on the fourth deck,” Homendy said.\n \n\n   \n  The pump the Dali was using was designed for maintenance and was not intended for use while the ship was underway, so there was no backup system.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of the second blackout, the Dali was just three ships’ lengths from the bridge and despite the pilots reacting properly, they couldn’t regain control in time to avoid hitting it, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  About 10 hours earlier, while the ship was still moored, it experienced two onboard blackouts, one caused by a crew error, according to the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Grace Ocean and Synergy reached  a settlement  with the Justice Department to pay nearly $102 million to resolve a civil claim alleging that the companies’ cost-cutting and negligence in the ship’s maintenance led to the disastrous collision.\n \n\n   \n  In its filing last month, the Justice Department said that the “tragedy was entirely avoidable,” pointing to alleged failures in the ship’s infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n    Black boxes didn’t give up information easily\n \n\n   \n  Investigators also encountered many issues extracting information from the vessel’s recorders, which are similar to black boxes on airplanes.\n \n\n   \n  Voyage data recorders, known as a VDRs, are electronic systems that continuously record navigational and location data, radar images, basic engine operations, alarm status, bridge audio recordings and VHF radio communications, according to the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Payne, an investigator in the NTSB’s vehicle recorder division, said during the investigation, the NTSB encountered several problems that made it hard to extract and use the data efficiently.\n \n\n   \n  “Key issues included unrecorded data during the vessel’s first underway blackout, the lack of recording of communications between the Dali’s bridge and the Dali’s engine room, the digitally destructive mixing of recorded bridge audio channels, inadequate VDR playback software, the inability to download the full data set on board the Dali, and the complex workflow for processing proprietary VDR data in the common formats,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n    Final report coming soon\n \n\n   \n  The final report on the incident will be revised and issued in several weeks and the 17 recommendations will be formally issued and finalized by the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a really big voice, and we’re not afraid to use it,” Homendy said. “While we don’t have enforcement power, certainly, we have had a lot of success with voluntary adoption of our recommendations. We’re usually at an 83% closure rate.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Michelle Watson contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/cloudflare-down-outage-cause","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00-05:00","title":"Why it feels like your favorite websites keep going down","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent technical outage at Cloudflare—a major web infrastructure provider—disrupted services including Spotify, ChatGPT, and President Donald Trump’s Truth Social, highlighting a growing trend of widespread internet outages.

keep going down \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:02 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Having problems with your favorite websites lately? It’s not just you.\n \n\n   \n  Web infrastructure provider Cloudflare experienced a disruption on Tuesday that temporarily impacted a swath of online services – from Spotify to ChatGPT and even President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform – marking the latest in a string of high-profile internet outages.\n \n\n   \n  An  Amazon Web Services issue  disrupted the daily routines of millions of people last month, in some cases preventing them from doing even simple tasks like ordering coffee or managing smart home appliances. Just days later,  Microsoft’s Azure service  was hit with an outage.\n \n\n   \n  According to experts, it’s a sign of the times – a combination of society’s  increased reliance on digital services , the consolidation of critical cloud infrastructure between just a few companies and the proclivity of people to complain about tech mishaps online.\n \n\n   \n  It also shows that no one, not even major tech companies, are immune to tech malfunctions.\n \n\n   \n  “It really almost doesn’t matter how well-situated the provider is in these cases, or even how sophisticated the IT organization and infrastructure is for a private business,” said Eileen Haggerty, area vice president of product and solutions marketing for IT and cybersecurity firm Netscout. Tech disruptions like these are “very, very common problems.”\n \n\n   \n    What happened at Cloudflare\n \n\n   \n  Cloudflare’s outage was the result of a technical issue, not a cyberattack or malicious behavior, the company said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The company said the outage was caused by a “configuration file” that was meant to manage “threat traffic.”\n \n\n   \n  “The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare’s services,” the statement said.   \n \n\n   \n  Dane Knecht, chief technology officer at Cloudflare, shared additional details  in a post on X  on Tuesday afternoon. In short: a routine configuration change caused a bug to crash, which “cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services.”\n \n\n   \n  “Work is already underway to make sure it does not happen again, but I know it caused real pain today,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The Amazon outage similarly  involved a bug , which kicked off when two automated systems tried to update the same data simultaneously.\n \n\n   \n  IT outages are relatively common, tech experts say.   Twenty years ago, it was typical   for IT services to down “all the time,” said Mike Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame and former computer scientist for the National Security Agency.\n \n\n   \n  “It would not be unusual to go a week at work having at least one outage of some IT service,” he said, noting that now everyone relies on the same large providers.\n \n\n   \n  The impacts can be widely felt when they happen at the major providers, such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google, that serve as the backbone of the web.   \n \n\n   \n  Issues submitted to Downdetector, a website that tracks user-reported problems with popular online platforms, surpassed 2.1 million on Tuesday, according to data provided to CNN by Downdetector parent company Ookla.\n \n\n   \n  Cloudflare says it handles 81 million HTTP requests – or when web browsers need certain data to trigger an action, such as loading a webpage – per second on average.\n \n\n   \n    Are there really more outages happening lately?\n \n\n   \n  That there have been three widespread outages in less than a month is a coincidence. But Haggerty acknowledged that it certainly feels like these outages are happening more often, mostly because of the scale of their impact.\n \n\n   \n  The number of service outages has “remained consistent,” but the “number of sites and applications dependent on these services has increased, making them more disruptive to users,” Angelique Medina, head of internet intelligence for Cisco ThousandEyes, told CNN in an emailed statement.\n \n\n   \n  Cisco’s network monitoring service has logged 12 major outages in 2025 so far, according to  a timeline published on its website , not counting Tuesday’s Cloudflare disruption.\n \n\n   \n  That compares to 23 in 2024, 13 in 2023 and 10 in 2022. A  sweeping Crowdstrike outage  upended businesses, flights and hospitals around the world in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  There are some common trends between outages that occurred in the first half of 2025,  according to Cisco . A string of outages were linked to systems accidentally spreading tech failures, systems that appeared to be functioning properly despite silent issues occurring and configuration changes that cascaded.\n \n\n   \n  While these trends aren’t new, Cisco’s blog post says it’s been “seeing more of these types of disruptions with more far-reaching consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’ll likely happen again.\n \n\n   \n  “They aren’t something you’d say, ‘Well, thank God that would never happen to us,’” said Haggerty. “All of these could actually happen to any business.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hadas Gold contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/epstein-survivors-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:11:00-20:12","title":"‘We have power together’: For Epstein survivors, a day of emotion and triumph","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A group of survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operations gathered in Washington, DC to demand transparency and accountability through the release of the Epstein files.

Every time someone new arrived, there was an eruption of hugs and cheerful greetings.\n \n\n   \n  The scene could have easily been a joyful reunion of old friends.\n \n\n   \n  But the group was made up of the  survivors of Jeffrey Epstein , forever bonded by their trauma and abuse at the hands of the convicted pedophile. The women had once again descended on Washington, DC, to hold a press conference and plead with lawmakers to  vote to release the Epstein files .\n \n\n   \n  Dani Bensky, who met Epstein when she was a young ballerina, said she had managed to get just a few hours of sleep the previous night. She had spent the evening with the family of the late Epstein victim  Virginia Giuffre , making the most out of the fact that they are rarely in the same place at the same time. It was past midnight when she realized she still hadn’t written out the remarks she would need to make at a press conference just hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “Who writes a speech at one o’clock in the morning the night before? Ai yai yai, rookie mistake on my part,” Bensky said lightheartedly after the press conference, as she quickly made her way to a meeting that was scheduled with a lawmaker. Her fellow survivors, walking alongside her, were quick to reassure her that she had done just fine.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the day, the women stayed close together much like this — there to offer each other pep talks and reminders to drink water and eat; quietly squeezing one another’s hands; and making sure nobody got lost in the maze of hallways on Capitol Hill as they hoped for good news.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Can we give you a hug?’\n \n\n   \n  In the late morning, the women found themselves consoling Republican Rep. Nancy Mace.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina congresswoman walked out into the foyer of her office in the Longworth building in tears. She has been ensnared in a legal battle of her own after  accusing her ex-fiancé  of crimes including physical assault, rape and sex trafficking — allegations he strongly denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ve given me hope that one day I might get justice,” Mace told the Epstein survivors. “It’s very raw for me.”\n \n\n   \n  “Can we give you a hug?” one woman jumped in to ask.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, I would love a hug,” Mace responded, which prompted several women to take turns embracing the lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  Mace was one of only four House Republicans to support a discharge petition to force a House vote on the Epstein files. When an Epstein survivor told the congresswoman that the group had been holding their breath and hoping Mace wouldn’t cave to political pressure and abandon her support for the bill, Mace responded: “Yeah, I ran out of fucks to give a long time ago.”\n \n\n   \n  “We rarely get this chance. This moment is historic,” she said. “Women never get this chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell abused her, told CNN it was impossible for her now to imagine going through this experience alone.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time a large group gathers, it completely changes the dynamic and the experience,” Farmer said. “It really does move us from feeling fearful to feeling like we are feared. We have power together.”\n \n\n   \n  Her sister, Maria, is one of the earliest known Epstein accusers. As Farmer made her way from meeting to meeting on Tuesday, more than once, she was on the phone, keeping her sister apprised of developments.\n \n\n   \n  At 2:43 p.m., the gavel came down in the House — the  Epstein bill had passed  on an overwhelming 427-1 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as she stepped out of the House gallery after passage, Farmer was back on her phone, calling Maria to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just incredible to hear her voice and to be able to tell her it passed and it happened and you were such a big part of it,” Annie said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It kills me that she’s not here’\n \n\n   \n  One Epstein victim was not present on Capitol Hill on Tuesday but her presence could be felt everywhere that the group of survivors went.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, died by suicide in August. In her  posthumously published memoir  released last month, she wrote about having been lent out to an endless stream of wealthy and powerful people. “I believed that I might die a sex slave,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, spoke at the survivors’ press conference and credited his sister for having helped to advance the fight for accountability and transparency, tears streamed down the faces of Giuffre’s fellow victims standing behind Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Sissy,” Roberts said. “You didn’t just make a small dent. You made a monumental impact, a resounding statement that echoed across the world. You built an unbreakable wall, a barrier that will protect future generations from the horrors of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  Bensky, who credits Giuffre for having shaped her own decision to go public with her Epstein story, said she has wondered what Giuffre would have made of this moment.\n \n\n   \n  “It kills me that she’s not here to see it,” Bensky said. “It’s so wrong that she’s just not here. It’s kind of devastating to think that we’re doing this without her.”\n \n\n   \n  Many of the other survivors wore brightly colored butterfly pins on their lapels on Tuesday in Giuffre’s memory. For Bensky and Farmer, their green and pink jeweled brooches were all the more meaningful because they were gifts given to them by Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia chose the symbol of the butterfly because of the metamorphosis and this real belief she had that there could be post-traumatic growth — that you could go through something like this and come out the other side and have so much to give and share,” Farmer told CNN. “And that’s what she did.”\n \n\n   \n  After the passage of the House’s Epstein bill, the women gathered in the early evening to hold a vigil honoring all of Epstein’s victims, including those who have passed. It was right around when Farmer was paying tribute to Giuffre that Bensky got a whisper in her ear: The Senate had decided to pass the Epstein bill immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the survivors had assumed that the bill’s path through the Senate — and to President Donald Trump’s desk — could be long and arduous and had been preparing for another major battle.\n \n\n   \n  “Words will never ever be able to describe this day,” Bensky said. “We just feel like we never have gotten the win, and we got the win. And that feels so good.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/americas/torres-del-paine-snowstorm-five-dead-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:10:00-05:00","title":"Five tourists killed by snowstorm in Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A severe snowstorm in Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park killed five international tourists—two Mexicans, two Germans, and one Briton—while four missing individuals were later found alive.

Then an 11th-hour court order gave hope to see his family again \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:26 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Saturday evening, Samantha Surovtsev squinted at her phone, blinking through tears as she rushed to order a set of Eastern European power adapters. Despite the 80-degree North Texas heat, she then drove to Old Navy and bought two bulky winter coats.\n \n\n   \n  When the adapters arrived Sunday, she tucked them into a suitcase alongside the coats and wool socks and drove everything to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Alvarado.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband,  Roman Surovtsev , was inside. The 41-year-old had been there for 109 days, after being unexpectedly detained during a routine check-in with ICE in August. Surovtsev had been convicted of armed carjacking when he was 19 and was released from prison in 2014 before a six-month stint in ICE custody. The run-in cost him his permanent resident status.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was swept up again in ICE detainment as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration, an effort stretching across the country from  Charlotte  to  Portland , fracturing families and communities.\n \n\n   \n  Since returning to office, Trump has implemented policies to deport undocumented migrants en masse. ICE agents have been  directed  to detain and arrest people at  work ,  courthouses,   churches and schools  as part of the administration’s  deportation push .\n \n\n   \n  Now the husband and father of two was a day away from boarding a deportation flight with dozens of other detainees to war-torn Ukraine, a country he hadn’t lived in since it was part of the Soviet Union.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Surovtsev’s case. In a Monday post on X, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Surovtsev a “criminal illegal alien” with “a history of violence,” citing carjacking and burglary charges alongside a number of other offenses of which he hasn’t been convicted.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday night, he used the center’s tablet to call his wife, family and in-laws to say what he believed were his final goodbyes. Immigration officials wouldn’t tell Surovtsev, his attorneys or Samantha when or where specifically he was being removed, citing security concerns, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  All they could do now was wait.\n \n\n   \n  Monday passed in agonizing quiet. Samantha sat by the phone for hours, waiting for confirmation that the worst had happened, that Surovtsev had been officially deported.\n \n\n   \n  His immigration attorney finally called at 3:29 p.m. She stepped outside, away from the sounds of her young daughters playing inside.\n \n\n   \n  “The stay has been granted,” the attorney told her. The flight full of detainees would still leave for Ukraine, but he wouldn’t be on it.\n \n\n   \n    ‘God’s timing is perfect’\n \n\n   \n  Roman Surovtsev was born in the former Soviet Union in 1984 and fled to the US legally with his mother and two siblings when he was 4 years old. Although they found relief from Soviet rule in their new country, he grew up in poverty and instability.\n \n\n   \n  In 2003, at 19 years old, Surovtsev began serving a 13-year sentence after helping some friends commit an armed carjacking of a motorcycle in California. In prison, he was baptized, a turning point that transformed him, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  He met Samantha in 2017 while jet skiing with mutual friends in Orange County, and the two eventually married, bought a home outside Dallas, launched a painting business and started a family. Surovtsev has never violated the terms of his supervision order, his lawyers wrote in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  When Samantha hung up with the attorney on Monday, her heart racing, she rang the tablet at the detention center.\n \n\n   \n  “Are you listening?” she asked Surovtsev when he picked up. “They issued the stay, and they’re reopening your case.”\n \n\n   \n  His lawyers thought it would take two to three months to hear from a judge about the motion to reopen his case, which they filed November 4.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev wept. “God’s timing is perfect,” he told her.\n \n\n   \n  “We had accepted that Roman would be on that plane, and I was thinking about what our lives are going to look like and if we could ever get to him again,” Samantha said. “And suddenly, it’s all reversed, because there’s still hope.”\n \n\n   \n  She spent the rest of the day telling family and friends the news.\n \n\n   \n  That night, as Samantha tucked their daughters into bed, her 5-year-old asked if they could call dad. For months, Samantha had told the girls that their father was simply “at work.”\n \n\n   \n  When he picked up the tablet, the two talked excitedly about all the things they planned to do when Surovtsev came home. He promised her he would build a massive Barbie dollhouse to go into the attic playroom he made for his girls.\n \n\n   \n  His daughter squealed with excitement.\n \n\n   \n    Decades of legal battles, time served and reform led to the stay\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was released early on good behavior in 2014 when an immigration court judge ordered him to be deported. He lost his green card, and he was placed into ICE custody, but the agency ran into trouble removing him from the country.\n \n\n   \n  Having been born in the former Soviet Union, the Russian Consulate told the US government in early 2015 it had no records of Surovtsev, his lawyers wrote in court filings. The Ukrainian government also said at the time it couldn’t confirm his citizenship given that Surovtsev was from a region of Ukraine that’s at war and not readily reachable, and therefore could not issue him Ukrainian travel documents.\n \n\n   \n  Subsequently, Surovtsev was released from ICE custody in May 2015 on an order of supervision without his green card but with an employment authorization document, a work permit, and was required to wear an ankle monitor for six months. He checked in with ICE every other week before his visits became quarterly, then annual.\n \n\n   \n  For years, he checked in at the kiosk of the Dallas ICE office, confirming details like his address and any travel plans in between starting his own business and building a family.\n \n\n   \n  His unexpected detainment during a routine check-in on August 1 mobilized Samantha, who rallied a team of lawyers to represent him.\n \n\n   \n  His counsel was able to successfully vacate Surovtsev’s carjacking charge, essentially wiping it from his record, on the grounds that he received ineffective counsel back in 2014, Surovtsev’s immigration lawyer Jennifer Rozdzielski said. This empowered his attorneys to file a motion earlier this month to reopen his old criminal case in hopes of getting it dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  In the 11th hour on Monday, just before he was to board the deportation flight bound for Ukraine, a court in California agreed to hear his case and ordered a stay of his removal, barring the US government from deporting him.\n \n\n   \n  “Respondent has demonstrated new, material evidence to warrant reopening of these proceedings,” the order, reviewed by CNN, reads. “His convictions were vacated pursuant to California Penal Code 1473.7(a)(1), specifically due to constitutional defects in the underlying criminal proceedings, so Respondent met his ‘heavy burden’ to show that his evidence ‘would likely change the result’ in his case.”\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev will remain in detention while the court proceedings play out.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re just thankful that plane took off without him, and that the judge ruled the way she did, because all we wanted was time for our case to be heard. And we got it,” Samantha said.\n \n\n   \n  But Surovtsev’s team has acknowledged that the fight isn’t over.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s next is making sure that not a single other Ukrainian who’s in detention is sent back to that country,” said Eric Lee, one of Surovtsev’s attorneys.\n \n\n   \n    The flight carrying dozens of detainees still took off for Ukraine, attorneys said\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev’s relief while his court proceedings play out comes at a bittersweet moment for his legal team and other families. Some deportees boarded Monday’s flight and are now in Ukraine, his attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n  “However many people were ultimately successfully deported to Ukraine are probably fighting for their lives right now,” said Lee. “We’re glad at least one person was prevented from going on that flight, but we’re very upset about all the others and very, very sorry for their families.”\n \n\n   \n  Samantha has been in contact with several other families with loved ones who were deported on Monday’s flight. None of them have been able to get ahold of them yet, she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on the flight to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  One family is tracking their deportee’s phone, with an app showing it on the move inside Ukraine, Samantha said. But he’s not answering their calls, and they’re not sure if he still has his phone.\n \n\n   \n  Another detainee has a background similar to Surovtsev – a USSR child refugee who got into trouble as a teenager, served his sentence and moved through adulthood with a supervision order from ICE, his attorney Ann Peters said. Her client, who also narrowly missed being deported Monday, is the primary caretaker of his brother, a paralyzed Marine Corps veteran.\n \n\n   \n  As Samantha and other detainees’ families sit in legal limbo during what feels like an endless pursuit to see their loved ones again, Samantha said the Bible verse Romans 8:31 is keeping her warm.\n \n\n   \n  “If God is for us, who can be against us?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/americas/brazil-supreme-court-sentences-military-officials-lula-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:43:00-05:00","title":"Brazil’s Supreme Court sentences military officials for planning to kill Lula","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brazil’s Supreme Court has sentenced nine high-ranking military officials and one federal police officer to prison terms ranging from 1 year and 11 months to 24 years for their roles in a plot to kill President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, as part of a broader effort to overthrow the democratic government.

\n   \n  A panel of Brazilian Supreme Court justices sentenced high-ranking military officials and a federal police officer to up to 24 years in prison on Tuesday after finding them guilty of attempting a coup and plotting to kill President  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  and other authorities.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the Supreme Court panel sentenced former President  Jair Bolsonaro  to 27 years and three months in prison for leading the criminal organization that sought to overturn the 2022 election, when Lula defeated Bolsonaro. At the time, the panel also sentenced other close allies who justices said formed part of the “core group.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the panel convicted those accused of planning the criminal organization’s violent actions, which included a plot to kill Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice  Alexandre de Moraes .\n \n\n   \n  Of the 10 defendants forming part of this group, nine are high-ranking military officers and one a member of the federal police.\n \n\n   \n  The four-justice panel unanimously convicted nine of them, acquitting a retired general due to insufficient evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Seven of them were convicted of attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, attempted coup, participation in an armed criminal organization, aggravated damage and deterioration of listed heritage.\n \n\n   \n  Two were convicted of the less serious offences of criminal association and public incitement of animosity between the Armed Forces and constitutional authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Sentences ranged from 1 year and 11 months to 24 years, with four defendants handed down time behind bars of more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  “Brazil, once again, due to the irresponsibility and lack of patriotism of some, flirted with and almost fell into a chasm of institutional darkness,” Justice Flávio Dino said as he cast his vote, in a reference to Brazil’s military dictatorship (1964-1985).\n \n\n   \n  “It wasn’t just a walk in the park. It was a coup that was going to arrest and kill people, revoke the constitution, citizenship and the free press. And these are not conjectures: it was written in the planning seized from these various public agents,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet pointed to evidence that a federal police officer infiltrated the security team of the then president-elect to enable the group’s violent plans.\n \n\n   \n  The plan didn’t advance due to the Army commander’s lack of support, according to Moraes, who is overseeing the sprawling coup case.\n \n\n   \n  Those convicted will only start serving time once appeals are exhausted.\n \n\n   \n  That’s also the case for Bolsonaro, who has been under house arrest since August.\n \n\n   \n  The panel recently rejected an appeal filed by the former president’s legal team, but another one could be submitted this week.\n \n\n   \n  Bolsonaro’s trial made global headlines.

He expresses his admiration for authoritarians almost as often.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday showed how intertwined those two instincts really are.\n \n\n   \n  Trump repeatedly objected to press questions during an Oval Office photo op with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, whose country does not have a free press.\n \n\n   \n  He lashed out at an ABC correspondent, Mary Bruce, after she invoked the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.\n \n\n   \n  The president said his ally, Brendan Carr, the chairman of the FCC, should “look at” punishing ABC over its news coverage.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the license should be taken away from ABC because your news is so fake and it’s so wrong,” he asserted.\n \n\n   \n  Trump misstated how FCC licenses actually work, but his message was clear: He’d like his government to retaliate the way a dictator would.\n \n\n   \n  The president also called Bruce “insubordinate,” a word he rarely ever uses, while sitting next to the son of the Saudi king.\n \n\n   \n  According to  Reporters Without Borders , which tracks press freedom all around the world, “independent media are non-existent in Saudi Arabia, and Saudi journalists live under heavy surveillance, even when abroad.”\n \n\n   \n  “Despite societal reforms, journalists are still being detained and media outlets operate under strict state control,” the organization says.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has no such control over the American media, but he acts like he wants to have it.\n \n\n   \n  In his comments on Tuesday, Trump was “reflecting his belief that the press is there to be subservient to him, to shut up when he demands they shut up when he finds the question embarrassing,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now, a non-profit founded by Khashoggi in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s the multi-part question from Bruce that triggered the tense exchange:\n \n\n   \n  “Is it appropriate, Mr. President, for your family to be doing business in Saudi Arabia while you’re president? Is that a conflict of interest? And, your royal highness, the US intelligence (community) concluded you orchestrated the brutal murder of a journalist. 9/11 families are furious that you are here in the Oval Office. Why should Americans trust you? And the same to you, Mr. President.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Bruce could complete the question, Trump repeatedly asked, “Who are you with?”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m with ABC News, sir,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “Fake news,” Trump claimed, deriding one of the best-known news brands in America as “one of the worst in the business.”\n \n\n   \n  “But the question is important, sir,” Bruce said, unfazed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went on to claim that he has “nothing to do with the family business,” then spoke dismissively about Khashoggi, calling the dissident journalist “ extremely controversial .”\n \n\n   \n  Prince bin Salman said Khashoggi’s murder has “been painful for us in Saudi Arabia” and defended the Saudi investigation into the crime.\n \n\n   \n  Karen Attiah, who edited Khashoggi’s columns for The Washington Post, wrote on Bluesky that Trump’s comments about the slain journalist were “absolutely vile.”\n \n\n   \n  Minutes later, when Bruce asked an unrelated question about “the Epstein files,” Trump berated her for having an unpleasant “attitude.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the way you ask these questions,” he said. Circling back to the Khashoggi question for the prince, he said, “You start off with a man who is highly respected, asking him a horrible, insubordinate, and just a terrible question. And you could even ask that same question nicely.”\n \n\n   \n  Then he tore into ABC, calling it a “crappy company,” and raising the specter of government retaliation.\n \n\n   \n  The FCC regulates the licenses of local TV and radio stations nationwide, including those owned by ABC. But the national network is not licensed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly spoken of wanting to revoke licenses, which would break with decades of precedent and likely spark lengthy legal battles.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on X, “Trump again directs the FCC to rescind a broadcast license over a reporter’s question. Thin-skinned. Weak. Un-American. Authoritarian.”\n \n\n   \n  ABC had no comment about his latest threat. But some of Bruce’s colleagues at ABC and fellow members of the White House press corps cheered her persistence in posts on social media.\n \n\n   \n  The National Press Club warned in a statement that Trump’s minimizing of Khashoggi’s murder can have “real-world consequences” because such statements “can embolden those who wish to silence reporters, and they can undermine the essential principle that journalists must be able to work without fear of violence or retribution.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/human-rights-trump-khashoggi-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s Flippant Comments on Human Rights and Jamal Khashoggi’s Murder Raise Concerns","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details how, despite U.S. intelligence and bipartisan condemnation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, President Donald Trump consistently minimized or dismissed the atrocity.

Trump administration concluded  that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the gruesome murder of a US resident and journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP-led Senate  voted unanimously to condemn  the crown prince. One Republican senator remarked at the time that if the matter went before a jury, the crown prince “would be convicted in 30 minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear that he simply doesn’t care about Khashoggi’s killing all that much. But even by his standards, Trump’s  comments alongside the crown prince  on Tuesday were stunning.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went from downplaying Khashoggi’s murder to vouching for the crown prince (who has denied personal involvement).\n \n\n   \n  While Trump  previously suggested  we’d never know for sure whether the crown prince were guilty, this time he said affirmatively that Prince bin Salman “knew nothing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  While the president previously gestured suggestively at conservative talking points about Khashoggi’s past associations with Islamist movements (a past that the evidence shows  Khashoggi abandoned ), this time Trump all but said the journalist had it coming. He called Khashoggi “extremely controversial,” and said, “Whether you liked him or didn’t like him, things happen” — as if dismembering someone with a bone saw were just a fluke.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most strikingly, Trump rebuked a reporter for even asking about this in the crown prince’s presence.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Khashoggi’s widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, responded to Trump’s comments by saying the journalist’s past was “not justification to murder him.”\n \n\n   \n  “Jamal was a good, transparent and brave man,” she added in comments to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is hardly the first president to bow to the strategic and geopolitical importance of keeping good relations with Saudi Arabia;  presidents of both parties  have offered tough talk about the Saudis on the campaign trail and then adjusted course once in office.\n \n\n   \n  But what sets Trump apart is his almost complete lack of interest in even  pretending  that he’s factoring human rights into that equation. In fact, he opened his meeting with the crown prince on Tuesday by saying, “What he’s done is incredible, in terms of human rights and everything else.”\n \n\n   \n  And this has been a constant throughout Trump’s decade in the national spotlight.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some of his more remarkable comments on human rights and alleged human rights abusers, mostly from his first term.\n \n\n   \n    2017: Likening US conduct to Vladimir Putin’s political assassinations\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Trump first took office, then-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly posited to him that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “a killer.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of killers,” Trump  said . “You think our country’s so innocent?”\n \n\n   \n  When Russia’s war in Ukraine began in 2022, Trump initially  praised Putin’s “genius” and “savvy”  in launching the unprovoked invasion, even as Western leaders roundly condemned it. (Trump has since said he’s “very disappointed” in the Russian leader amid the ongoing war.)\n \n\n   \n    2018: Making similar comments about North Korea’s Kim Jong Un\n \n\n   \n  When another Fox host noted that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un executed lots of people, Trump responded: “He’s a tough guy.”\n \n\n   \n  When pressed again on Kim  doing “some really bad things,”  Trump  added : “Yeah, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I mean, I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done. Now look, with all of that being said, the answer is yes.”\n \n\n   \n    2016: Praising Saddam Hussein for killing alleged terrorists without due process\n \n\n   \n  “He was a bad guy — really bad guy,” Trump, then a presidential candidate,  said  of late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. “But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn’t read them the rights. They didn’t talk. They were terrorists — over.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Hussein killed lots of people — not just alleged terrorists — without due process. A  2002 State Department report  said he did so “because he believes that their political beliefs, faith, ethnic background, family members or acquaintances are a threat to his power.”\n \n\n   \n    2017: Praising Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for his drug war\n \n\n   \n  Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war featured large numbers of extrajudicial killings and was widely condemned by human rights groups.\n \n\n   \n  And not only did Trump not condemn that; he at one point during his first term praised Duterte.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” Trump told Duterte during an April 29, 2017, phone call,  according to a transcript  whose basic contents were confirmed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump added: “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing, and I just wanted to call and tell you that.”\n \n\n   \n  (A senior US official said at the time that Trump was merely acknowledging the US is combating its own drug problem, not condoning violence and human rights violations.)\n \n\n   \n    2019: Allegedly encouraging China’s Uyghur detention camps\n \n\n   \n  Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton in his 2020 book recounted a scene from a G20 summit. In it, Trump and Chinese leader  Xi Jinping discussed the Chinese government’s detention camps for Uyghur Muslims in western China.\n \n\n   \n  “With only interpreters present, Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do,” Bolton  wrote . “The National Security Council’s top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China.”\n \n\n   \n  Then-US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  denied the account , calling it “absolutely untrue” and “completely crazy.”\n \n\n   \n    2025: Praising Belarus’ president\n \n\n   \n  Trump  in a social media post  in August referred to the “highly respected President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko.”\n \n\n   \n  Lukashenko has long been accused of  egregious human rights abuses  and even  crimes against humanity . He has often been called  Europe’s last dictator  by foreign policy watchers.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, Trump’s own State Department in 2020  declined to recognize Lukashenko  as the legitimate president of Belarus, citing a rigged election.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/science/semiyarka-bronze-age-eurasia-steppe","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00-05:00","title":"Archaeologists May Have Uncovered a Bronze Age Metropolis in Kazakhstan’s Steppe","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of a large Bronze Age settlement in Kazakhstan’s steppe, known as Semiyarka or 'The City of Seven Ravines,' which may have functioned as a center of governance, trade, and tin bronze production around 1600 BC.

\nUpdated: \n        6:50 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Upon the open grasslands of what is now Kazakhstan, there once stood a  Bronze Age  settlement that may have served as a center of exchange and power around 1600 BC.\n \n\n   \n  The settlement — called Semiyarka and nicknamed “The City of Seven Ravines” for its location overlooking a network of valleys — was first discovered in the early 2000s, but it wasn’t until an international group of archaeologists surveyed the area starting in 2018 that its impressive size and potential importance within the Eurasian Steppe came to light. What the team discovered was an expansive area that was once replete with houses, a central monumental building, which may have been used for rituals or governance, and possibly even tin bronze metal production facilities.\n \n\n   \n  Their findings, published  Monday in the journal Antiquity , are just the beginning, the study authors said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very exciting, because it’s such a rare find to have tin bronze production in this area,” said lead author Miljana Radivojević, an associate professor in archaeological science at University College London, UK. “We know we have hundreds of thousands of tin bronze artifacts from the Bronze Age in the  Eurasian steppe  and we have only one published site on tin bronze production. And this is the second one.” Tin bronze allowed for sturdier tools and other materials to be made, Radivojević added.\n \n\n   \n  As the team now embarks on excavating the area, they say the continued discoveries of Semiyarka are transforming what we know about urban life in prehistoric Eurasia.\n \n\n   \n  “We just don’t have anything like this at all,” said study coauthor Dan Lawrence, a professor of archaeology at Durham University in the UK. There are hardly settlements of any kind recovered in the steppe, he added. “What you get across this landscape, we associate with mobile pastoral groups, and we think maybe they were in tents or yurts. What we’ve got here is something that’s very clearly quite different.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanning 140  hectares  (about 346 acres) above the Irtysh River valley, the large size and strategic location of the settlement may indicate that the Bronze Age steppe had sophisticated cities similar to those located in more urban areas of the world at the time, Lawrence added.\n \n\n   \n    Surveying a long-lost city\n \n\n   \n  To find the borders of the settlement, Lawrence led the team in a survey project that looked at satellite imagery and analyzed every 50-meter square across the site. They only examined the surface, finding pottery fragments, including at least 114 ceramic vessels, and other artifacts scattered across the settlement.\n \n\n   \n  The team also used imagery from  Corona spy photography  dating to the 1960s, to identify where the land had been disturbed during the last several decades, as well as magnetometry, a noninvasive survey technique that allowed the archaeologists to see buried structures and metal objects without having to excavate.\n \n\n   \n  The next step, excavations, are underway now, and Radivojević says more discoveries have already been made. “What has been published is that we had indications — we looked at the materials that were crucibles and slags and artifacts, and we could just connect them and say, well, these are the bronzes,” she said. “But then as we go, we have more discoveries, so I was more confident in talking about, say, a larger-scale production of metallurgy on the site.”\n \n\n   \n  But not everyone agrees on whether Semiyarka resembled a major city. “The results, at least those presented in the article, would suggest a strong ‘NO’ to that question, especially given the low-density pottery sherd scatter on the surface and seemingly equally low-density evidence for metallurgy,” James Johnson, an archaeologist and assistant instructional professor in anthropology at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, said in an email. Johnson, who has studied Bronze and Iron Age pastoralist societies of the Eurasian steppe, was not involved with the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “Cities are spatial and demographic entities that usually represent the complex interplay of the built environment, population density and sprawl, and material culture (as well as numerous other sociological factors),” he added. The low number of ceramic artifacts found could indicate a limited use of pottery, common among prehistoric steppe societies, and that pottery might not be “the best material culture category to connect with population density usually associated with urban populations.”\n \n\n   \n  Further research into the middens, heaps of remains that provide a glimpse into past human life, as well as surface collections beyond the settlement would help archaeologists better understand settlement patterns, Johnson said.\n \n\n   \n  While Lawrence agrees that there isn’t enough evidence to conclude that the settlement was a major city, “I also think we can’t say it is a strong no for the same reasons,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The relatively small amount of pottery remains can be attributed to the fact that the ground is undisturbed and compacted by several feet of snow every winter; many artifacts could still be underground, Lawrence noted.\n \n\n   \n  He continued: “Different things happen in urban settlements than in the rural ones. For example, in modern times you need to go to a city to get heavy industry, fancy shops or a seat of political power. I think we can say that Semiyarka is a city in the sense that it is very different from surrounding settlements and provides just those kinds of urban services.”\n \n\n   \n  Semiyarka could be evidence that the region found a balance between the typical pastoralist mobile sites and other important societal elements, such as tin bronze production, one of the most important technologies of the time, said Michael Frachetti, a professor of archaeology at Washington University in St. Louis.\n \n\n   \n  “Although the archaeological scale and function of these central places is still unfolding, the results so far open many questions about the organizational choices steppe societies made in terms of metallurgy, political organization, and economic connectivity at both local and regional scales,” Frachetti said in an email. Frachetti, who specializes in pastoralism in the Bronze Age, was also not involved with the study.\n \n\n   \n    In search of answers\n \n\n   \n  There is not a lot of evidence of settlements in the Eurasia steppe during the Bronze Age; most sites were mobile, and did not leave behind a lot of archaeological evidence, Lawrence said. However, the grasslands haven’t received much archaeological attention, he added, and it’s possible there are many settlements still left to be uncovered\n \n\n   \n  With future research, the study authors said they hope to find further evidence of Semiyarka’s potentially powerful role during the Bronze Age, as well as insight into urban life and metal production within the steppe.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, their research has revealed the outlines of at least 15 structures throughout the settlement, with a few showing evidence of being houses with internal rooms.\n \n\n   \n  How many people lived there? How long did the settlement survive? What connections did the city have to other areas? Lawrence hopes that the excavation process will turn up answers.\n \n\n   \n  “This site is super interesting because it just breaks from all the things that we thought we knew about Central Asia up to this point,” Lawrence said. “And so understanding how that got there, why that got there, and then how it connects to these much larger stories is really interesting, and it’s not something we can answer yet, but now we know the site’s there, we can start to develop a program to try and understand what it all means.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/khashoggi-murder-trump-bin-saudi-crown-prince","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00-05:00","title":"Trump claims slain journalist Khashoggi was ‘extremely controversial,’ defends Saudi crown prince","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a high-profile visit to the White House in November 2025, President Donald Trump dismissed questions about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, claiming the man was 'extremely controversial' and asserting that the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had no involvement.

was ‘extremely controversial,’ defends Saudi crown prince \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:51 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Tuesday angrily dismissed a question about the 2018 murder of  Jamal Khashoggi , claiming the Saudi dissident journalist was “extremely controversial” and insisting the subject was only raised during his meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to embarrass his visitor.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial. A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you liked him or didn’t like him, things happen,” Trump said in the Oval Office as he presided over a pageant-filled visit for the de facto Saudi leader.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went on to insist Prince bin Salman — who the CIA assessed  likely ordered the murder  — wasn’t involved.\n \n\n   \n  “He knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,” Trump said, turning toward the crown prince.\n \n\n   \n  The moment was the best illustration yet that the period of diplomatic isolation Prince bin Salman endured following Khashoggi’s murder is over. For his first visit to the White House in more than seven years, the crown prince was welcomed with  all the trappings of a state visit , the highest form of American diplomatic reception.\n \n\n   \n  His black Mercedes limousine was escorted onto the South Lawn by a team of dark horses as a military band trumpeted his arrival. A flyover of fighter jets that included F-35s – the jets Trump says he’s planning to sell to Riyadh – blared overhead. Later, Trump is hosting a black-tie dinner in the East Room.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting in the Oval Office, Trump heaped praise on the crown prince, including for what he called his “incredible” record on human rights. The president touted new deals on Saudi investments in the United States, and affirmed his plans to sell the American-made jets, even as the crown prince stopped short of committing to some of Trump’s priorities.\n \n\n   \n  And instead of merely glossing over the 2018 murder, which took place at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Trump took offense that the subject was raised at all during what he intended to be a splashy show of respect.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump told the reporter, longtime ABC White House correspondent Mary Bruce, who questioned him about the murder.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting beside Trump, the crown prince appeared nonplussed by the discussion of his alleged role in the murder, which was committed by Saudi agents who later dismembered the US resident and Washington Post columnist.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s painful and it’s a huge mistake,” Prince bin Salman said, going on to defend a Saudi investigation afterward.\n \n\n   \n  “About the journalist, it’s really painful to hear anyone that been losing his life for no real purpose or not in a legal way, and it’s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia “did all the right steps of investigation” and that “we are doing our best that this doesn’t happen again.”\n \n\n   \n  Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, Jamal Khashoggi’s widow, responded to Trump’s claim that her slain husband was “extremely controversial,” saying that was no reason for him to have been assassinated.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not justification to murder him. Jamal was a good transparent and brave man,” she said in a statement to CNN, adding that “many may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press. The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.”\n \n\n   \n  In  an editorial , The Post wrote that Trump’s comments “dishonor Khashoggi’s legacy, stand at odds with the facts and are beneath the office of the president.”\n \n\n   \n  The CIA assessment released in 2021 found the prince approved the assassination of the Washington Post columnist, though he has long denied any involvement.\n \n\n   \n  “We base this assessment on the Crown Prince’s control of decision-making in the Kingdom, the direct involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin Salman’s protective detail in the operation, and the Crown Prince’s support for using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad, including Khashoggi,” the report said.\n \n\n   \n  During his first term, Trump largely shrugged off Prince bin Salman’s potential role in Khashoggi’s murder, though he described himself as “extremely angry and very unhappy” about the killing.\n \n\n   \n  His successor, President Joe Biden, pledged as a candidate to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah.” But even Biden came to recognize the kingdom and its crown prince were too powerful and influential to ignore entirely. He flew to the country in 2022 in a mostly unsuccessful attempt to convince Saudi Arabia to increase its oil output.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has actively sought to cultivate his relationship with the kingdom in his second term, visiting Riyadh in May to discuss new investments and security arrangements. His interest in the kingdom has drawn scrutiny for his family’s financial interests in the country, though he dismissed those concerns Tuesday. “I have nothing to do with the family business. I have left,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s hope is that Saudi Arabia eventually joins the Abraham Accords, his signature diplomatic achievement, by normalizing its relations with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  But Prince bin Salman made clear that wasn’t happening Tuesday, or anytime before a clear pathway exists for an independent Palestinian state.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to be part of the Abraham Accords,” the crown prince said. “But we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path to a two-state solution.”\n \n\n   \n  So, too, was Prince bin Salman noncommittal when it came to providing funding to help rebuild Gaza. He said he was in “discussion” on the matter before Trump interjected to insist “it will be a lot.”\n \n\n   \n  The crown prince did say he would increase Saudi Arabia’s investment pledge in the United States from the $600 billion announced in May to $1 trillion – a massive figure that’s nearly the kingdom’s entire yearly economic output.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, seemed eager to provide new American assistance to Saudi Arabia, including a defense pact and an agreement that would help the kingdom develop a civilian nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Mostly, however, he seemed intent on honoring the crown prince, who has consolidated power and is now the kingdom’s day-to-day ruler.\n \n\n   \n  “I just want to thank you,” Trump said. “We’ve been really good friends for a long period of time. We’ve always been on the same side of every issue.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/epstein-files-vote-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:48:00-05:00","title":"Congress greenlights bill forcing Trump’s DOJ to release Epstein files after monthslong GOP effort to quash it","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress has passed a bipartisan bill requiring President Donald Trump’s Justice Department to release all investigative files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following months of intense internal GOP conflict and public pressure.

Rimmer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:48 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday took the significant step of ordering  President Donald Trump ’s Justice Department to publicly release all of its investigative files into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after months of nasty infighting within the GOP.\n \n\n   \n  Congress is sending the measure — which remarkably won support from all but one Republican across both the House and Senate — to Trump’s desk once it’s formally transmitted between the chambers. Despite months of calling the issue a “Democratic hoax,” the president has said he’ll sign the bill.\n \n\n   \n  Trump will do so “whenever it gets to the White House,” a senior White House official said Tuesday evening. (The president was already scheduled to host the Saudi crown prince for dinner at the White House Tuesday night.)\n \n\n   \n  The speed with which the bill moved through both chambers of Congress on Tuesday marked a stark reversal from recent months when Trump and GOP leaders worked furiously to quash it. But Trump ultimately decided to allow his party to back the measure as pressure mounted within his party.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, even Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team backed the measure, despite spending the summer and fall trying to quash Washington’s obsession with the Epstein files, while insisting the bill did not do enough to protect victims’ privacy. And in the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune did not stand in the way of Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s request for “unanimous consent” to pass it, sending it directly to Trump once received from the House.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson said earlier Tuesday he was urging his Senate counterpart to add key protections for victims’ privacy, which would have slowed the bill, but Thune said he was unlikely to amend the legislation that came out of the House nearly unanimously. “I think, when a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1, and the President has said he’s going to sign it, I’m not sure that amending it … is in the cards,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Johnson said, “all the Republicans want to go on record to show they’re for maximum transparency.”\n \n\n   \n  It was a remarkable turnaround for Trump and Republican leaders in Washington, who had unsuccessfully tried to halt the measure led by a party agitator, Rep. Thomas Massie, and strongly backed by Democrats. But by this weekend, with a House vote looming, Trump and his team  feared an embarrassing defeat  was coming and he agreed to relent — effectively allowing GOP lawmakers to vote for Massie’s measure.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an overdue moment,” Massie said Tuesday, hours ahead of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win,” the Kentucky Republican said during a news conference on Capitol Hill, quickly adding that they are now “on our side today.”\n \n\n   \n  Massie has been pilloried by Trump and his advisers in recent weeks, including personal attacks on his marriage and a campaign to primary him in his district.\n \n\n   \n  Yet on Tuesday, Massie said he welcomed Trump’s turnaround on the issue: “What he’s doing this week is strengthening his position by coming on board, and we’re glad to have him.”\n \n\n   \n  While Johnson delivered a blistering critique of Democrats over the Epstein saga ahead of the vote, the effort drew widespread support from Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s get accountability, let’s get answers and let’s get this over with,” GOP Rep. Kevin Kiley of California said.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, added of the vote: “We all support holding bad guys accountable, and we’re all going to vote for this resolution.”\n \n\n   \n  The only lawmaker to vote against it, Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, said he did so because of the way the legislation is written. “It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America. As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,” he wrote on X after casting his vote.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Johnson and GOP leaders are hopeful that they can soon turn the page from the months-long Epstein saga within their own conference, which has led to bitter feuds — like the one between Trump and his once-close ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Greene in recent months has joined Massie in pushing for the release of the files, prompting Trump himself to call her a “traitor” and call for her to be ousted in a primary race.\n \n\n   \n  The House’s investigative committees have launched their own inquiries into the Epstein matter.\n \n\n   \n  It was Trump himself who had initially helped gin up the GOP’s interest in the government’s Epstein investigation. The president had repeatedly speculated publicly whether the late financier and sex offender had died in prison and promised on the campaign trail to declassify the files.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s hand-picked DOJ officials had, too, fueled the speculation. When asked by a conservative podcast host in 2023 why the so-called Epstein list had not been released, Kash Patel suggested it was being kept hidden “because of who’s on that list.” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in February of this year that the Epstein client list was sitting on her desk.\n \n\n   \n  But months into Trump’s second term, the White House had released no new information about that investigation. The Epstein issue was quickly creating a major rift between Trump and his MAGA base. Many of his supporters were loudly complaining that the administration was failing to release what Trump once promised he would: the complete set of government files on Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after, Massie, along with his Democratic partner, Rep. Ro Khanna, launched a rogue push to go around the speaker and bring a bill to the floor without GOP leaders’ approval. A handful of other Republicans — all women, including Greene — signed on, too.\n \n\n   \n  The White House resisted the effort, with personal phone calls to members who had backed the measure and public threats to Massie, Greene and others.\n \n\n   \n  But they couldn’t block it entirely. Just days earlier, Massie and Khanna secured the 218th signature on a procedural gambit, known as a discharge petition, that forced Johnson to bring the bill to the floor.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, who provided that final signature to advance the measure, insisted on Tuesday it was not just a Democrat or Republican push.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a demand from the nation. This is not a partisan issue,” Grijalva said.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/middleeast/israeli-strikes-palestinian-refugee-camp-lebanon-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:59:00-05:00","title":"Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon kills 13 people, Lebanon’s health ministry says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 18, 2025, an Israeli airstrike on the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon killed 13 people and injured several others.

billion to restart Three Mile Island nuclear reactor \n       \n  By Reuters\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:11 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  The Trump administration said on Tuesday it has loaned Constellation Energy Corp $1 billion to restart its nuclear reactor at a Pennsylvania plant formerly known as Three Mile Island.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation  signed a deal  in late 2024 with Microsoft to restart the 835-megawatt reactor, which shut in 2019, and which would offset Microsoft’s data center electricity use. The other unit at the plant, renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, shut in 1979 after an accident that chilled the nuclear power industry.\n \n\n   \n  U.S. power demand is now rising for the first time in two decades on technologies including artificial intelligence. Nuclear energy, which is virtually carbon-free, has become an option for technology companies with uninterrupted power needs and climate pledges. Critics point out that the U.S. has failed to find permanent storage for radioactive waste.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Beard, head of the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, or LPO, said the restart would support the PJM regional grid. “This type of energy is important because it’s large, stable, affordable base load power,” Beard told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation said the loan will help it lower the cost of financing and leverage private investment to restore power to the grid.\n \n\n   \n  The LPO has more than $250 billion in capital, and “a large portion of that we expect to be deployed to help reinvigorate the large-scale nuclear reactor development,” Beard said. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said this month that the bulk of the LPO money would go to nuclear projects.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation in June had moved up the timeline to restart the reactor by about a year to 2027 after PJM fast-tracked its review process to connect the project to the grid.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation said it has hired hundreds of workers, completed infrastructure inspections and ordered major equipment for the reactor. It will need to revamp cooling towers, install a main power transformer among other equipment, and re-fuel before producing electricity.\n \n\n   \n  It was the first time the LPO declared that a company had met all conditions for a loan and closed it at the same time, Beard said. Constellation is guaranteeing the loan, he said, and that loan structure would protect taxpayers if the project does not succeed.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation is an “investment-grade” established nuclear operator that could have gotten a bank loan without the government’s help, Beard said. “But we want to show support for affordable, reliable, stable, secure energy in the U.S., as directed by President (Donald) Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The plant also needs U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and water-related permitting, Constellation said this year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/gluesenkamp-perez-garcia-retirement-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00Z","title":"House reprimands Democratic congressman accused of subverting election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives reprimanded retiring Democratic Representative Chuy García for allegedly subverting the election of his successor, a move initiated by fellow Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez.

Chuy García — for what some of his colleagues have described  as an attempt to subvert the election of his successor  in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  What made it even more surprising: It was a fellow Democrat who triggered the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Centrist Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington has infuriated fellow Democrats for her surprise decision last week to force the House to take up the symbolic resolution against García. The Illinois Democrat, first elected in 2018, is under attack for allegedly coordinating his own retirement to ensure his hand-picked replacement would win his seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  Garcia announced his retirement shortly after his state’s filing deadline on November 3 — after his chief of staff had declared her own candidacy. That meant the staffer, Patty Garcia, was the only Democrat running in a primary for a deep-blue Chicago seat he has held since 2019. She is now all but guaranteed to win his seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  Only 22 Democrats voted with Gluesenkamp Perez to reprimand Garcia, along with 213 Republicans. The move has enraged many House Democrats, who argue that their colleague, the moderate Democrat from Washington, is choosing to embarrass their party at a time when it is already sharply divided over ideological lines in the wake of this month’s shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  “It shouldn’t have caused as much friction as it did to speak honestly and consistently about election subversion. Congress is a legislative body, not a social club, and the American people will not accept blind calls to party loyalty in defense of an effort to deny them the right to a free and fair election,” Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement after the vote. “Representative Chuy García has had a long career of public service, and he is retiring for honorable reasons, but election subversion is wrong no matter who’s doing it.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Jeffries and Democratic leaders had been  blindsided by Gluesenkamp Perez’s move , which she announced, without informing leadership, the same day the House voted to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries and his leadership team had sought to stifle the effort, and while the Democratic leader did not formally whip his members, he and his leadership team made clear they did not support it.\n \n\n   \n  “If you are not going to run, you don’t choose your successor — no matter the work you have done beforehand,” Gluesenkamp Perez said on the House floor Monday night, condemning Garcia’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  The Illinois Democrat, however, has sharply disputed the allegations. His office has said his abrupt decision to retire came after he received troubling health news, alongside other family matters, such as his recent adoption of a grandchild after the death of his daughter in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “At a moment like this, he hopes his colleagues, especially those who speak about family values, can show the same compassion and respect that any family would want during a health crisis,” Garcia’s office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  House Democratic leaders issued a strongly worded statement on Tuesday defending Garcia and condemning the “misguided” measure, after unsuccessfully trying to kill the effort earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  “(Garcia) is a good man who has always prioritized the people he represents, even while experiencing unthinkable family tragedy. We unequivocally oppose this misguided resolution and urge our colleagues in the House Democratic Caucus to reject it,” the statement from Jeffries and his leadership team read.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Monday if he had concerns about Garcia’s actions, Jeffries argued that it was not an issue that was important to everyday Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people are focused on the high cost of living in the United States of America. That’s what they’re focused on,” Jeffries said, before adding: “I strongly support Congressman Garcia.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/texas-redistricting-trump-court-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"Federal court bars Texas from using new Republican-friendly US House map in midterms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal court has blocked Texas from using its newly drawn congressional map for the 2025 midterms, ruling that it likely constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.

Texas announced it would appeal to the US Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  The court ordered Texas to use its previous map, which the state enacted after the 2020 census.\n \n\n   \n  If the ruling stands, Republicans could end up on the losing end of the mid-decade redistricting fight they started.\n \n\n   \n  The new Texas map aimed to help Republicans flip five Democratic-held House seats next year, and it kicked off a rush of redistricting efforts from both parties across the country. The Justice Department has joined a similar challenge to the new Democratic-drawn map in California enacted in direct response to Texas aiming to flip five Republican-held seats.\n \n\n   \n  With House Republicans currently holding just a three-seat majority, the five seats at play in Texas could make the difference in who wins control of the House next year.\n \n\n   \n  California Democrats launched their redistricting effort in response to Texas Republicans, and an initial version of their plan would have only taken effect if Texas or another state enacted a map. But the  final ballot measure passed by California voters  contained no such trigger.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, wrote that the challengers were “likely to prove at trial that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.”\n \n\n   \n  The three-judge panel that heard the case split 2-1, with Obama appointee David Guaderrama joining Brown. Reagan appointee Jerry Smith opposed the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “The radical left is once again trying to undermine the will of the people. The Big Beautiful Map was entirely legal and passed for partisan purposes to better represent the political affiliations of Texas,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican.\n \n\n   \n  US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday, “We strongly disagree with today’s district court ruling on Texas’s redistricting map - Texas’s map was drawn the right way for the right reasons.”\n \n\n   \n    Judge criticizes a letter Trump’s DOJ sent to Texas\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s ruling centers on a letter the Trump administration sent to Texas in July in which Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the civil rights division at the Department of Justice, warned of potential legal action over the state’s map because of what it called “unconstitutional” coalition districts, or districts with a non-White majority but where no single racial group makes up a majority.\n \n\n   \n  While Brown calls DOJ’s assertion “legally incorrect,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott cited the letter when he added redistricting to a special session he’d scheduled for the legislature.\n \n\n   \n  “In doing so, the Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to draw a new U.S. House map to resolve DOJ’s concerns. In other words, the Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race,” Brown wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The map ultimately passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor—the 2025 Map—achieved all but one of the racial objectives that DOJ demanded,” Brown wrote. “The Legislature dismantled and left unrecognizable not only all of the districts DOJ identified in the letter, but also several other ‘coalition districts’ around the State.”\n \n\n   \n  Brown skewered Dhillon’s letter in his decision, writing that it’s “challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors.”\n \n\n   \n  “Indeed, even attorneys employed by the Texas Attorney General—who professes to be a political ally of the Trump Administration—describe the DOJ Letter as ‘legally() unsound,’ ‘baseless,’ ‘erroneous,’ ‘ham-fisted,’ and ‘a mess,” Brown wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Even if states aren’t required to draw certain types of districts such as coalition districts under federal civil rights law, Brown wrote that they aren’t prohibited from doing so.\n \n\n   \n  “Nor is it lawful for a legislature to purposefully target such districts for destruction,” Brown wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Before being appointed to the federal bench, Brown served for nearly two decades as a state judge, culminating in six years on the Texas Supreme Court, the state’s highest civil court.\n \n\n   \n  Abbott  celebrated  Brown’s appointment in 2019, noting that the judge had started his career as a law clerk for the governor when he was himself serving on the state Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Abbott said that he had “witnessed firsthand” Brown’s and another nominee’s “sharp legal minds and commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Abbott ripped Brown’s ruling without naming the judge. He said it was “clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.”\n \n\n   \n  Texas Democrats who fought the GOP-led effort – including by  leaving the state  to delay the passage of the map – celebrated Brown’s ruling.\n \n\n   \n  “A federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen,” said state Rep. Gene Wu, who leads the Texas House Democrats.\n \n\n   \n    The national redistricting battles play out in court\n \n\n   \n  The legal wrangling over efforts by Democrats and Republicans across the country to enact rare, mid-decade congressional maps will continue to play out in coming weeks and months. Last week, the Justice Department sued officials in California over newly enacted maps meant to give Democrats in the Golden State an edge next year. A court is set to hear arguments in that case next month.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys with the department are arguing that California’s redistricting plan, which was approved by voters in early November, was sold as a purely partisan effort, when in fact “the focus was not partisanship, but race,” which they say would be impermissible under the US Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps with a nod to the likelihood that Tuesday’s action would likely end up before the US Supreme Court, Brown began the panel’s ruling on the Texas maps by quoting Chief Justice John Roberts  in a 2007 opinion : “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”\n \n\n   \n  To date, Republican-drawn maps across four states, including Texas, have targeted a total of nine Democratic-held seats. Six of those seats have been held by Black or Latino lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the Republican redistricting efforts have argued that the GOP’s hunt for a partisan advantage in Congress has improperly diluted the voting power of racial and ethnic minorities.\n \n\n   \n  “The state of Texas is only 40 percent white, but white voters control over 73 percent of the state’s congressional seats,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement. “It’s quite obvious that Texas’s effort to redistrict mid-decade, before next year’s midterm elections, is racially motivated. The state’s intent here is to reduce the members of Congress who represent Black communities, and that, in and of itself, is unconstitutional.”\n \n\n   \n  The Texas ruling points to one of the remaining legal tools available to groups challenging redistricting efforts.\n \n\n   \n  While the Supreme Court ruled in a 2019 case that partisan gerrymandering could no longer be challenged in federal court, the opinion left open the possibility of challenging racial gerrymanders, including those that violate the 1965 Voting Rights Act – a crowning achievement of the civil rights era.\n \n\n   \n  Civil rights groups say the law has reduced racial discrimination and expanded the number of minority lawmakers not only in Congress but also in state legislatures and even schools boards.\n \n\n   \n  But the ability to bring those suits is now under threat because of a pending case from Louisiana. In that litigation, Louisiana v. Callais, a group of White voters claim that the state violated the Constitution by drawing a second Black-majority district. In other words, they argue that the 14th Amendment shouldn’t allow states to consider race when attempting to fix discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  The court’s 6-3 conservative majority signaled deep reservations with Louisiana’s new congressional map when the court  heard oral arguments in the case  in October. But it was far less clear whether the court would strike down the key provision of the Voting Rights Act entirely or seek to modify it instead.\n \n\n   \n  Just two years ago, the high court rejected similar claims raised by Alabama.

As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,” he  wrote on X  after casting his vote against the bill.\n \n\n   \n  While other Republicans had voiced similar concerns about the measure – including House Speaker Mike Johnson – Higgins’ decision to formally vote against it represented a remarkable break from the rest of the House, which  passed the measure 427-1 . Senate Republican leader John Thune said soon after that he expects his chamber to take the measure up “fairly quickly” – perhaps even later Tuesday – and Trump has indicated he would sign it into law.\n \n\n   \n  But Higgins, a member of the House Oversight Committee from Louisiana, noted that panel’s “thorough” Epstein probe, and indicated he would only support the House-passed bill if it came back with changes from the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “If the Senate amends the bill to properly address privacy of victims and other Americans, who are named but not criminally implicated, then I will vote for that bill when it comes back to the House,” Higgins said.\n \n\n   \n  That does not appear likely.

Mike Braun responded by threatening to “compel” the Senate into a special session to vote on redistricting at Trump’s behest.\n \n\n   \n  It was the latest chapter in an  escalating intraparty battle in Indiana  over the White House’s monthslong effort to bolster the party’s US House majority in time for next year’s midterm elections. Republicans now hold seven of Indiana’s nine US House seats, and Trump is seeking new maps that would give the GOP a shot at a 9-0 sweep.\n \n\n   \n  Indiana takes on more urgency for national Republicans after  a federal court invalidated Texas Republicans’ new map  that would have given them a better shot at gaining five new seats. While Texas officials immediately moved to appeal the ruling, losing that prospective five-seat gain could put the GOP multiple seats behind Democrats in the redistricting battle Trump triggered.\n \n\n   \n  However, despite Trump taking to social media this week to threaten to back primary challenges to senators who oppose redistricting, there were no signs at the statehouse on Tuesday that the opposition would yield.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been a legislator 42 years. I’m not going to change my vote,” said Sen. Vaneta Becker, an Evansville Republican who told CNN her office has received more than 750 calls opposing redistricting and 37 in favor.\n \n\n   \n  “Hoosiers are not used to being sort of in blackmail position. It does not bode well,” Becker said.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers gathered in Indianapolis for “organization day” — the long-planned ceremonial start to the 2026 legislative session. The Senate voted 29-19 to meet again on January 5, a vote that implicitly rejected Braun’s call for a redistricting-focused special session.\n \n\n   \n  Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, a Martinsville Republican who infuriated Trump when he issued a statement saying the Senate does not have enough votes to pass new maps,  told reporters Tuesday that the adjournment vote was “fairly indicative of the vote that you might have seen” if the Senate had voted on new congressional maps.\n \n\n   \n  Trump this week has threatened to back primary opponents to take on Bray, who isn’t up for reelection until 2028, and other Republicans who opposed redistricting, arguing that they are standing in the way of the GOP retaining its majority on Capitol Hill for the last two years of Trump’s presidency. Braun responded later Tuesday afternoon with a statement backing Trump’s primary threats and suggesting he will seek to force the Senate into session to vote on redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, Sen. Rod Bray was forced to partner with DEMOCRATS to block an effort by the growing number of America First Senators who wanted to have a vote on passing fair maps. Now I am left with no choice other than to explore all options at my disposal to compel the State Senate to show up and vote,” Braun said in a statement. “I will support President Trump’s efforts to recruit, endorse, and finance primary challengers for Indiana’s senators who refuse to support fair maps.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Monday posted on Truth Social: “A RINO State Senator, Rodric Bray, who doesn’t care about keeping the Majority in the House in D.C., is the primary problem. Soon, he will have a Primary Problem, as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity.”\n \n\n   \n  Bray on Tuesday said he has had “a couple conversations” with Trump about redistricting and said he is “honored to talk to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  “Frankly, I know that he’s passionate about this issue. I’ve explained to him, as I tried to explain to you guys today, that we want to be helpful. We want to see a Republican majority in the House of Representatives. And this is the best way forward, as we see it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Bray argued that even without new maps, Republicans have a chance to win the 1st District, a traditionally blue seat in northwestern Indiana, and hold eight of Indiana’s nine House seats.\n \n\n   \n  “A number of our caucus members, myself included, don’t see this as a binary choice between the 7-2 ratio that you have right now and redistricting into an automatic 9-0,” Bray said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his political allies had launched an advertising pressure campaign aimed at forcing the state Senate’s hand.\n \n\n   \n  Some veteran Republican legislators said the primary threats rang hollow because of their constituents’ near-unanimous opposition to redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “Hoosiers are very thoughtful, and I know for myself, I represent my constituents,” Becker said.\n \n\n   \n  She added that “it’s not a good look for legislators, in my opinion, to kowtow to that.”\n \n\n   \n  But state Sen. Mike Young, a veteran Indianapolis Republican, took to the floor Tuesday to lambast Bray for refusing Braun’s call for a special session. Young said it was “a slap in the face of the governor of the state of Indiana to do something like this.”\n \n\n   \n  “Imagine waking up on Wednesday, the day after elections next November, and we find ourselves in the minority by one or two votes … knowing that we have the opportunity to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Young said. “Elections have consequences, and we won.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/what-happens-next-epstein-bill","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:45:00Z","title":"Here’s the Epstein bill’s possible path in the Senate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives with near-unanimous support, is now moving to the Senate, where it is expected to pass quickly—potentially by unanimous consent—without changes, despite requests from House Speaker Mike Johnson for privacy-related amendments.

publicly release all its Jeffrey Epstein-related files passed the House on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Although the measure passed with near-unanimous support, it still has to pass a few hurdles before it becomes law and files are ultimately released.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what could be next for the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n \n\n   \n    The bill’s possible path in the Senate\n \n\n   \n  The legislation now moves to the Republican-led Senate, where its once-uncertain path now seems clearer.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republican leader John Thune said he expects his chamber to take the measure up “fairly quickly” – perhaps even later Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that he would move to pass the bill by unanimous consent later Tuesday, and Thune acknowledged that could be successful.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the kind of thing, probably, that could perhaps move by unanimous consent,” Thune said.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s not likely the Senate will make any changes, despite House Speaker Mike Johnson’s public request that the chamber do so.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, when a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1, and the president has said he’s going to sign it, I’m not sure that amending it is, is in the cards,” Thune said.\n \n\n   \n  If it doesn’t pass by unanimous consent, Democrats would need a few Republican senators to vote with them for the bill. A  similar measure  led by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley has two Republican cosponsors, GOP Sens. Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, as of Tuesday, according to Merkley’s office. But momentum is now fully behind the House-passed measure and Thune said his team was “hotlining” it.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson had previously told reporters he was “very confident” the Senate would methodically consider the bill and amend it to better protect people’s privacy. If the Senate were to make changes and pass the legislation by a simple majority, the House would then need to vote again on the Senate-amended version.\n \n\n   \n  But GOP Rep. Thomas Massie, the bill’s main sponsor, argued that any such change could be “just another delay tactic,” and that he felt its privacy protections were adequate as-is.\n \n\n   \n    If the bill passes the Senate\n \n\n   \n  A Senate-passed bill without changes would go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his approval.\n \n\n   \n  If the Senate were to amend it, the bill would moves to Trump’s desk after the Senate version was again passed by the House.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  has said  he will sign the bill into law. But he could also change his mind and choose to veto the bill, which would then require a two-thirds vote to override the president’s veto. He could also decide not to act on the bill, allowing it to become law without his signature.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the the bill becomes law, some lawmakers – like GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who long backed the measure – have questioned whether the Department of Justice would release the files or if the information would remain tied up in ongoing investigations.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has not directed the department to do so, according to an official familiar with the matter. But generally, the department resists giving Congress files during an ongoing criminal investigation because any public release could jeopardize the integrity of the probe or any resulting criminal case. And it’s unclear how the agency might respond if the measure was passed by Congress and signed into law.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/prices-economy-tariff-small-business","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:35:00-05:00","title":"Everyone is hunkering down.

rattling mom-and-pop shops \n       \n  By Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:35 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Surging import costs. Mounting payroll and healthcare expenses. A shortage of affordable loans. And a stressed-out workforce. Small businesses are facing mounting pressure from America’s affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Doug Scheffel, owner of a family-run ETM Manufacturing in Massachusetts, laid off about a quarter of his employees in April as the Trump administration’s haphazard tariff rollout dented demand for the machine parts and sheet metal his company sells.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is hunkering down and building up cash. It’s never been this bad,” Scheffel told CNN in a phone interview. “It’s very uncertain and impossible to plan in this environment.”\n \n\n   \n  Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy, accounting for the vast majority of total businesses in the nation, nearly half of all employees and the  bulk of the job growth. \n \n\n   \n  Like other small businesses, ETM Manufacturing can’t take advantage of growth opportunities because financing is so expensive. The average rate on a new urban small business term loan was over 7% at the end of last year, according to the  Kansas City Fed , but many small businesses face rates well north of 10%.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s infuriating,” Scheffel said.\n \n\n   \n  High prices at the grocery store and elsewhere have left some of ETM’s employees preoccupied with their own finances.\n \n\n   \n  “Most of our employees are distracted. They’re worried about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their kid,” Scheffel said. “Bad stuff happens when they’re not totally focused.”\n \n\n   \n  Scheffel’s employees are hardly alone. About one in four US households are  living paycheck to paycheck , meaning they are spending over 95% of their income on necessities like housing and groceries, according to estimates from Bank of America.\n \n\n   \n  The mood among mom-and-pop shops on Main Street is mixed. While small business owners tell CNN they are hopeful about the future and excited about how artificial intelligence can help them, some are concerned about the headaches incurred by the ever-changing trade war and high costs.\n \n\n   \n  Bryan Pate, CEO of San Diego-based PT Motion Works, an exercise equipment company that sells elliptical bikes, GIBBON SlackBoards and Indo Board balance boards, told CNN that his business is struggling to keep up with rapidly rising healthcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two decades, the average cost of single coverage health insurance  has surged by 120%  for companies with fewer than 50 employees, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), a nonprofit that advocates for small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s unbelievable how much healthcare has gone up,” Pate said, noting this is a big disadvantage small businesses have against large corporations. “It’s an unfair barrier to hiring.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘So much anxiety’\n \n\n   \n  Those healthcare and payroll expenses add to the pressure from the historic tariff hikes under President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “We just don’t know what the guy is gonna do. It creates so much anxiety and time-wasting,” Pate said of Trump’s evolving tariff policies.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has raised tariffs on US imports to an average rate of 16.8%, the highest since 1935, according to  estimates  released by The Budget Lab at Yale on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Pate said his businesses have been hammered by tariffs — including the 20% levy on Taiwan, where its bikes are manufactured.\n \n\n   \n  Ironically, the tariffs are wiping out some US manufacturing jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Pate said his company recently ended contracts with seven assembly workers based in San Diego and now employs workers in Mexico instead. And Pate plans to raise prices on bikes to offset the cost of tariffs but worries that will erode demand.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been economically painful, and long-term, if tariffs stay where they are, it’s just not going to work,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Troy Rackley, CEO at The Next Level of Performance, a Sarasota, Florida-based water treatment technology company, told CNN on the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington he has had to raise prices on some of his products due to US tariffs on imports from Australia and China.   \n \n\n   \n  Rackley dismissed the argument that exporting countries are paying US tariffs and hopes the  Supreme Court rules  against the Trump administration’s use of  emergency powers to justify  its global tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “China, Mexico and Canada don’t pay. I’m the one that’s paying for it,” Rackley said. “I pay taxes on my income, and now I have to pay additional taxes on what I bring in.”\n \n\n   \n    High borrowing costs\n \n\n   \n  Khari Parker, a graduate of the Goldman Sachs small business program and co-founder of Connie’s Chicken and Waffles in Baltimore, isn’t facing any tariff trouble, but he’s struggling to find affordable capital.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve being hit with very, very high rates of 20% to 30%,” Parker said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has worked to support small businesses by providing capital through the Small Business Administration (SBA).\n \n\n   \n  Since Trump took office, the SBA  estimates  it has approved more than 58,000 small business loans worth over $32 billion. For fiscal 2025, which closed at the end of September, the SBA said it guaranteed a record-setting $44.8 billion of small business loans.\n \n\n   \n  Small business  optimism increased  sharply after Trump took office before retreating after Trump’s tariff plans spooked financial markets, according to the NFIB. Optimism later recovered and is currently slightly above its 52-year average.\n \n\n   \n    Immigration crackdown shrinks labor pool\n \n\n   \n  One recurring struggle for small businesses like Parker’s: attracting talent.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard to find workers. We can’t always offer the same competitive benefits or pay that larger businesses can,” Parker said.\n \n\n   \n  For some companies in construction, those challenges have been amplified by the immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of the workforce is nervous from all the stuff going on with immigration,” said Antonio McMillion, president of Maryland-based developer MFP Management & Construction.\n \n\n   \n  McMillion said his company has been forced to hire more expensive workers, raising their labor costs on some projects by up to 40%.\n \n\n   \n  “Hopefully we can pass on the price to the client, but that could also mean you don’t get the job,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Pate, the CEO of PT Motion Works, is very frustrated by tariffs but remains optimistic about the future because of his employees’ resilience in the face of uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  “It could be very depressing and demoralizing,” he said, “but no one is throwing in the towel.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:47:00-05:00","title":"Tracking states’ unprecedented redistricting efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented redistricting campaign to safeguard their narrow House majority ahead of the 2026 midterms, sparking a national political battle with Democrats who are also redrawing maps.

Rigdon, Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:47 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented effort this year to redraw state congressional maps to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have responded with redistricting efforts of their own, setting off a series of fights across the country — including in the courts — which will shape the midterm landscape and help determine control of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Most recently, a  federal court blocked Texas  from using its new map in next year’s midterms, ruling that it is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander and ordering Texas to use its previous map in the election. The ruling is likely to be appealed, but if it stands, Republicans could end up on the losing end of the mid-decade redistricting fight they started.\n \n\n   \n  Not all states are agreeing to redraw their maps. In Indiana, the Republican leader of the state Senate  says there isn’t enough support  to redistrict in that state. Despite that announcement, Republican Gov. Mike Braun has continued to call for the legislature to vote on a new map.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has  sued California over its newly enacted map , which was drawn by Democrats and aims to effectively wipe out potential gains made by Republicans in Texas by helping the party flip five GOP seats in the Golden State. The map was approved overwhelmingly by voters earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/education-department-trump-administration-changes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:37:00-05:00","title":"Trump Administration Accelerates Push to Dismantle Education Department as it Offloads Work to Other Agencies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is accelerating efforts to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education by transferring key offices to other federal agencies — including the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, Interior, and State — under an interagency agreement.

\n        4:37 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Department of Education on Tuesday announced a further dismantling of the agency by transferring much of its remaining workload to other federal agencies in a bid to convince Congress the department is no longer needed.\n \n\n   \n  Under an interagency agreement, six offices will be moved to partner with four other agencies  – the departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, Interior and State, according to a news release.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to begin dismantling the Education Department, seeking to fulfill decades of conservative ambition to get rid of the agency. While eliminating the department requires approval from Congress, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon has sought workarounds to shutter the agency, including cutting nearly half of its staff earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Officials at the Department of Education indicated that the changes announced Tuesday are intended in part to demonstrate to Congress — and ultimately convince lawmakers — that the department is not needed.\n \n\n   \n  “We look forward to having these as proof points for success and what education can look like without the Department of Education building,” another official at the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Plans for the announcement were first reported by the  Washington Post .\n \n\n   \n  According to fact sheets obtained by CNN ahead of the announcement, the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Office of Postsecondary Education will both move to the Department of Labor, while the Office of Indian Education program will shift to the Department of the Interior.\n \n\n   \n  Administration for Children and Families Relating to the CCAMPIS Program and the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation will move to HHS and International Foreign Language Education will go to the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Education Department official said the agency is “still exploring” the best plan for other offices, like the Office for Civil Rights, the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, and Federal Student Aid – divisions whose functions impact a wide swathe of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  McMahon, who has acknowledged that only Congress has the power to eliminate the department, on Tuesday touted the changes as “one essential piece of our final mission.”\n \n\n   \n  “As we partner with these agencies to improve federal programs, we will continue to gather best practices in each state through our 50-state tour, empower local leaders in K-12 education, restore excellence to higher education, and work with Congress to codify these reforms,” she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  According to a congressional source briefed on the changes, the moves are taking place under an agreement in which personnel are sent to other agencies, but technically the Department of Education has some oversight and leadership over them.\n \n\n   \n  The senior education official referred to the arrangement as “co-management” of the shifted offices, adding that the policy and oversight will stay with the Department of Education but the process, particularly with getting grants out the door and monitoring them, will be the responsibility of the partner agency.\n \n\n   \n  There is no effective date for transitioning some staff to the other agencies nor numbers on how many staff would make the physical move from their offices at the Department of Education.\n \n\n   \n  The senior official said there would be a lag time before the changes are fully executed.\n \n\n   \n  “We are really confident that this will end up being something that provides better services, more streamlined services, reduces bureaucracy and in shifting some of these responsibilities to co-management with other agencies we are necessarily narrowing the size and scope of this federal agency in line with the president’s executive order,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  The American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents more than 2,700 Education Department employees, said the plan was unlawful and warned against diffusing the agency’s functions throughout the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “This move comes as the Administration has attempted to fire large numbers of career public servants in these very offices — and is now trying to shift their critical work to agencies with no educational expertise,” AFGE Local 252 President Rachel Gittleman said in a statement, warning that the changes “will only create more confusion for schools and colleges, deepen public distrust, and ultimately harm students and families.”\n \n\n   \n  The American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten echoed concerns about the impact on students.\n \n\n   \n  “This move is neither streamlining nor reform–it’s an abdication and abandonment of America’s future,” she said in a statement. “Rather than show leadership in helping all students seize their potential, it walks away from that responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s announcement marks the Trump administration’s latest effort to build upon the president’s campaign promise to shutter the agency.\n \n\n   \n  Early on in his second term, the administration cut  nearly half of the department’s workforce  as an initial effort to shutter it.\n \n\n   \n  The mass layoffs at the department were initially blocked by lower courts until the  Supreme Court  in July said the administration could proceed for now.\n \n\n   \n  The department, which was created by Congress in 1979 when Jimmy

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The UN Security Council passed a  US-drafted resolution  Monday that aims to move beyond the fragile truce in Gaza to a more sustainable peace and the reconstruction of the devastated enclave.\n \n\n   \n  The 15-member council voted 13 to 0 in favor of the resolution, with abstentions by Russia and China, which declined to use their veto power to block the measure.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution was intended to add international legitimacy to US President Donald Trump’s  20-point Gaza plan , parts of which formed the basis of the ceasefire that took effect in the Gaza Strip last month. The United States had lobbied hard for its passage, which was praised by Trump in a lengthy post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “Congratulations to the World on the incredible Vote of the United Nations Security Council, just moments ago, acknowledging and endorsing the BOARD OF PEACE, which will be chaired by me, and include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World,” Trump wrote Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution authorized elements of the plan, including the establishment of the “Board of Peace” as a transitional authority and the creation of a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, according to a draft seen by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday that “the members of the Board, and many more exciting announcements, will be made in the coming weeks.”   \n \n\n   \n  Some diplomatic sources said the resolution will help grant the authority for countries to participate in the ISF, as it will now have UN backing.\n \n\n   \n  US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz said Monday that the ISF, “a strong coalition of peacekeepers, many from Muslim majority nations like Indonesia, Azerbaijan and others,” will deploy to Gaza “under a unified command” in order to “secure Gaza streets … oversee demilitarization … protect civilians and … escort aid through safe corridors.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, had acknowledged the need for an “international mandate” to support the plan. Ahead of the vote, Waltz warned that “a vote against this resolution is a vote to return to war.”\n \n\n   \n  Although the resolution has passed, many questions remain about its implementation, with the draft appearing vague on sequencing and detail.\n \n\n   \n  Western diplomatic sources have told CNN that the lack of detail in the resolution will make it hard to put into effect. It has faced scutiny for lacking a clear timeline for the transitional authorities to hand over to the Palestinian Authority, saying only that it will do so once the PA “has satisfactorily completed its reform program.” The resolution authorizes the Board of Peace and other authorized “international civil and security presences” until the end of 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution states that the Board of Peace will oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other factions – a key Israeli demand – and the reconstruction of Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the resolution also contains a reference to Palestinian statehood, but it provides no timeline for it.\n \n\n   \n  “After the (Palestinian Authority) reform program is faithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” the draft said.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The representative from Russia, one of the two UN Security Council members to abstain from the vote, said it was important that the resolution not become “a death knell for the two state solution.” A representative of China, the other member to abstain, argued that “it seems Palestine is barely visible in it, and the Palestinian sovereignty and ownership are not fully reflected.”\n \n\n   \n  The resolution calls on UN member states and international oragnizations to work with the Board “to contribute personnel, equipment, and financial resources to its operating entities and the ISF, to provide technical assistance to its operating entities and the ISF, and to give full recognition to its acts and documents.”\n \n\n   \n   Hamas said Sunday that it considered the draft resolution “an attempt to impose international guardianship over Gaza and promote a vision biased toward the occupation.”\n \n\n   \n  After Monday’s vote, Hamas said that giving any stabilization force “tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality and turns it into a party to the conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Palestinians in Gaza were also wary of the resolution, fearing that international forces inside Gaza could do more harm than good for the people trying to rebuild their lives in the enclave.\n \n\n   \n  “Those who are supposed to come now, God willing, may they improve everything for these people,” 38-year-old Um Shadi Al Balbasi told CNN on Tuesday. “But if they come and end up like the ones before them, no. They must be better than those who came before, because the situation, I’m telling you, is absolutely unbearable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Waltz said after the passage of the resolution that the Board of Peace “will coordinate the delivery of humanitarian assistance, facilitate Gaza’s development and support a technocratic committee of Palestinians responsible for day-to-day operations of Gaza civil service and administration while the Palestinian Authority fully implements its reform program.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials have not expanded in detail on what that reform program would look like.\n \n\n   \n  Some Hamas officials continue to rule out disarmament of the group’s military wing. Hamas fighters would be reluctant to give up light weapons to protect themselves from other groups in Gaza seeking retribution.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated Sunday that “Gaza will be demilitarized, and Hamas will be disarmed — either the easy way or the hard way.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s President Isaac Herzog called Monday’s resolution “quite an incredible moment in world politics that could only have been carved out by President Trump, and of course, bringing back all our hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to enable a future of hope, and I hope this resolution of the Security Council, plus people-to-people activities and new initiatives … should lead, hopefully, to some sort of a positive outcome,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/meta-antitrust-suit-decision-not-monopoly","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:22:00Z","title":"Meta Scores a Win After Judge Rules the Social Media Giant Is Not an Illegal Monopoly","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge ruled that Meta is not a social media monopoly, dismissing the Federal Trade Commission’s claim that the company should be forced to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp. The judge, James Boasberg, cited strong competition from platforms like TikTok and YouTube, as well as changes in the social media landscape due to AI-generated content, to argue that Meta’s market share is modest and declining.

media giant is not an illegal monopoly \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:22 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Meta scored a major win on Tuesday after a federal judge ruled that it is not a social networking monopoly, shooting down an argument from the US Federal Trade Commission that it should be forced to spin off two of its most popular platforms.\n \n\n   \n  The Federal Trade Commission  sued Meta  in 2020, accusing it of violating antitrust law by acquiring nascent, would-be rivals Instagram and WhatsApp to avoid having to compete with them. The seven-week trial in the case saw testimony from a series of prominent figures, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who argued that the company has plenty of competition from platforms including YouTube and TikTok.\n \n\n   \n  Federal judge James Boasberg agreed with the company’s argument in his Tuesday opinion, saying that TikTok and YouTube prevent Meta from monopolizing the social network market.   He also noted that Meta’s apps and the social media landscape have changed since the FTC filed its case, most recently because of AI-generated content, which undermined the agency’s arguments.   \n \n\n   \n  “Meta holds no monopoly in the relevant market,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  FTC Director of Public Affairs Joe Simonson said in a statement that the agency is reviewing its options following the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply disappointed in this decision,” Simonson said. “The deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment. We are reviewing all our options.”\n \n\n   \n  A forced breakup would have been a major loss for Meta, which heavily relies on Instagram for ad revenue and WhatsApp for business subscriptions and its international prominence. Although Meta boasts 3.3 billion daily users across its platforms, Zuckerberg’s testimony during the seven-week trial  indicated that the app  with which he founded the company, Facebook, is declining in popularity.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court’s decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition,” Meta Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Newstead said in a statement provided by spokesperson Nkechi Nneji. “Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America.”\n \n\n   \n  The ruling also marks a win for Silicon Valley as US regulators increasingly seek to crack down on the power of Big Tech. Google was recently ruled a monopoly in two separate cases related to its  search  and  online advertising  businesses.  Apple  and  Amazon  are also fighting antitrust cases brought by the government.\n \n\n   \n  Meta, then known as Facebook, acquired  Instagram in 2012  for $1 billion and  WhatsApp in 2014  for $19 billion.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, lawyers for the FTC  pointed  to emails and internal documents that they said showed that Zuckerberg was concerned about competition from Instagram and WhatsApp prior to the acquisitions. They claimed that Meta’s large user base reflected a lack of “reasonable alternatives” for consumers in the social media space.\n \n\n   \n  Meta argued that regulators approved the acquisitions years ago when they were made, and that a forced breakup could harm American competitiveness in the tech space.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg’s ruling argues that Meta’s apps hold only a “modest share” of total time spent in the social media market — which includes Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, MeWe, TikTok and YouTube — and that its share is falling. He added that “even if YouTube is excluded (from the relevant market), Meta still would not hold a monopoly.” (Boasberg’s opinion redacts the specific market share he believes Meta to hold.)\n \n\n   \n  “TikTok — which Meta considers its fiercest competitor — broke into the market only seven years ago … and has been overrunning the market ever since,” Boasberg wrote.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details and context.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/bitcoin-price-crypto-stocks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:05:00-05:00","title":"Why crypto is melting down and stocks keep falling","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bitcoin and U.S. stocks are experiencing significant volatility as investors shift to risk-off strategies amid uncertainty about Federal Reserve rate cuts and overvalued tech stocks.

John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:05 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Bitcoin and stocks are in a bout of volatility — and investors say more turbulence could be in store.\n \n\n   \n  US stocks closed lower Tuesday, extending a  recent tumble . The Dow fell 499 points, or 1.07%. The S&P 500 fell 0.83%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.21%.\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 closed lower for the fourth day in a row, marking its longest daily losing streak since August.\n \n\n   \n  Just six weeks after notching a record high above $126,000, bitcoin has plummeted more than 26%. The cryptocurrency on Tuesday afternoon traded just below $93,000, erasing all of its gains for this year.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin late Monday had  dipped below $90,000  for the first time in seven months before paring some losses early Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Investors in recent weeks have increasingly shunned risky assets like AI stocks and crypto. Not helping: uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. The risk-off attitude is weighing on bitcoin, a highly speculative and volatile investment.\n \n\n   \n  In Wall Street terms, bitcoin is in a bear market — when a price falls more than 20% from a recent peak. Bitcoin has shed more than $600 billion in market value during its tumble, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin’s pullback is part of a broader shift in risk sentiment,” said Haider Rafique, global managing partner at OKX, a crypto exchange.\n \n\n   \n  After a strong six-month rally in stocks, nerves are mounting about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies. A wide range of tech and AI stocks were lower on Tuesday: Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) fell 2.81%. Amazon shares ( AMZN ) fell 4.43% and Microsoft shares ( MSFT ) fell 2.7%.\n \n\n   \n  The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 6.6% since hitting a record high late October and has shed roughly $2.6 trillion in market value during its slide.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 10% on Tuesday.  CNN’s Fear and Greed index  hovered in “extreme fear” and slid to its lowest level since early April.\n \n\n   \n    Bitcoin bear market\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the pressure on bitcoin: Long-term investors may be closing their positions to lock in profits after meteoric gains in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin has struggled as a result of selling pressure from long-term holders taking profits but also uncertainty around Fed policy, the liquidity environment and other macro conditions,” said Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin has struggled to meaningfully recover since a  flash crash  on October 10 when President Donald Trump reignited his trade war with China. Some buyers and sellers have left the market since then, so there are fewer orders for bitcoin, leaving the price more susceptible to volatility, according to Peter Chung, head of Presto Research.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin is under pressure in line with other risk assets (see the price actions of the AI stocks), but its downside is amplified due to a crypto-specific factor — namely, the orderbooks have gotten thinner in the aftermath of the (October 10) liquidations, which hurt many market makers in the space,” Chung said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Bitcoin’s roundtrip — for now\n \n\n   \n  Up until recent weeks, it had been a relatively strong year for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $69,000 ahead of Trump’s reelection in November before surging about 83% — amid bouts of volatility — to its record high above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin  surpassed $100,000  for the first time in early December 2024 as investors leaned in to optimism about the Trump administration ushering in crypto-friendly regulations.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has embraced the cryptocurrency industry and his administration has loosened oversight and advocated for pro-crypto legislation. The  GENIUS Act  was passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump in July, ushering in a new era of regulation for  stablecoins , another kind of crypto.\n \n\n   \n  Trump tapped Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto regulator, to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, and cryptocurrencies continue to enter the mainstream, with new exchange-traded products giving investors easier access to buying and selling crypto.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin traded around $94,000 entering the year. It has now wiped out its gains over the past 11 months. By comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 is up 12.5% this year. Gold prices are up 54%.\n \n\n   \n  While tech stocks have also come under pressure, investors have been swooping in to the buy the dip. Nvidia ( NVDA ) on Friday tumbled as much as 3.36% before finishing the day higher by 1.77%. Nvidia on Monday fell as much as 3.08% before finishing the day lower by just 1.88%.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, bitcoin is still languishing around $93,000 and has yet to see a meaningful rebound. Some analysts say the crypto market is at an inflection point, where the positive catalysts this year have been priced in while there is increasing uncertainty about the outlook.\n \n\n   \n  “How the market behaves over the next several days will signal whether this becomes a deeper reset or just a sharp, temporary dip in an otherwise intact cycle,” Rafique at OKX said.\n \n\n   \n  Some crypto investors are still optimistic. Bitcoin in April had tumbled as low as about $74,500 before surging above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, some investors see sideways churn and get spooked,” said Ryan Rasmussen, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management. “But in our view it’s the perfect opportunity for investors to build on existing bitcoin positions, and for those who have been sidelined to enter the market.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/brian-walshe-trial-case-charges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:08:00Z","title":"Brian Walshe pleads guilty to lesser charges related to death of his wife as murder trial begins","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brian Walshe, a 50-year-old man from Cohasset, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty to lesser charges—misleading police and improper conveyance of a human body—related to the disappearance and alleged murder of his wife, Ana Walshe, a 39-year-old corporate real estate manager and mother of three.

Not long after, jury selection began in his murder trial.\n \n\n   \n  In Norfolk County Superior Court Tuesday morning, Walshe’s attorney made clear he is not admitting to murdering his wife.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a plea deal from prosecutors. Prosecutors refused to negotiate, according to a defense filing, “unless negotiations included the indictment charging murder.”\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe is prepared to admit to the recitation of facts with respect to the indictment that the government just read in so far as it alleges he did impede and obstruct the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Ana Walshe. We obviously object, and he’s not admitting to … murder,” attorney Kelli Porges said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive search for Ana Walshe, 39, was launched after her employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, and her husband told investigators he’d last seen her leaving their Cohasset, Massachusetts, home for a work trip on New Year’s Day.\n \n\n   \n  He was arrested on January 8 and charged with misleading police, and later that month he was charged with her murder.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe faces a maximum sentence of 10 years on the misleading police charge, with up to a 20-year sentence enhancement if convicted of murder. He faces up to 3 years in prison on the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate federal case, Walshe pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. He’s serving a 37-month prison sentence that’s set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death. He’s been in state detention since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s body has not been found, but investigators recovered trash bags of evidence they allege Brian Walshe threw away, containing a hacksaw, a hatchet, and several items with Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood and DNA on them, prosecutors have said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators uncovered a series of chilling internet searches they say Brian Walshe made from his young son’s iPad including: “How long before a body starts to smell?” and “How to stop a body from decomposing,” according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  At the hearing Tuesday, Walshe acknowledged the prosecutors’ allegations and confirmed to the judge that he disposed of her body.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe, did you in fact, willfully remove or convey the body of Ana Walshe or her remains, not being lawfully authorized to do so?” Judge Diane Freniere said.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, Your Honor,” Walshe responded.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors allege Brian Walshe killed his wife because he  wanted to end their marriage  and that he lied to investigators about some of his actions and whereabouts in the days following her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  After Walshe’s arrest, his  defense attorney noted  no body has been found and said there was “no indication of if she died, how she died” and no murder weapon or motive established.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have said they plan to call up to 60 witnesses in the state’s case against Walshe.\n \n\n   \n  Freniere last week ruled Walshe was competent to stand trial after he spent a 40-day stint in a state hospital for mental health evaluation. The judge had delayed the trial – previously set for October 20 – so Walshe could undergo the evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  His attorneys lobbied for the trial delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concerns that Walshe could not adequately assist in his defense after the attack.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the judge said she’s accepted a physician’s report deeming Walshe competent after the evaluation period.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorney Larry Tipton said in open court the defense did not contest his competency.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the day jury selection was supposed to start.

She was  been charged  with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a vehicle under the influence and leaving the scene.\n \n\n   \n  A  mistrial was declared  last year after jurors said they were at an impasse and deliberating further would be futile. In the second trial, a jury found her not guilty of second degree murder and manslaughter charges but did find her guilty of a lesser charge of drunken driving.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s lawsuit was filed against several members of the state police and most of the people at the house party including federal agent Brian Higgins, Nicole and Brian Albert, whose owned the house, and Jennifer and Matthew McCabe. It raises many of the allegations Read’s defense team made during her two trials.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit alleges O’Keefe was killed at the house party during an “altercation during a late night house party with other defendants after a night of heavy drinking.” It says there was a vast conspiracy by members of a well-connected and close social group in the house to cover up the crime. It also accused investigators of shoddy police work, manufacturing evidence and failing to investigate the house for blood, DNA or other evidence or interview anyone at the house.\n \n\n   \n  “The House Defendants responsible for Mr. O’Keefe’s death — some of whom had professional experience with police investigations — concocted a plan immediately after the altercation to avoid culpability and frame Ms. Read,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that state police investigators allowed those defendants to redirect the investigation away from themselves and toward Read.\n \n\n   \n  In statement from their attorneys, Higgins, the McCabes and the Alberts denied the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “The allegations made by Karen Read are entirely false, defamatory, and without merit,” they said in a statement. “Our clients categorically deny each and every claim. This lawsuit is nothing more than a continuation of a baseless conspiracy narrative that has caused significant harm to the reputations and lives of innocent people. Our clients acted responsibly, fulfilling their civic duty as witnesses, and have participated appropriately in the legal process from the outset.”\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit also alleges the investigation, led by former Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, was biased from the start. Proctor was fired after sharing offensive and sexist texts about Read with friends, family and co-workers. During the second trial, Read’s defense attorney Alan Jackson argued Proctor’s “blatant bias” tainted every aspect of the corrupt and flawed investigation.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the Karen Read Civil Team said she “was dragged through a baseless criminal prosecution engineered by individuals who abused their authority, manipulated the investigative process, and trampled her rights.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our complaint lays out, in stark detail, the malicious prosecution, the conspiracy, the civil-rights violations, and the intentional misconduct that these defendants visited upon an innocent woman,” the team added.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for the Massachusetts State Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit, among other things, alleges malicious prosecution under the Fourth Amendment and conspiracy to deprive Read of her Fourth Amendment rights.

Judges, including U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut and Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal, have ruled that such deployments lack constitutional justification, particularly in the absence of a declared rebellion or invasion. In Tennessee, a court blocked the governor’s order to deploy troops in Memphis, asserting that governors do not have unfettered authority to use military force in civilian matters. The Defense Department has ordered troops in these cities to return to their home states due to court injunctions.

In his second term, Trump has continued to push the boundaries of military involvement in domestic matters, whether it comes to addressing public safety, quelling protests or safeguarding federal buildings and personnel, including ICE agents. In response, local and state Democratic leaders have forcefully pushed back and made strides in the courts, where judges have deemed the use of military force as unnecessary or unlawful. Some judges have also expressed wariness around having the military get involved in civilian affairs. \"This principle has been foundational to the safeguarding of our fundamental liberties under the Constitution,\" U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut wrote in her ruling freezing Trump's deployment to Portland, Ore. earlier this month. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The latest court to push back was in Tennessee, where a judge temporarily blocked the state's use of the Guard in Memphis. That deployment was ordered by the governor at the behest of Trump. As the legal challenges mount, the Defense Department over the weekend ordered hundreds of troops in Chicago and Portland to return to their home states after federal courts stalled deployments,  NPR previously reported . Some legal and military experts view the recent events as minor setbacks for the Trump administration. But others see the court decisions as proof of checks and balances at work, at least to some degree. \"There's a pretty common theme that deploying the military into U.S. cities is not something that can be done lawlessly,\" said David Janovsky, a senior policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group. \"It is a good sign that the courts are standing up and saying that.\" Breaking down the Memphis ruling  In Tennessee, a group of Democratic lawmakers and officials filed a lawsuit against Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others, challenging the deployment of the state's National Guard. The plaintiffs argued that Memphis did not face a \"rebellion or invasion,\" which was the criteria for sending the Guard under the state's constitution. Unlike the governors of Illinois, Oregon and California, who have opposed Trump's deployment of Guard forces, the governor of Tennessee approved and directed the deployment in Memphis.  Still, on Monday, Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal sided with the plaintiffs. In her opinion, she wrote, \"The power committed to the Governor as commander-in-chief of the Army and Militia is not unfettered.\" Benjamin R. Farley, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, which   was part of a coalition that provided legal representation to the plaintiffs,   said Moskal's ruling showed that the Tennessee governor does not have blanket authority to deploy troops.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's one more victory in a line of victories for the law against executive overreach, whether that's the president or as is the case here, the governor of Tennessee,\" he said. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NPR that the administration disagreed with the ruling. \"This state court judge fundamentally misunderstood the law and is attempting to act as a policy-maker, not a judge,\" she said in an email. Now, it's important to note that the pause on the deployment has not taken effect, as the chancellor gave the state a few days to appeal. In a statement, Lee spokesperson Elizabeth Lane Johnson said the state will appeal and the Guard will continue to operate in the city. \"Memphians know their city is facing a violent crime emergency that the state must address, and we're confident higher courts will ultimately recognize this as well,\" she said. Janovsky from the Project on Government Oversight said allowing the Guard operations to continue is one way the courts tend to fall short. \"That sort of misreads the stakes of the situation,\" he said. \"If it is presumptively illegal to have troops on the streets, it seems completely backwards to let the troops stay on the street until there's a final determination.\" As federal courts block troop deployments, will SCOTUS have final say? A Defense Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that the holidays may have influenced the decision to  withdraw out-of-state troops from Illinois and Oregon  in the coming days. But retired Maj. Gen. William Enyart, who led the Illinois National Guard from 2007 to 2012, believes the federal courts, which have repeatedly blocked the deployments in Chicago and Portland from moving forward, also played a role. \"This shows the relative strength of the system and of the founding fathers in designing that system, where we had a separation of powers as well as a balancing of powers,\" he added. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration is challenging the rulings that block the use of troops and in the case over the deployment in Chicago, the administration has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. Some legal experts say it could have a ripple effect — to a degree — depending on how broadly the justices rule. \"The more broadly they construe their opinion, the more broad of an effect we're going to see,\" said Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center. Even as debates over the mobilizations play out in various courts, Trump has  suggested sending troops  to about half a dozen other cities, and warned of invoking the Insurrection Act to pave the way. Mirasola said there are limits to how much the courts can restrict the president's use of the military, and ultimately the public serves as a stronger check on power. \"It's always going to be public sentiment that I think is especially consequential,\" he said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611088","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Poll: Democrats have biggest advantage for control of Congress in 8 years","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll reveals that Democrats now hold their largest advantage over Republicans in the congressional ballot since 2017, with a 14-point lead.

November 19, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Heading into the 2026 midterm elections, there are some very big warning signs for Republicans in the latest  NPR/PBS News/Marist poll . The survey of 1,443 adults, conducted from Nov. 10-13, found: Democrats holding their largest advantage, 14 points, since 2017 on the question of who respondents would vote for if the midterm elections were held today; President Trump's approval rating is just 39%, his lowest since right after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol; A combined 6-in-10 blame congressional Republicans or Trump for the  government shutdown ; and  Nearly 6-in-10 say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices — and no other issue comes close. \"I don't think rent prices or food prices are at the forefront like they should be,\" said Nicole Stokes of Dallas, Texas, who participated in NPR's poll and voted for Trump last year. \"You know — the American people — it's our pockets that are getting ripped apart to fund things.\" From the political parties and Congress to the Supreme Court and the media, other respondents said they had little to no confidence in these critical institutions. \"I feel lost,\" said poll respondent Wayne Dowdy of Memphis, Tenn., who calls himself a \"lapsed Democrat.\" \"The parties don't speak to me anymore.\" He said he often feels unseen by the Democratic Party, but, given the alternative, he plans to keep supporting Democratic candidates — for now. The disillusionment extends to how people see those in the opposite political party. Big majorities of Democrats and Republicans said the other party is \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\" about politics. All of it makes for a volatile political stew heading into the holidays, but with Republicans in charge of all the levers of power in Washington, Democrats have the clear advantage a year out from next year's midterm elections. Democrats in the driver's seat for control of Congress Coming off huge wins up and down the ballot across the country in this year's off-year elections, Democrats lead Republicans, 55%-41%, when people were asked who they would vote for in their district if the election for Congress were held today. It's the largest Democratic advantage on this question, known as the congressional ballot, in the Marist poll since November 2017. The parallel is striking, considering that was at the same point in Trump's first term as this poll now. Democrats wound up winning 40 House seats in 2018. What's more, independents chose Democrats by a 33-point margin on this question. It's all quite the reversal of fortune from a year ago when, just before the 2024 elections when President Trump won back the White House, the parties were tied on the congressional ballot. Historically, Democrats have needed a sizable advantage on the congressional ballot to signal that they would do well in upcoming midterms. Consider: In the fall of 2022, with Democratic President Biden in the White House, Democrats' lead ranged from 0 to 4 points. They  lost nine House seats ; In 2018, during Trump's first term, Democrats' lead ranged between 6 and 12. They won 40 seats;  In 2014, when Democrat Barack Obama was president, Republicans had a 5-point advantage. The GOP gained 13 seats. All that said, with redistricting, the  number of competitive seats  has  shrunk significantly , so major gains are less likely than they were in previous years. Trump has also encouraged conservatives in red states to try and create more Republican districts in rare mid-decade redistricting. Democrats have responded in kind, so the landscape for control of the House for next year remains uncertain at this point. The Trump drag on the GOP A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular. Not only is he at 39% approval, the lowest of this second term in the Marist poll, but he gets just a 24% rating with independents as well. Overall, almost half of those surveyed — 48% — said they  strongly  disapprove of the job the president is doing. That's also the highest of this term and the highest since just after Jan. 6, 2021. The president has seen low ratings for his handling of various policy areas, including the  economy  and  foreign policy , and people think he's  gone too far  on immigration. Trump  has said  on  more than one occasion  in this second term that while campaign advisers told him prices were the most important issue, he always felt it was really immigration. But respondents in the NPR survey are sending a clear message: they think the cost of living should be Trump's top priority. Almost 6-in-10 — 57% — said lowering prices should be his top priority. Immigration is a distant second at 16%. Even a plurality of Republicans (40%) said lowering prices should be the priority compared to immigration (34%). Despite Trump's slide in approval ratings, he's holding up well with his base — 9-in-10 Republicans continue to say they approve of the job he's doing. Stokes, the Trump voter from Dallas, said a year into his presidency, said she's pleased by his attempts to tackle illegal border crossings and restrict U.S. foreign aid, but she is concerned that the president hasn't made the economy a focus. But her support of Trump doesn't translate to Republicans on Capitol Hill. Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party. \"They're not in tune with anyone on the ground,\" Stokes said. \"I don't really see anyone in [the House] or in the Senate that's really for the American people right now.\" It's not just Trump. Democrats and others get low marks Trump's approval is low and so is confidence in the office he holds — 61% said they have little to no confidence in the institution of the presidency. But the scores were even poorer for other key institutions. Worst among them was Congress — 80% said they had little to no confidence in it, followed by the media (75%), the Democratic Party (71%), the Republican Party (65%) and the Supreme Court (62%). This is yet another poll that shows Democrats have a problem with their base. While 80% of Republicans have \"quite a lot\" or a \"great deal\" of confidence in the GOP, just 57% of Democrats said the same of their party. Despite long supporting liberal candidates, Dowdy, the Democrat from Memphis, argues the party has become disconnected from everyday voters. \"They don't interact with working people,\" he said, \"regardless of whether they work in an office or on a job site or building homes or working in a factory. They don't know how people like that live... They have no connection to the real people. And there's no attempt to try and reach that.\" And yet, Democrats have a wide advantage on the congressional ballot, which, coupled with the electoral gains earlier this month, indicate that left-leaning voters may rally to Democrats' side when faced with having to choose between them and Republicans. Democrats and Republicans see each other as \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\" It's no wonder political acrimony is as high as it is in the country; people have very little respect for where the other side is coming from. The survey found that more than 8-in-10 Republicans and Democrats described people in the other political party as \"closed-minded\"; more than 7-in-10 Republicans and roughly two-thirds of Democrats also see the other as \"dishonest\" when talking about politics. Independents have better views of Democrats than Republicans. They said Republicans were more dishonest and closed-minded than Democrats with a majority of independents (54%) saying Republicans were \"mostly dishonest\" compared to more than 6-in-10 saying Democrats were \"mostly honest\" when it came to politics. Nearly 7-in-10 independents also described Republicans as mostly closed-minded, while a majority (53%) said Democrats were mostly open-minded. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98459","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:46:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration seeks to roll back protections for imperiled species and habitat","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration announced new proposals to roll back protections under the Endangered Species Act, reviving rules from its first term that were previously blocked under President Joe Biden.

\n        \n           Wednesday, November 19, 2025 • 6:46 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         BILLINGS, Mont. — President Trump's administration moved Wednesday to roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live, reviving a suite of changes to Endangered Species Act regulations from the Republican's first term that were blocked under former Democratic President Joe Biden. The proposed changes include the elimination of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened. Government agencies instead would have to craft species-specific rules for protections, a potentially lengthy process. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The administration's announcement answers longstanding calls for revisions to the Endangered Species Act from Republicans in Congress and industries including oil and gas, mining and agriculture. Critics argue the landmark 1973 environmental law has been wielded too broadly, to the detriment of economic growth. But environmentalists warned the changes could cause yearslong delays in efforts to save species such as the monarch butterfly, Florida manatee, California spotted owl and North American wolverine. \"We would have to wait until these poor animals are almost extinct before we can start protecting them. That's absurd and heartbreaking,\" said Stephanie Kurose with the Center for Biological Diversity. Scientists and government agencies say extinctions are accelerating globally because of habitat loss and other pressures. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump has made oil and gas production a centerpiece of his presidency and sought to strip away environmental regulations that impede development. Other pending proposals from the administration would revise the definition of \"harm\" under the Endangered Species Act and potentially bypass species protections for logging projects in national forests and on public lands. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement that the administration was restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent while respecting \"the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources.\" \"These revisions end years of legal confusion and regulatory overreach, delivering certainty to states, tribes, landowners and businesses while ensuring conservation efforts remain grounded in sound science and common sense,\" Burgum said in a statement. Another proposed change tasks officials with analyzing economic impacts when deciding whether habitat is critical to a species' survival. Case of lizard shows potential outcome of proposals The case of the Yarrow's spiny lizard in the Southwest exemplifies the potential consequences of the proposals. Rapidly warming temperatures have ravaged a population of the lizard in Arizona's Mule Mountains, pushing the reptiles further up the mountainsides toward the highest peaks and possibly toward extinction. A petition filed Wednesday seeks protections for the lizard and the designation of critical habitat. Advocates say analyzing the economic impacts could delay protections. Designating critical habitat could be another hurdle because the primary threat to this population of spiny lizard is climate change. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We think that the species should be listed as endangered. In fact, we are somewhat shocked that it is not already extinct,\" said John Wiens, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, who co-authored the petition. The Interior Department was sued over the blanket protection rule in March, by the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) and Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. The two groups argued the rule was illegal and discouraged states and landowners from assisting in species recovery efforts. Species designated as \"threatened\" under the rule automatically qualify for the same protections as those with the more severe designation of \"endangered.\" PERC Vice President Jonathan Wood said Wednesday's proposal was a \"necessary course correction.\" \"This reform acknowledges the blanket rule's unlawfulness and puts recovery back at the heart of the Endangered Species Act,\" Wood said. Proposals would undermine protections, critic says Kristen Boyles with the environmental law firm Earthjustice said the changes undermine protections even more than in Trump's first term. That includes allowing the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to not count negative effects on species if those impacts are not regulated by the agencies themselves, Boyles said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The Services are required to prevent harmful consequences to species, not ignore them,\" she said. Trump officials during his first term also rolled back protections for individual species including the northern spotted owl and gray wolf. The spotted owl decision was reversed in 2021 after officials said Trump's political appointees used faulty science to justify opening millions of acres of West Coast forest to potential logging. Protections for wolves across most of the U.S. were restored by a federal court in 2022. The Endangered Species Act protects more than 1,600 species in the United States and its territories. It is credited with helping save the bald eagle, California condor and scores more animals and plants from extinction since Republican President Richard Nixon signed it into law. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1150101665","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"2024 Political Summit Yields Major Agreements on Cooperation, Education, and Green Energy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early April 2024, political leaders convened in a summit that led to a landmark agreement on regional cooperation, strengthening cross-border collaboration.

Build an outfit with this paper doll \n         By Wynne Davis \n        \n           Updated Monday, December 4, 2023 • 9:28 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         I'm training for my first full marathon this year. But it's hard for me to stay motivated when the weather gets cold. Where I live in Washington, D.C., the temperature can have such a wicked bite that I'd rather stay in my cozy bed than go out for a run. How do other runners do it?  To get advice, I turned to Alison Mariella Désir, an athlete, activist and the author of the book  Running While Black: Finding Freedom in a Sport That Wasn't Built for Us . She's the founder of the running collective Harlem Run in New York City. And she's a huge fan of running in the cold. \"I love the cool air on my face. I love the feeling of being really badass because you're one of the only people out there,\" she says.  The key to facing the cold, says Désir, is your outfit. You need to dress for the weather, which means wearing clothing and layers that can protect you from the wind, rain or snow.  And remember — once you get moving, your body is going to feel about 15 to 20 degrees warmer than it actually is outside, according to  the Mayo Clinic. Désir and  Dr. Kelechi Okoroha , an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic, explain what to wear in three different temperatures: when it's in the 50s, when it's in the 30s and when it's below freezing. Make sure to pair all these outfits with a solid pair of running shoes.  When it's in the 50s: Focus on sweat-proof materials The goal in dressing for this weather is anticipating that you're going to start off feeling cold. But once you start running, it's going to feel like the 70s, says Désir,   which is pretty warm. For this reason, layers are your friend, says Okohora.  \"A common mistake in dressing outdoors is dressing too warmly which can cause excessive heat generation and sweating, which ultimately makes you more cold,\" he says. \"So dress in layers that you can remove as soon as you start to sweat — then put them back on as needed.\" Start out with a short-sleeve shirt and shorts (yes, shorts — they're going to give you more of a breeze when you start to warm up), then add a long-sleeve shirt to go over the first layer, says Désir. \"Very quickly that long-sleeve shirt [will] come off and [I'll] tie it around my waist.\"  \"Make sure the layers closest to your body repel water,\" she adds. Moisture-wicking material pulls sweat away from your body without soaking your clothes. This helps regulate your body temperature and keep you dry. Look for sweat-proof shirts, sports bras, shorts and socks made out of synthetic fiber like polyester or nylon. A wool blend works too.  Avoid cotton as your base layer. When cotton gets wet, it stays wet and that can lead to a soggy, miserable run. Running in the 50s checklist Moisture-wicking shirt, bra, shorts and socks  Long-sleeve shirt When it's in the 30s: Add layers and accessories As the temperature drops, add more layers to your base outfit. Start by trading your shorts for leggings. \"If it's 30 degrees, I would go out wearing sweat-wicking tights and another layer [of tights or pants] on top of that. Or I would wear fleece-lined tights,\" says Désir.  For the top half of your body, keep the moisture-wicking layers and the long-sleeve shirt, then put on a light windbreaker jacket or an insulated vest for extra warmth. Then consider your accessories, says Désir. Keep your ears toasty by donning a hat, a fleece headband or earmuffs. Wear breathable, moisture-wicking  gloves . As for your feet, switch from regular socks to wool socks to keep those toes warm and dry. Wet socks can soften the skin — and the heat, moisture and friction from running can cause blisters to form.  Running in the 30s checklist In addition to the items above, add:  Fleece-lined tights Lightweight windbreaker Insulated vest Earmuffs, fleece headband or hat Gloves Wool socks  When it's below 30: Consider your face, neck and safety When the temperature dips below freezing, I don't know that I personally want to run outside. But if you do, put on all your previous layers, says Désir. They'll continue to keep you warm in this weather. Add a balaclava, scarf or neck gaiter to protect your face and neck from the chilly air (you can pull the gaiter or arrange the scarf over your nose and mouth).  And if the streets are wet from the rain or slushy from the snow, switch to running shoes that have a good tread on the bottom and are made with a waterproof material like Gore-Tex. They can help keep your feet dry and give you a little more grip on slippery surfaces when you run.  In these conditions, you might also want to slow down your pace and shorten your stride to avoid slipping and falling, says Désir.  Keep your head up too and avoid looking at the ground. \"Rain often makes us look down directly at our feet, meaning we might miss hazards ahead of us,\" she adds. She recommends a waterproof hat with a brim that can allow you to see more clearly and stay dry. You should also consider how dark it's going to be when you're outside. There are fewer hours of sunlight in the winter — and rain or snow can lead to gray skies that decrease your visibility. Wear light-colored running clothes and reflective gear, like a light-up safety vest, so that drivers and pedestrians can see you on the road, says Désir.  Running below 30 degrees checklist In addition to the items above, add:  Balaclava, neck gaiter or scarf Waterproof running shoes with good grip Safety vest  Is it ever too cold to exercise outside?  Okoroha of the Mayo Clinic says there are times when you should opt for a treadmill run or another type of indoor workout. Before exercising in cold weather, make sure it's safe for you to do so, says Okoroha. People with medical conditions such as asthma, heart disease or  Raynaud's disease,  which can cause body parts to feel numb or cold, should check with their doctor first as these conditions may be exacerbated by the cold. Once you get the green light, the first thing to do is check the temperature.  \"If the wind chill or the temperature is below zero degrees, consider indoor activity because the chances of frostbite are higher,\" Okoroha says.  Frostbite happens when it's so cold that \"your blood flow gets concentrated in your body's core and leaves other areas like your hands, your feet, your head, your ears, [which then] become vulnerable to frostbite.\"  You also want to check for rain, snow or other precipitation before you go out. \"Getting wet makes you more vulnerable to cold and should be avoided if possible,\" he adds.  That's also when hypothermia, a condition that happens when your body temperature is abnormally low, can become a risk.  It's most common when temperatures are extremely frigid, though it can happen with temperatures in the 40s if you are already chilly from wet conditions, like sweat or rain,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .  The good news is that wearing outfits made up of layers can help prevent both frostbite and hypothermia, Okoroha says — so be diligent about checking the temperature before you head out and   wearing the appropriate gear. As for me, this guidance has made it easier for me to get my winter runs in. Last week, I went out in my fleece-lined leggings and puffer vest in 30-degree weather after some rain and it was refreshing. I'm not ready to say I love the cold like Désir does, but I am learning to enjoy it more. This episode of Life Kit was produced by Clare Marie Schneider.

I'm Marielle Segarra. And I'm joined by NPR's Wynne Davis. Hey, Wynne. WYNNE DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Marielle. So I heard you like to run. SEGARRA: I do. DAVIS: Same here. But what about when it's cold out? SEGARRA: You know, if it's less than 40 degrees, I'm probably not going to do it, to be honest. DAVIS: Yeah. This is something that I struggle with, too. You know, in the winter, it's extremely hard for me to get out of the door and go for a run or a bike ride because it's just so cold out. But not everyone feels that way. ALISON MARIELLA DESIR: Unpopular opinion - I love running in the cold. It is my absolute favorite time of year. And it's funny because my husband hates the cold and loves running in the summer, so opposites truly do attract. SEGARRA: That's Alison Mariella Desir. She's a mother, an athlete, an activist and the author of the book \"Running While Black.\" DESIR: I just love it. I love the cool air on my face. I love the feeling of being really badass because you're one of the only people out there. I love the clothing. I love layers - literally everything. SEGARRA: It sounds like she's got a whole system. DAVIS: Yeah, she does. And we'll get into it soon. In this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to talk to experts about what motivates them to get outside when it's cold. We'll hear safety tips for the winter months, and we'll learn how to build an outfit that will keep you warm so you can get moving. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: OK, Wynne, so I feel like one of the big barriers that keeps people from running outside in the cold is it's just so cold, right? Like, it can be super uncomfortable, and running already involves some level of pain. So this is really a psychological barrier. I just wonder where Alison gets the motivation to get out there. DAVIS: Right. So much of running is mental. Alison says it can depend on if she's training for a race. In that case, you know, she wants to get her miles in so that when race day comes, she's ready. But she also reminds herself that she feels better, both mentally and physically, after a run. So going outside, even when it's cold, will give her a boost later. SEGARRA: OK. That's the mindset part. But then once you get outside, it is still going to be cold. So what do you do to prepare for the physical challenge - right? - the rain, the chill? DAVIS: Yes. You have to prepare for the elements. And obviously, a big part of that is how you dress. So in the summer, you're trying to stay cool, but in the winter, you want to be warm. You don't want to overheat. Both the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic note that when you get moving, you're going to feel about 20 degrees warmer than it actually is outside. And Alison had some good advice on how to build your ideal outfit so you can get out the door depending on the temperature. DESIR: Let's say it's, like, 50 degrees outside. So the air is crisp, but the sun is peeking out. Bear with me now. I would wear shorts, a short-sleeved shirt that is a wicking material and then a long-sleeved shirt over that. And I would start out very cold, but very quickly, that long-sleeved shirt would come off, and I would tie it around my waist, and I would be sweating, right? Because when you're moving - 50 degrees - it will feel like 70 degrees by the time you get moving. DAVIS: Alison said she might also add things like gloves or a headband, and then she'll make adjustments throughout the run based on how she feels. SEGARRA: OK. I do have to say, for a New Yorker, 50 degrees is actually totally reasonable. Like, some people might even call that ideal running weather. DAVIS: Yeah. I'd have absolutely no problem running in that weather. And we can talk about when it gets colder. But, you know, this is cold for some people who live in California, Florida, whatever. SEGARRA: OK. Yeah. That's fair. What is the wicking material she mentioned? DAVIS: Yeah. The moisture-wicking material - what it does is it pulls the sweat you're making away from your body without soaking your clothes. Essentially, it's there to help keep you dry and keep your body temperature where it needs to be. You can go for a synthetic fiber here, like polyester or nylon. Or a wool blend works, too. The big thing is you just don't want anything made of cotton because that's going to get wet and stay wet, and then you're going to be cold and miserable. SEGARRA: So what about when it gets colder, like in the 30s? DAVIS: This is when you're really going to start building more layers or kind of stepping up an existing layer. DESIR: If it's 30 degrees, I would go out wearing a base layer of tights - you know, some wicking tights underneath and then maybe another layer on top of that, or I would wear fleece-lined tights. On top, I would wear a wicking short-sleeved shirt. SEGARRA: Again, here's the plug for wicking material. Alison says that that base layer that repels water sets the foundation for the rest of the outfit. DESIR: Then I would wear a long-sleeved shirt over that, and I would definitely wear a jacket, a running jacket. I would wear something over my ears. I'm not really a hat person. I have a massive head. So I would wear, like, earmuffs, and I would wear gloves. SEGARRA: OK. And what about when it's really cold outside, like, frigid, don't-want-to-leave-your-house cold? I'm talking, you know, 2 degrees. DAVIS: At this point, I don't know that I personally would want to go outside. But if you do, this is where you want to start adding some extra protections for your face, like one of those neck gaiters that you can pull up and down. But you also need to think about keeping your feet warm and dry. That's where a good pair of wool socks comes in. If it's wet or slushy outside, Alison says that a pair of running sneakers with Gore-Tex or another waterproof material can help, too. And this can also really help you avoid those uncomfortable blisters, which are the worst. SEGARRA: So this sounds like potentially a lot of gear. I wonder, does it get super-expensive? DAVIS: It can because, you know, a lot of athletic wear isn't cheap. But Alison says that the most important thing here is the sweat-wicking layer, a pair of wool socks and one good pair of shoes. Everything else you can build on as time goes by. You don't need to have every piece of specialized gear to get outside and go for your run. SEGARRA: All right. So what else should people keep in mind before they head out the door to run in the cold? DAVIS: Safety is a big one. In the winter, there aren't as many hours of light. So more people might end up running in the dark. DESIR: I want to also say that I hate these kinds of conversations only because the world is unsafe, and therefore we must change our behavior to take care of ourselves when it really should be, how can we make the world a safer place for us? SEGARRA: Yeah, I get that. I mean, it's frustrating. I pretty much only run during the day for safety reasons. And in the winter, that is a lot harder. So sometimes I'll try to run in the afternoon when I'm working remotely, but it's not always possible. DAVIS: Yeah. And Alison talks about this in her book, too. DESIR: You know, it's not often that I can run smack in the middle of the day. So thinking about running with my partner or linking up with a local running group - as a woman, as a Black woman, I rarely go out by myself in general but, in the winter, even less because I don't want to end up in a sticky situation by myself in the dark. DAVIS: Alison gave us some of her must-haves for staying safe. The first is a huge one for her, and it might surprise some people. DESIR: First and foremost, I would say never run with headphones. SEGARRA: I feel like that might be a hard one for folks. DAVIS: Yeah. I mean, I can definitely understand why. I really like to run with music. I do have headphones that allow me to hear the street noise, but ultimately, the music is still a distraction. SEGARRA: OK, so no headphones. What else? DAVIS: Reflective gear is also really important because when it's dark out, you want to be as visible as possible to those who are driving cars. But, you know, sometimes you have to be outside at night. And in those cases or even when you're with a buddy, Alison says it's a good idea to let people know where you are through a tracking app. DESIR: I use Strava. It allows me to send a notification to people to let them know where I am and that I'm out on the road. So, God forbid, you do slip on something and you end up unable to move, you know, you have that app. SEGARRA: Are there any privacy concerns here? - 'cause it sounds potentially creepy if people can see where you are at all times. DAVIS: Yeah. Strava has faced some criticism about privacy issues in the past, but you can make it so that only people who follow you see your activity. And it is possible to hide the start and finish points of your run so people won't know your exact route even if they follow you. SEGARRA: All right. So you can take some precautions. DAVIS: Definitely. And, you know, there are plenty of other apps out there that can share your location, including the Find My app for Apple users. But there are some other things that are good to take with you just in case. DESIR: Always bring some amount of money and an ID. So those are sort of, you know, things that are on my list to take with me and always just to, again, acknowledge I'm a Black woman moving outdoors, which is often a white space - keep my head on a swivel. SEGARRA: OK. So we've been talking about safety in general, but what about when it comes to medical conditions, right? You are going to be exercising in potentially extreme situations. DAVIS: Yep. And here I talked to Dr. Kelechi Okoroha. He is an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic. He said that certain conditions like asthma, heart disease and Raynaud's disease may be exacerbated by the cold. KELECHI OKOROHA: So I think the first thing you need to do is make sure exercising outdoors is safe for you. So that means if you have a medical condition, you need to consult with your doctor to make sure your condition or medication does not preclude you from safely exercising outdoors. SEGARRA: OK. So you determine that it's safe for you personally to exercise outside in the cold. But I know that, you know, in the summer, people are often told to look out for signs of heatstroke when it's really hot out. What should they be watching out for in the cold? DAVIS: Frostbite and hypothermia. Here's how Dr. Okoroha explains frostbite. OKOROHA: Frostbite is an injury to the body that's caused by freezing. And what happens is when it's cold, your blood flow gets concentrated in your body's core, and it leaves other areas like your hands, your feet, your head, your ears. And that becomes vulnerable to frostbite. DAVIS: So the symptoms start with cold skin and a prickling feeling. Numbness and discoloration of the skin happen when it gets worse. SEGARRA: OK. And how does frostbite differ from hypothermia? DAVIS: So hypothermia is when you have an abnormally low body temp. OKOROHA: And so when you're exposed to cold temperatures, your body begins to lose heat faster than it can be produced. And so exercising in cold or rainy weather can increase your risk of hypothermia. Some signs and symptoms of hypothermia are things like intense shivering, slurred speech, loss of coordination or even fatigue. SEGARRA: What happens if someone starts to recognize the symptoms for either one? DAVIS: With both hypothermia and frostbite, Dr. Okoroha says it's important to get out of the cold as soon as you can and slowly begin to warm yourself up. Going slow here is really important because if you've lost feeling in your hands, for example, you really might not be able to recognize the temperature of things. So you might be using water, and it might actually be way too hot, and you could end up burning yourself. Ultimately, though, if the conditions persist, you should seek medical treatment from a doctor or an emergency room. SEGARRA: Is it ever too cold to run outside? DAVIS: Yes. It does reach a certain point where you should not go out. OKOROHA: Generally, we recommend if the wind chill or the temperature is below zero degrees, you should consider indoor activity because the chances of frostbite are higher. And then additionally, you also want to check the moisture level because getting wet makes you more vulnerable to cold and should be avoided if possible. SEGARRA: All right. So be careful if the temperatures are low. Another thing I'm wondering is about snow, right? Like, it's very easy to fall down if you slip on ice, even if you're just walking. So can people run in the snow? Like, what do they have to think about? DAVIS: Yes. You can run in the snow. You just really want to be careful. I looked into this, and the consensus is that you want to take it slow, and you want to shorten your stride so that you are less likely to fall. And you should still watch out for ice if the snow isn't fresh or if it has snowed and then rained. SEGARRA: OK. So you know what? I feel pretty good about this. Now I know how to build my outfit if I'm running outside, what I'm looking out for in terms of frostbite and hypothermia and then, just in general, how to be safe. Is it go time? Can I go for a run? DAVIS: I think so. I think we're just about ready. The only other things that people should keep in mind that they, you know, might otherwise forget are that sunscreen is still a must even if it's cloudy out, even if it's cold. You can still get sunburn in any weather. And, you know, everyone needs to remember to hydrate before your run, after your run and during your run. SEGARRA: Yeah. These are evergreen tips, actually. Wear sunscreen. Drink water. DAVIS: Yep. You've got it. And now I'd say we should get out there. SEGARRA: Let's do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

Scientists study how well 'California sober' works \n         By Will Stone \n        \n           Wednesday, November 19, 2025 • 12:01 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         Could smoking pot lead people to drink less alcohol? In an elaborate and provocative experiment, scientists doled out joints and free drinks to see whether this idea — sometimes described as \"California sober\" — survived scientific scrutiny. The new research offers some of the strongest data yet suggesting that smoking weed does, at least in the short term, curb how much people drink. The  findings were published  in the  American Journal of Psychiatry  on Wednesday — and are sure to raise questions about the merits of swapping one of these substances for another, especially given growing concern in the public health field about the popularity of cannabis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And the researchers are cautious about making any recommendations based on their findings at this point. \"We're not ready to tell people seeking treatment for alcohol, go ahead and substitute cannabis, and it will work out for you,\" says  Jane Metrik , a professor of behavioral and social science at Brown University who led the study. But the research does bring scientists closer to understanding the link between these two substances, at a time when many people are leaning on marijuana to cut back on drinking, without waiting for the evidence. \"This study really moves the field forward by helping to resolve one of the unresolved questions in the literature,\" says  Jeff Wardell , a professor of psychology at York University. \"This gives us more confidence that there's a real effect here.\" Getting high for science In the Brown study, the team took pains to replicate the real-life circumstances of getting stoned and drinking, while still maintaining a tightly controlled study that could point toward a causal relationship. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       They constructed a laboratory that resembles a bar, with comfy seats and a tap, and ensured each participant had their preferred alcoholic beverage on hand. \"We wanted to make sure that when given the opportunity, you would be really driven to drink,\" says Metrik, who ended up spending substantial time shuttling between liquor stores looking for special vintages and spirits. The experiment included three separate sessions. In one of them, participants smoked a marijuana joint with higher levels of the psychoactive compound, THC; in another they used a lower potency strain; and the last, researchers gave them a placebo with a trace amount of THC that wasn't enough to get them high. After toking up in a designated smoking room, each participant spent the next two hours in the \"bar lab\" on their own where they had the opportunity to drink up to eight mini drinks. The people who smoked the higher potency cannabis ended up drinking 27% less alcohol, and the lower potency about 19% less, compared to the placebo. People who used cannabis also delayed their drinking. \"It is an important signal that we're detecting,\" says Metrik. \"It is telling us that cannabinoids could play a potential therapeutic role in alcohol use disorder.\" Previous research has suggested that cannabis may reduce alcohol cravings and how much people drink. But the results have been largely inconclusive, in part because the data often come from observational studies, which are less reliable and can be muddied by other factors. Animal studies have also indicated potential biological mechanisms behind weed's effect on alcohol; however, there's a question of how much this applies to humans. The new study also builds on what a team of researchers in Colorado  reported earlier this year  in a slightly different experiment. There, participants instead picked up their marijuana from a dispensary, smoked it at home and then visited a mobile lab parked nearby, where they were offered alcoholic beverages. The amount people ended up drinking dropped by about 25% when they were already stoned. Cravings also went down. \"These findings are all converging on a similar story,\" says  Hollis Karoly , an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz who led the study. But she points out there are still big questions about how much you can extrapolate from this new evidence.  Replacing one problem with another? One obvious limitation is that how someone behaves when every sip they are taking is under close observation may not necessarily reflect what happens in a much looser, real-world social setting. And beyond that, Karoly says this pattern toward reduced alcohol consumption wasn't true for everyone in their study. In a minority of people, it actually led them to drink  more . \"This really highlights the fact that individual differences matter,\" she says. Another unanswered question centers on who's being studied. Most of the people in the Brown trial met the criteria for \"cannabis use disorder,\" and about 40% for alcohol use disorder. That could indicate their \"drug of choice\" was not necessarily alcohol in the first place, says  Rajita Sinha , a professor of psychiatry at Yale University. For people with problem drinking, cannabis  might  be a potential treatment, she says. This approach, on the other hand, \"may also be promoting more cannabis use and that would be problematic.\" \"Once you're in the throes of daily cannabis use, it's very hard to kick that habit,\" she says. Those involved in this work acknowledge the tension in this line of research. Cannabis doesn't carry the same risks of extreme harm as alcohol, which  is a leading cause  of preventable death in the U.S and kills more than 170,000 people a year. But Wardell says cannabis is clearly \"not a harm-free substance,\" either. While research on its effect has not kept up with its surging popularity, studies have shown marijuana can impair cognition and memory, trigger a serious gastrointestinal syndrome that causes nausea and vomiting, increase the risk of psychosis and other psychiatric illness, and impact relationships and social functioning. And Wardell says this latest study doesn't actually tell us whether the negative outcomes of alcohol are worse than cannabis in the long run. \"We would have to choose which one for a given individual might be less harmful and make sure that it's not inadvertently just replacing one problem with another,\" he says. In her role as a clinical psychologist, Metrik at Brown has seen     some patients with severe alcoholism who successfully stopped drinking with the help of cannabis, though some have then gone on to develop issues with that drug.   In her mind, the problem right now is that many people are relying on cannabis to treat their alcohol problems, without any guidance. \"We see this all the time, and we don't know what to tell them,\" she says. \"There's no clear messaging,\"  \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   Americans are drinking less alcohol these days, and more are trying marijuana. Now researchers are asking a provocative question - does cannabis actually help people drink less? NPR's Will Stone reports. WILL STONE, BYLINE: If you're envisioning study subjects smoking weed and sipping free booze, then you have a pretty good picture of this experiment. The team at Brown University recruited about 160 people who use cannabis and drink frequently. First, they smoked a joint, and then they had a few hours to drink. JANE METRIK: Essentially, they're in our simulated bar lab that we built specifically for the study. STONE: That's Jane Metrik, a psychologist at Brown who led the study. This lab bar was complete with beer taps and comfy places to sit. METRIK: We are watching, we're observing every time they take a sip. STONE: In fact, they took pains to make it feel close to real life. Metrik was even running around town to pick up everyone's beverage of choice. METRIK: We wanted to make sure that, when given the opportunity, you would be really driven to drink. STONE: They found people who smoked a cannabis joint that was about 7% THC ended up drinking about a third less afterward compared to when they had a placebo, which didn't get them high. The results were published today in the American Journal of Psychiatry. METRIK: It is an important signal that we're detecting. It is telling us that cannabinoids could play a potential therapeutic role in alcohol use disorder. STONE: Previous research has suggested cannabis could affect alcohol cravings and consumption. But Jeff Wardell, a psychologist at York University in Canada, says this randomized controlled trial offers some of the strongest data yet. JEFF WARDELL: This study really moves the field forward by helping to resolve one of the unresolved questions in the literature, which is, can cannabis actually have a real effect on alcohol? And it does look like, yes. STONE: Of course, there are some limitations here. No. 1, this was not your friend's party or a real bar where the subjects were getting stoned and drunk. WARDELL: And they're probably thinking to themselves, I don't know how much I really want to drink now because I don't want to get too, you know, blasted in front of these researchers, right? STONE: Also, the study was designed to look at the immediate effects. It's not clear whether this holds true in the long run. And there's tension here about the implications. Cannabis does not carry the same risk of extreme harm as excessive drinking, which kills more than 170,000 people in the U.S. every year. But Rajita Sinha, an addiction researcher at Yale University, says marijuana comes with its own problem. RAJITA SINHA: At the end of the day, there are harmful effects of cannabis. You know, it affects cognition, memory. It affects performance. STONE: It can trigger a GI syndrome with cycles of vomiting and nausea, increase the risk of psychosis, and it can be addictive. SINHA: Once you're in the throes of daily use, it's very hard to kick that habit. STONE: All that said, the reality is people are doing this. Just Google the term California sober, which has come to describe ditching alcohol in favor of cannabis. Hollis Karoly is a psychologist at the University of Colorado Anschutz, who also does this research. She became interested years ago while doing a study on alcoholism. Some people would tell her marijuana does help them. Others, not so much. HOLLIS KAROLY: People were reporting that, hey, cannabis gets in the way for me. Cannabis makes me want to drink more. I just find that really fascinating. Like, both can be true, right? STONE: For her part, Jane Metrik at Brown is cautious about how far to stretch these findings. METRIK: We're not quite ready to tell people who have alcohol use disorder, hey, go ahead and substitute cannabis, and, you know, it will work out for you. STONE: But she worries that many people are already doing this substitution without any clear guidance about whether it even works. Will Stone, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF DR.

If you've ever rented an apartment, bought a car or applied for a loan, you know what it is. It's a score that tells lenders how financially reliable you are and how good you are at paying off your debts. But it's so much more than that, too.  There are rules to the credit score game. They're just not so easy to find.  \"It really is a game of the less you know, the more the person that you owe can earn from you,\" says  Tiffany Aliche, also known as the Budgetnista.   For example, you've probably heard conflicting advice when it comes to your credit, like: You should pay off your credit card in full each month. And then, no, you shouldn't pay off your card in full each month, it's good to leave a little balance. Aliche says there are all kinds of mixed messages on purpose.   \"It's not in a creditor's best interest for you to know how to play the game, because if you know how to play the game, then they don't make any money,\" Aliche says.  But thankfully, Aliche says the rules aren't that hard to follow once you know what they are. Out of all the basic financial tenets (debt, budgeting, investing, insurance) Aliche says credit is the easiest to manipulate.  First, we give you some tricks and tips to boost your credit score. Then we'll give you a basic breakdown of how credit scores work.  \n       \n      Related Story:  'Tis The Season: Coping With SAD, Or Seasonal Affective Disorder \n       What is considered a good credit score?  There are lots of credit score calculators, but Aliche recommends focusing on your FICO score. \"If you have a decent FICO score, which is the typical score most lenders use, then your [other] scores will probably be good no matter what credit score system someone's using,\" she says. \"The FICO score ranges from 300, which is an F minus, minus, minus to 850, which is A plus, plus, plus, plus.\" And she says there's no point in trying to achieve an 850 if your score is 740 or above. \"You're likely to get a yes on most things that you ask for when it comes to your credit once you hit 740,\" she says. How can I improve my credit score? If you have no credit, little credit or bad credit, a parent, friend or family member (who pays their bills on time and has good credit) can do something to boost your credit score. They can add you to their credit card as an authorized user ... and you will inherit their good credit from that card.   \"Yes, you can inherit the good behavior, but you can also inherit the bad. So you want to make sure that you are an authorized user on someone who pays off every month in full,\" Aliche said.  This is Aliche's main credit score hack. \"Really the point of an authorized user was to give younger folks access to a card that they would not normally have access to. But we're not using it like that. We're just using it to boost their credit score.\"  Aliche's dad actually did this for her. If you want to add someone on as an authorized user, call your bank or credit card company  and ask to add an authorized user onto your credit card. Technically, you can give this authorized user access to your physical credit card, but Aliche recommends you not do that. Just add them as a user — with no card — to boost their credit score.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Your Technology Is Tracking You. Take These Steps For Better Online Privacy \n       Never get too close to your credit card spending limit Let's say your credit card company tells you you can have a credit card with a $100 spending limit. That's how much money you can borrow and spend. But ... you actually shouldn't spend that full amount. You shouldn't get even close to your $100 limit. You should spend much less. Just 30% of your spending limit, so $30.  If your credit card limit is $1,000, you can spend $300. If you spend more than 30% of your limit, that hurts your credit. So if you have a good credit score and you want to maintain it, spending 30% of your credit card limit is fine. If you have a $100 credit card limit and you only spend $30 each month, that keeps you at 30% utilization of your card, and the credit score people like that.  If you want to increase your credit score, though, you need to spend less than 30% of your spending limit. Only use $20 of your credit card limit. Or $15 (if your limit is $100). That shows the credit bureau that you don't need all of their credit. And for some reason, that makes your credit score go up.  If you do need to use your full credit card limit, one way to get around this is to pay your balance before your statement date. Your statement date is different from your payment due date. The statement date is the day that credit card companies notify the credit bureaus of your card usage. If you can beat them to the punch and pay off the card before it's reported, you can use more than 30% of your spending limit.  It can sometimes be hard to find your statement date, though. Aliche recommends you call your bank or credit card company directly and ask them what the statement date is.  \n       \n      Related Story:  6 Tips For Making A Career Change, From Someone Who Has Done It \n       Is it better for your credit to pay off your credit card in full each month or keep a small balance? \"Paying off a debt in full every single month is like fairy dust on your credit score. It's like you paid off a mortgage. It's like you paid off a car,\" Aliche says. It doesn't matter how  big or small your balance is. The credit bureau just likes to see that you pay off your balance, in full, every month. It's the habit that counts.  You might have heard it's good to keep a small balance, but Aliche says that's a misconception.  \"Only the credit card companies want you to keep a balance, because if you don't keep a balance, what are they going to charge you? There's no fees when you pay off in full.\"  What about asking for a credit limit increase? Can you ask for it? Will that hurt your score? When you ask for a credit limit increase, Aliche says, the credit card company will either do a \"hard inquiry\" or a \"soft inquiry.\" A \"hard inquiry\" is when you give someone permission to \"to see all of your grades and then they make a decision whether they want to lend to you.\" That inquiry can impact your credit score.  Before you ask for an increase, ask your credit card company if it's a hard inquiry. If it is, you need to ask yourself if it's worth the potential credit score hit. There's no way to know if you'll be approved for the increase, Aliche says, but if you have strong credit (740 or above), you're more likely to be approved.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Spend Savvier, Save Smarter: 5 Tips To Stop Stress-Spending \n       Now, here's some credit score 101:  What is my credit score composed of?  The five components that make up your credit score are:  Payment history  (35% of your credit score): This is the most important part of your credit score. Basically, payment history means what it sounds like: Do you pay the people you owe on time? This applies to school loans, credit cards, etc.  Amounts Owed  (30% of your credit score): Think of this as your spending limit. (This is the credit utilization we talked about above). You never want your credit card balance to be more than 30% of your spending limit.  Aliche says credit card companies have this little trigger that says, \" 'Danger, danger, danger, she's using too much of her card. She must be in financial trauma and turmoil.' And so that's why they punish you by bringing down your score [if you spend more than 30% of your credit limit]. Because if your score is low, guess what? You can't qualify for more debt. You see, they're literally slowing you down.\" So 30% is a new 100%. Length of Credit History  (15% of your credit score): The longer you've had credit, the stronger this part of your credit score will be. Keep your oldest credit card open and pay off a small, recurring bill each month on it and you shouldn't have to worry much about this 15%. New Credit  (10%): Each time you open a new line of credit (think: applying for a loan or new credit card), this 10% of your score is affected. You can lose points just by applying for a new credit card, so make sure you don't apply for new credit unless you really need it. Buying a car or trying to get approved for a rental is probably worth it. But is that fourth credit card worth it? Maybe not.  Credit Mix  (10%): You don't need to do anything for this component. Lenders just like to see that you have a mix of credit such as revolving credit like a credit card, and some installment credit loans, like a mortgage. \"They just like to see that you have a mix,\" Aliche says. \"The longer you live, the more of a mix you'll have.\"  What is not included in my credit score? The credit bureaus don't take into account your job, your income, how much money you have saved, your marital status or if you have children.  When should I start building credit?  Start building credit when you know you can manage it effectively. Only take out credit if you know you won't abuse it. Aliche says she would much rather someone not take out credit than to severely abuse it. \"The abuse of it is way more detrimental\" than having a \"thin file.\" How many lines of credit should I have?  Typically, if you're looking to buy a home, Aliche says a bank will look for about three lines of credit. \"So I guess if there was a sweet spot, it's that: three lines of credit,\" she says.  So that would be like a car payment, a credit card and a student loan. That's three lines of credit. And if you have five lines of credit that's not bad, Aliche says.  \"It's not necessarily bad if you're managing them well,\" she says. \"To me, between three and 10 is probably best. But honestly, why do you need more than five?\" Where can I find my credit score?  Some people can find a credit score through their online banking portal. You can  get your FICO score here.  You can also find your score through one of the major credit reporting agencies:  Experian ,  TransUnion , and  Equifax .  You can expect to see slightly different scores  depending on where you look . Here's more information about  how to find your score . This piece originally published on November 10, 2020.

Usually, I'm with a different NPR podcast called Planet Money. We're an economics show, so we tell stories about, like, where credit cards came from or about the two brothers who basically created the credit score. It was in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1874. And today, I'm here with LIFE KIT to talk a little bit more about credit scores. We dig into some practical tips when it comes to our own financial situations 'cause our credit scores, they're not just something that tells lenders how reliable we are. It's a game. TIFFANY ALICHE: You actually don't have to be as disciplined with credit. You just have to know the rules of the game and play within them. So when someone says, I'm good at everything else, but my credit is a hot mess, I'm like, woo-hoo. That's excellent because that's the one that you actually don't have to be Michael Jordan. (SOUNDBITE OF PODINGTON BEAR'S \"DREAMLINER\") GONZALEZ: That is Tiffany Aliche, better known as the Budgetnista. She teaches people how to be smart with their money. And here's the thing about the game of credit - the rules are not so easy to find. Like, you have probably heard conflicting ideas when it comes to your credit. Like, pay off your credit card in full every month and then, no, don't pay off your credit card in full every month. Leave a little balance. They like it. Tiffany says there are all kinds of mixed messages on purpose. ALICHE: It's not in a creditor's best interest for you to know how to play the game because if you know how to play the game, then they don't make any money. It really is a game of the less you know, the more the person that you owe can earn from you. GONZALEZ: But thankfully, Tiffany says the rules aren't that hard to follow once you know what they are. Out of all the basic financial tenets - debt, budgeting, investing, insurance - Tiffany says credit is the easiest to manipulate. ALICHE: There are literally some tips and tricks and hacks that are totally legal that if you employ them, (laughter) your credit score can jump like Jordan. GONZALEZ: So let's get those credit scores up, people. In this episode of LIFE KIT, the real rules of the credit score game. Hopefully, after listening, you'll be able to start boosting your credit score or at the very least, you'll be able to look at your credit score and know why it's that number. (SOUNDBITE OF PODINGTON BEAR'S \"DREAMLINER\") GONZALEZ: So let's just start at the very beginning. What is a credit score? ALICHE: So your credit score is basically your GPA - remember high school and college, your grade point average - on your ability to pay someone back that you owe. Just like your GPA, it is an average. People will say, hey, Tiffany, if I pay off this credit card, what's my credit score going to be? And I always say, I don't know because it's like asking me, if I get an A in Spanish, what's my GPA going to be? I don't know because what did you get in Spanish last year? What did you get in math? What did you get in science? Do you see? It's a collection of your financial grades, especially those over the last two years. GONZALEZ: I got my first credit card when I was 26 years old - very, very late. And I just kept thinking that I was doing the responsible thing. I was spending the money that I had. I wasn't going over. I wasn't borrowing. I was just, like, so responsible. And then when I did finally get my first credit card, I very quickly realized the perks of having a credit card and how, like, not having a credit card for all those years was actually hurting me in a lot of ways. ALICHE: Well, I'll say this. I rather someone not take out credit than to severely abuse it because the abuse of it is way more detrimental than, hey, your credit score is a little thin, so we're going to have to have other ways for you to prove you can pay us back than someone who was like, I owe $300,000 in credit card debt. I don't even know what I bought. GONZALEZ: Right. ALICHE: Credit is not good or bad. Credit is a tool. Think about what a hammer is able to do, build and destroy. Credit can be used certainly to help to build your financial life. But you can just as easily destroy your financial life with credit. So you didn't really start late. You started when you were meant to. GONZALEZ: So if you don't have that much credit because you're young, only take out a credit card if you know you won't abuse it because, otherwise, it can really hurt you long term. When should you start building your credit, though? ALICHE: If you are fortunate that you have, say, a parent that is fairly responsible, you can start as young as, you know, 18 years old. A parent, a grandma can put you on as an authorized user. And so that's how I started my credit journey. My dad had a credit card that he paid off every month in full. He added me on as an authorized user. And authorized user just means I am authorizing that my daughter can also use the card, although he did not issue me the card, which is a good idea. But what it meant was that as he used the card responsibly, it looked like we both used the card responsibly. But the caveat is, if he was irresponsible, then it also looked like we're both irresponsible. GONZALEZ: Wow. I didn't realize you could just, like, inherit your parents'... ALICHE: Yes. GONZALEZ: ...Good credit history like that. ALICHE: But yes, you can inherit the good behavior, but you can also inherit the bad. So you want to make sure that you are an authorized user on someone who pays off every month in full. GONZALEZ: Wow. This is the hack. ALICHE: Yes. So we're using it in a hack-y (ph) way. But really, the point of an authorized user was to give kind of like younger folks access to a card that they would not normally have access to. But we're not using it like that. We're just using it to boost their credit score. So you could give them a card. But like I said, I don't suggest that. GONZALEZ: I mean, this is a way to just, like, hand it down. I'm going to add a bunch of people to my credit cards. (LAUGHTER) ALICHE: Just be mindful. GONZALEZ: OK, so this is - brings us to another good question, which is just, like, what is the best way to build your credit? If you are young and you're trying to build your credit, are there, like, one or two things that you should absolutely do or not do? Like, what is the best way to to build your credit? ALICHE: I'll say this. One, let's focus on your FICO score. There are so many scores. There's, like, the VantageScore, the this score. But if you have a decent FICO score, which is the typical score most lenders use, then your scores will probably be good no matter what credit score system someone's using. FICO score ranges from 300, which is an F-minus-minus-minus to 850, which is an A-plus-plus-plus-plus. And there are five components to your FICO score. Payment history is the biggest component, and that's 35%. Your payment history is, do you pay the people what they owe? Do you pay the minimum or more? So when you're paying off in full every single month, your credit history is really getting a boost. GONZALEZ: And is that just, like, a rule, like, always? Is it never good to keep a small balance? Do credit cards or credit bureaus not like that? I remember - I feel like I was taught that the credit bureaus like you to have a small balance. ALICHE: You know who likes you to have small balance and who put that out there? They're so good at marketing - the credit card companies. GONZALEZ: (Laughter). ALICHE: Little - oh, Sarah, just keep a little balance. Why? Because they want you to pay interest. It literally does not help to have a balance. If you can pay off your credit card in full every month, that's magical and amazing. Only the credit card companies want you to keep a balance because if you don't keep a balance, what are they going to charge you? There's no fees when you pay off in full. GONZALEZ: Wow, did they pull one over on us. ALICHE: Yes (laughter). GONZALEZ: OK, so payment history, that's one component of your credit score - it's 35% of it. Back to the other components. ALICHE: Another 10% of your credit score is credit mix. That just means that you have some revolving debt, some installment loans. They just like to see that you have a mix. You don't need to do anything for that component 'cause it's only 10%. It's just the longer you live, the more of a mixture you'll have naturally. Fifteen percent of your score is a length of credit history. I tell people, look; if you have a credit card that you've been paying off, especially every month in full, keep your oldest credit card open. The longer you've had credit, the stronger this part of your credit score will be because they just like to see that you've had some history behind this, so that's 15%. Ten percent - new credit. That means every time you open up or you apply for a loan or new credit card, that's 10% of your score is affected. You can lose points just by applying. You will almost likely lose points if you apply even if you get denied. So you want to save those losing-points opportunity for times when you really need the thing. You need - you want to - you really need a car, you really want to get that house, you really want to - I don't know - get that apartment and they have to run your credit score. Understandable. GONZALEZ: And here's the last big component of your credit score. ALICHE: Thirty percent is amounts owed. That's something called utilization. So what is your limit versus what is your balance? You never want your balance to be more than 30% of your limit. So if you have $100 limit on your card, you don't want to swipe more than $30. You don't want to have a balance of more than $30 on that card. So utilization is your credit cards collectively but also individually. GONZALEZ: OK, spending limits is a big one. This is basically, like, even though your credit card company saying, here, your spending limit is $100 - that's how much you can spend and can have and can borrow - you actually shouldn't borrow that full amount. You shouldn't get even close to the limit. You should borrow much less - 30%, as you said - because if you do spend close to your limit, if you spend 90 or 100, that hurts your credit. Why? Like, why do they do this to us? Why do they say, here's your limit, but don't get anywhere near it? ALICHE: Credit card companies have, like, this internal mechanism when they're like, oh, Sarah over here, she got 90% use on this card, another 90% here. They have this little trigger that says beep, beep - danger, danger, danger. She's using too much of her card; she must be in financial trauma, in turmoil. And so that's why they punish you by bringing down your score because if your score is low, guess what? You can't qualify for more debt. You see? They're literally slowing you down. It's the emergency brake for credit card companies and lenders. Thirty percent is a new 100% if you want to just maintain - like, my credit score's in the 800s, so I can have around 30 and be good. If you want to increase your score, you actually have to use less than 30%. You're looking at losing, like, 20%, 15%, 10%. GONZALEZ: Wow. So if you want to maintain your current decent credit score, you can use 30% of your credit card limit. If you want to try to get that number to go up, you want to use 20%, 10%, 15%, something like that. So $15 of your $100-spending limit? ALICHE: I know. And so there's some hacks to that. So let's just say, like, you're buying a couch. And you're like, I know I'm going to have - I get paid next week. And I'm going to put this $300 couch on my $500 card. Fine. Pay off that couch in full before the statement date. The statement date is the date that they tell the credit bureaus, hey, Sarah used her card. So if you can beat them to the punch and pay off the card before it's reported being used, then you can certainly use more than the 30%. Do understand? GONZALEZ: OK, what if you have your $100 spending limit and you use that full $100, but you pay off the full balance before your payment is due? ALICHE: Well, it's not just... GONZALEZ: Then, it doesn't affect your credit score? ALICHE: No, not necessarily because... GONZALEZ: (Laughter). ALICHE: ...If you just wait to the due date, the due date and the statement date are two separate dates. The due date is when your payment is due. The statement date is the day that they've told the credit bureaus, basically, Sarah used her card. GONZALEZ: Oh. ALICHE: So your due date might be, say, the 20, but the statement date might be, say, the 11. So... GONZALEZ: (Gasps). ALICHE: Yes. GONZALEZ: I had no idea that these dates were different. ALICHE: Yes. GONZALEZ: OK. ALICHE: So a statement date is the date that they are acknowledging you used your card. So if you could pay it off before the statement date, then they won't even know you used your card. GONZALEZ: It doesn't hurt you, but it also doesn't necessarily reward you either. ALICHE: Exactly. It won't - it will show - 'cause I remember that I was trying to show, look at me, I'm so good at paying off my card. So I put my Netflix on it, and then I paid it off. Like, I would - like, Netflix would charge me, say, the 15, and I would pay it off on the 16. And I remember my score wasn't moving. And I called. I was like, how come my score's not moving? She's like, 'cause you're paying it off so quickly that we never got a chance to say you used your card. I was like, oh. So I found out - let me pay - Netflix charges my card on the 15. My statement date is the 20. So I started paying it off on the 21. So it's like, tell the people I used my card then I paid it off. You see? So if you don't want them to know, pay it off before. If you do want them to know, pay it off after the statement date. But always, always, always by the due date. GONZALEZ: Oh. OK, OK, OK. So if you do want the credit bureau to know that you swiped your credit card, then you buy whatever you want to buy. You stay within your limit, or you, like, hit your limit, you pay it off before your statement date. ALICHE: Correct. GONZALEZ: But if you want to try to increase your credit score, you need to wait until at least a day after your statement date. ALICHE: Yes - because paying off a debt in full every single month is like fairy dust on your credit score. It's like you paid off a mortgage. It's like you paid off a car note. Even though it was only $25, the amount didn't matter. It's the habit. GONZALEZ: OK. I mean, can we talk about how unfair the credit score system is... ALICHE: Yeah. GONZALEZ: ...And can be? Like, I mean basically, a credit score is supposed to determine how trustworthy you are. But there's a long history of factoring in gender and race in a way that hurts people of color, Black people. Also, it's just like, you know, if you had parents who put you on to to their credit card... ALICHE: Yes. GONZALEZ: ...So that you could start establishing your credit history when you're 18 and 19 and 20 versus if you didn't. ALICHE: Yes. In so many neighborhoods that adhere to people of color, you will see, instead of banks, check-cashing places. And there is not this emphasis on credit, you know - or on building good credit. And there are predatory companies like Rent-A-Center. I remember they were sued because of their predatory practices against people of color in the neighborhoods that they lived in. I don't - I think people think, well, if you just would work harder - that's [expletive]. Sorry for my language - but not sorry. It's not just about working harder because we know that women are paid less. How much harder do women have to work? GONZALEZ: Mmm hmm, right. What about asking for a credit limit increase? Is it good? Is it bad? Does it hurt you? Does it help you to ask to increase your credit card limit? ALICHE: So when you ask for a credit card increase, it can be a hard inquiry. A hard inquiry is when you give someone permission to look at your credit to see if you are worthy - credit worthy to be lent to. You want to ask that beforehand. I want to inquire about getting a credit card increase. Is this a hard inquiry? Not every - it's not a hard inquiry for everyone. And so many times, it is. And so you have to ask yourself, is it worth the potential score hit? Now, here's the thing. They get to decide how much the increase is going to be. You could certainly request. And there's no way to know for certain that you're going to get a yes. If your credit score is decent - and the beginning of perfect credit is 740. So 740 or better and you're likely to get a yes on most things that you ask for when it comes to your credit. GONZALEZ: How many lines of credit should you have? Is there a sweet spot? Can you have too many credit cards? Can you have too little? ALICHE: Typically, if you're looking to buy a home, they're usually looking for about three lines of credit. So I guess if there was a sweet spot, it's that. GONZALEZ: Three lines of credit. So that would be, like, a car payment, a credit card, student loans. Does that count as three lines of credit? ALICHE: Absolutely. GONZALEZ: OK. And if you have, like, five, is that bad? ALICHE: It's not necessarily bad if you're managing them well. To me, between three and 10 is probably best. But honestly, what do you need more with five, if you ask me. GONZALEZ: Tiffany, oh, my gosh. It has been so awesome talking to you. Thank you for all of the tips. ALICHE: Thank you, Sarah, for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GONZALEZ: So let's recap. Here is what you need to remember. Credit isn't good or bad - it's a tool. And take credit out when you know you won't abuse it. There are five components to your credit score. ALICHE: New credit, 10%; length of credit history, 15%; credit mix, 10%; amounts owed, 30%; payment history, 35%. GONZALEZ: The beginning of perfect credit is 740. So if your credit score is 740 or above, you really don't need to worry about getting it any higher. You're basically perfect. If you want to raise your credit score, though, ask someone with good credit to add you on to their credit card. Just make sure that that person makes all of their payments on time, or it will hurt you. And if you can - this is the magical pixie dust - pay off your own credit card in full every month. ALICHE: After the statement date and before the due date. GONZALEZ: You should actually call your credit card company and ask them what the official statement date is because it's not often spelled out. And last but not least... ALICHE: Credit is mostly a game. And it is a game that you can win once you know the rules, and now you know the rules. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GONZALEZ: For more episodes of LIFE KIT, go to /lifekit.

 What does 15 look like? Teens and former child actors weigh in online after Megyn Kelly comments \n         By Ivy Buck, Alina Edwards \n        \n           Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 5:59 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Former child actresses, as well as teenage girls around the country, have posted photos of themselves at 15 years old after journalist Megyn Kelly seemed to downplay the youth of Jeffrey Epstein's victims on her podcast. In a  discussion  with NewsNation host Batya Ungar-Sargon on \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" on Nov. 12, Kelly stated that she knows \"somebody very close to this case\" who \"told me from the start [...] that Jeffrey Epstein, in this person's view, was not a pedophile.\" \"He was into the barely legal type, like, he liked 15-year-old girls,\" Kelly continued. \"I'm not trying to make an excuse for this, I'm just giving you facts — that he wasn't into, like, 8-year-olds. But he liked the very young teen types that could pass for even younger than they were, but would look legal to a passer-by.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The age of consent in the United States ranges from 16 to 18 years old, depending on the state. It is not legal for an adult to engage in sexual activity with a girl below 16 years old in any U.S. state. NPR has reached out to Megyn Kelly for comment. NPR will update this story if we receive a response from Kelly. Women and girls react to Kelly online Many on social media were prompted to insist that 15 year olds are children. Actress and activist Cynthia Nixon weighed in on  Instagram : \"Megyn Kelly, I have a question for you, from one mother to another,\" she said. \"If Jeffrey Epstein were still alive, would you be comfortable with your teenage daughter being alone with him in his mansion? [...] And please, don't say 15 is barely legal. It is 100% illegal, and you know that.\" She was joined by celebrities who were former child actors, like Christina Ricci. On her Instagram story, Ricci posted, \"This woman is a danger to children.\" That Instagram story has since expired and is no longer online. Valerie Bertinelli, who starred in the sitcom  One Day at a Time,   shared  a picture of herself at 15, with the caption: \"This picture was taken in 1975. I'm 15. I'm a child. I'm gonna say this a little louder for those in the back row. I'm FIFTEEN. I'M A CHILD.\" She ended with a call to action, encouraging others to \"flood the Internet with pictures of all of us at 15.\" The Hollywood actresses were joined by actual teenagers, including a girl who posted a  TikTok video  from an account called @cheeringforchange and said her name is Eloise and that she is 14 years old.

On Tuesday, eight of them posted a \" national PSA ,\" which called for the release of all of the Epstein files. This was done in partnership with  World Without Exploitation , a national coalition of organizations working to end human trafficking. After showing photos of the women at ages 14 to 17, the video ends with a call for justice: \"It's time to bring the secrets out of the shadows. It's time to shine a light into the darkness.\" On World Without Exploitation's website, it urges Americans to call on members of Congress to vote for the Epstein Files Transparency Act: \"By mandating the release of these files—while safeguarding the privacy of survivors—the legislation seeks to shed light on the enablers, co-conspirators, and institutional protections that allowed Epstein's operation to flourish. It aims to close loopholes that obstruct justice and ensure that no one, regardless of wealth or power, is above the law.\" The response to Kelly's comments preceded the  nearly unanimous vote in the House of Representatives  to publicly release the full slate of the Department of Justice files on Epstein's child sex trafficking. The President,  in a reversal of position , had previously stated he would sign it if it passed the House and Senate.

How do you go from being an important person in someone's life to a complete stranger? Experts say it doesn't have to be all or nothing. If your relationship was healthy and ended on good terms, it’s possible to stay friends, acquaintances or somewhere in between. (However, if you were abused or felt unsafe in your relationship, keep your distance.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       “There may be reasons to be friendly, even if emotionally you’re not in a place where you can authentically dive head-first into a full-blown friendship,” says psychologist  Marisa Franco , author of  Platonic: How The Science of Attachment Can Help You Make — and Keep — Friends . To figure out your post-breakup dynamic, “really check in with yourself” about what you want the next phase of your relationship to look like, says therapist  Xavier Patschke , a psychotherapist with the Gender and Sexuality Therapy Center in New York. Patschke and Franco share three questions to ask yourself before building a platonic connection with a former romantic partner. Question 1: Why do I want to stay in touch with my ex? There are many practical reasons why former partners choose to stay in each other’s lives, say Franco and Patschke. Perhaps you share kids or pets together and need to maintain a civil relationship. Maybe you’re part of the same friend group or small community and know you’ll run into each other. Or maybe you were friends before you started dating and want to continue that friendship. Whatever the reason, be honest about your intentions. “You might realize you don’t actually want to be friends with them because they don’t look like the people you tend to want in your life platonically,” says Franco. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Question 2: Am I in a healthy place to stay in touch with my ex? If you’re reaching out to your ex because you still desire them and are hoping to get back together, “wait until those feelings subside,” says Franco. Same goes for if you’re struggling to accept the breakup and feel desperate to keep your former partner in your life, she says. You don’t want to treat friendship as a consolation prize. Franco knows that’s easier said than done. “It can feel like such a loss [for a partner] to go from one of the closest people in your world to not talking to them at all.” But keep in mind: it can be harder to get over your ex if you remain friends,  according to a study on post-breakup friendships . “You’re more likely to desire your ex romantically, and they’re more likely to desire you,” says Franco. So make sure you’re both ready for that next step. You’ll know you’ve reached an appropriate level of emotional distance when you want your ex to be happy regardless of whether or not their life includes you, says Franco. Question 3: What do I want a platonic relationship with my ex to look like? There’s a range of possibilities, says Franco. Do you want a close friendship that involves asking each other for dating advice? Does an occasional check-in feel more appropriate? Or would you settle on just being polite when you run into each other unexpectedly? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If there’s a mismatch between what you both want, respect the boundaries of the person who wants less intimacy. Just like a romantic relationship, you can’t force a connection. And if you’re not sure what’s appropriate, you can test out different levels of friendship. “It’s OK for the boundary to start at, ‘I don’t know if I want to hear about your future dates,’ “ says Patschke. “ ‘But we’ll try it and we’ll check in again.’ “ “The nice thing about being friends with anyone, including your ex, is that you can decide how close you want the friendship to be,” says Franco. “It’s not like romantic relationships where it’s very all or none.” We want to hear from you: Are you still friends with your ex?

\n        \n      \n\n         BOGOTA, Colombia — Few stories capture the magic of next year's  FIFA World Cup  quite like Curaçao—a small Caribbean nation that has defied history, geography, and every expectation to reach the biggest stage in global soccer. With 42 of the 48 spots to compete in the 2026 World Cup now filled, the tournament is already shaping up to be a historic one, with several other underdog nations defying the odds to play at the event jointly hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada next summer. While several major European, Africa and Asian soccer teams failed to qualify, including Nigeria, China, India, Greece, Serbia, and Hungary, multiple small nations have made global headlines by securing their place in next summer's competition, some for the first time. From Curaçao to Cape Verde, here is a look at some of the minnows who have earned a spot in the 2026 World Cup Curaçao Until now, the tiny Caribbean nation of Curaçao was better known for its turquoise-blue liqueur and sun-soaked beaches than for its soccer feats. But after drawing 0–0 with Jamaica on Tuesday, the former Dutch colony set a historic record by becoming the least populous country ever to reach the FIFA World Cup. Home to roughly  150,000  people and located in the southern Caribbean just off the coast of Venezuela— it has surpassed Iceland as the smallest country to compete in the world's most prestigious soccer tournament. As a point of comparison, the World Cup final next summer will be played at the  MetLife stadium in New Jersey , which has a capacity of 82,500 – more than half of Curaçao's population. To overcome the limitations of having a small population, Curaçao, a Dutch Caribbean nation, has mostly recruited players born in the Netherlands for its World Cup squad. The country became an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 2010 following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. \"Curaçao, like quite a few examples of smaller nations, have been good at tapping into the diaspora, ringing anyone who might have a distant relative connected to their country,\" explained Carl Worswick, an independent sports journalist and soccer specialist. Haiti Another underdog to reach the international tournament is Haiti, which has qualified for the first time since 1974, despite a raft of obstacles at home; the Caribbean nation is facing an acute security and humanitarian crisis which has impacted every sector of society, including football players. \"They've been living the crisis in full scale… They haven't been able to train or play in Haiti for years because of the gang violence,\" said Harold Isaac, a Haitian journalist based in Port-au-Prince. Haiti's coach since 2024, Frenchman Sebastien Migne, has never been to the country, where gangs control 90% of the capital city Port-au-Prince. Given the turmoil that many Haitians live with, the World Cup qualification has been a glimmer of hope, according to Isaac: \"This really came as a kind of unimaginable boon, morally, for the country.\" Cape Verde Cape Verde, a small Atlantic archipelago off the coast of West Africa, qualified for the World Cup for the first time last month when it beat the southern African nation of Eswatini 3-0. Before Curaçao qualified, Cape Verde had been the second-least populous country to reach the World Cup, with a population of roughly 600,000. The former Portuguese colony has also recruited from its diaspora, with its team notably featuring Center-back Roberto Lopes, who was born in Ireland to an Irish mother and Cape Verdean father. Panama Another small nation, Panama, will be making a return to the World Cup after its 2018 debut at the tournament. The Central American nation of four and a half million people beat El Salvador Tuesday to earn its place in the competition. In 2018, Panama finished at the bottom of its group with zero points and will now have a chance at redemption. A key reason that several small nations in the Americas have qualified for the tournament is because Canada, Mexico and the U.S. are hosting it. As hosts, these countries automatically qualify, leaving more room for other nations in the ﻿﻿﻿Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football to win a spot. What's next for the minnows? While social media is flooded with videos of street parties and parades as countries celebrate their qualifications, the road to the World Cup is still long. \"I think everyone assumes that, brilliant, this can only be a good thing… but there is a lesson to be learned, it's not always positive,\" said soccer expert Worswick. He stressed the importance of national Football Associations investing funds into their players and teams, citing high-profile scandals that have marred some countries' World Cup debuts. Worswick explained that while qualifying for the World Cup puts a country on the map, it often also brings complicated issues surrounding team finances, preparation, and pressure at home. But for countries like Haiti, just qualifying may be enough: \"The people are suffering and they've been suffering for years,\" says Isaac, \"and they're just asking for hope, and this is what the team brought them.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"Tiny Desk Carousel: Featured Concerts on Home Page","category":"Special Interest / Other","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The home page of a media platform features a weekly Tiny Desk Carousel, showcasing a collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts on Wednesdays at 2:20 PM EST.

The sale of the 1940 painting, called  El sueño (La cama) , is widely anticipated to set a record for the most expensive artwork made by a woman. \" El sueño  stands among Frida Kahlo's greatest masterworks — a rare and striking example of her most surrealist impulses,\" said Anna Di Stasi, Sotheby's head of Latin American art, in a statement. \"Kahlo fuses dream imagery and symbolic precision with unmatched emotional intensity, creating a work that is at once deeply personal and universally resonant.\" Sotheby's estimates that  El sueño (La cama)  will sell for between $40 and $60 million. The final price could easily outstrip the 2014 record set by Kahlo's friend and contemporary Georgia O'Keeffe, when O'Keeffe's 1932 work  Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1  sold at auction for $44.4 million. The last time Frida Kahlo broke an auction record was in 2021, when her 1949 work  Diego y yo  sold for $34.9 million; then the highest price for a Latin American artwork. It is also Kahlo's highest sale to date. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At a moment when art sales have dramatically softened,  museums face massive financial restructuring  and a number of leading galleries have shuttered, the buzz around this painting is significant but not surprising. Surrealist women artists are currently  in vogue among collectors , and Kahlo is among a small handful of superstar artists with a seemingly bulletproof brand — think Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Gustav Klimt. A Klimt painting auctioned by Sotheby's on Tuesday sold for $236.4 million, making it the second-most expensive painting ever auctioned. Kahlo's mystique erupts in part from her psychologically complex self-portraits that focus on her disabilities, her politics, her heritage and her deep connection to the world shimmering around her. \"Her paintings tell stories — intimate, engaging, terrifying and tragic ones,\" wrote art historian Sharyn R. Udall in her 2003 article,  \"Frida Kahlo's Mexican Body: History, Identity and Artistic Aspiration,\"  published in  Woman's Art Journal.  \"When Kahlo looked into death's dark mirror, she saw herself. In the act of painting and in the resulting canvases, she documented her own attempts to survive pain, to make sense of it, to act out through images layered with irony, fantasy and allegory. Her work is searingly candid, overlaid with the unreality of an endless nightmare.\" And her work seems to only grow in power. Just within the past year, more than a dozen museums around the world exhibited shows dedicated to Kahlo. An  immersive experience  that brought audiences inside some of them has been traveling internationally. The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston will soon open a vast retrospective called  Frida: The Making of an Icon.  It's scheduled to transfer to the Tate Modern in London next June. And a new Frida Kahlo museum that explores the artist's early life opened in Kahlo's neighborhood in Mexico City in September. It's the third museum that centers Kahlo's life and art in the city. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1196979026","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-10","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00+00:00","title":"Human Rights and Immigration Detention: Progress and Challenges in 2024","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses recent developments in immigration detention practices and their alignment with international human rights standards.

Negotiation skills aren't just for high-stakes situations like job offers and pay raises. They can be used in daily life, like figuring out where you and your friends should go on vacation or what you and your partner should cook for dinner tonight. They can also help you get what you want and make decisions with more confidence, says  Joan Moon , a career coach and the head of negotiation coaching at the Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Collaboratory at the Harvard Kennedy School. \"They can improve your satisfaction with your situation and give you a sense that you are making intentional choices.\"  Moon explains four classic negotiation tactics often used in business environments — and how they can be applied in everyday circumstances.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Oops, I messed up! 7 common public speaking issues — and how to fix them \n       The tactic: Benchmarking  How to use it in everyday life: When making big consumer choices, like hiring a contractor to renovate your kitchen, buying a car or purchasing a new washing machine.  How it works:  This strategy allows you to gather the information you need to make a fair decision. It's when you compare an offer to market standards and best practices, \"then figure out where you lie within that range\" to get an optimal deal. In business, people often use benchmarking in salary negotiations to ensure they're being paid equitably, says Moon.  The tactic: Win-win strategy  How to use it in everyday life: When you're trying to find a solution to a problem that makes everyone happy, like picking out a place to eat or haggling for a good price at a yard sale.  How it works:  This helps different parties find one solution that's in everyone's interest. You might see this in business contracts or labor agreements, for example. Parties won't sign until the terms are mutually beneficial.  Try this when you want the other party to not just agree with your decision, but feel good about it. Moon shares a recent personal experience. Her phone line was down so she called her phone company to get reconnected — but the customer service agents were unhelpful. She could feel herself getting upset, so she decided to reframe her request using a win-win strategy.  She said: \"Listen, I've been with this company for 10 years and I would like to keep doing so for another 10 years. Can we focus on a solution?\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  3 common thinking traps and how to avoid them, according to a Yale psychologist \n       The approach worked, she says. The company didn't want to lose a loyal customer — and Moon wanted her phone fixed.  The tactic: A menu of options   How to use it in everyday life: When you want to get something done and won't take no for an answer.  How it works:  This approach avoids requests that result in a flat-out no answer. People often use this tactic when negotiating the benefits of a job offer, says Moon. For example, instead of asking for more flexibility at a new job and getting rejected, you might propose a couple of options: working three days remote or a four-day workweek, expanding the possibility of a favorable outcome.   Offer \"a menu of options\" to someone if they think only one solution is possible. Let's say you're upset with your roommate for being messy, says Moon. Instead of asking them to clean up (which they haven't been doing), give them choices: hire a housekeeper, change the breakdown of responsibilities at home or adjust the cleaning schedule. \"When you present options, it signals to the other person: let's solve this problem together,\" says Moon.  \n       \n      Related Story:  The rules of improv can make you funnier. They can also make you more confident. \n       The tactic: Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement  How to use it in everyday life: When you know you're not likely going to get the outcome you want, so you create a plan that helps you avoid a total-lose situation. For example, when you're planning a trip with friends who want to go on a tropical vacation, but you want to go to a big city. Maybe you settle on Miami!  How it works:  Negotiators use  BATNA  to come up with a backup plan when their desired outcome isn't possible. It helps avoid a total win-lose situation and shows the person you're negotiating with that you have a strong alternative, which can increase your leverage in a situation. You might use BATNA when comparing job offers with unfavorable conditions. For example, one job requires you to relocate your family to another state, while the other job pays less but is local. Your BATNA might be to tell both jobs that you will stay at your current gig and unless they can offer something better.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. Hey everybody, it's Marielle. When was the last time you negotiated something? Not your salary, though. Well, think about it this way. Have you ever compromised with a friend or a housemate, partner or family member? If so, you have done some form of negotiation, whether it was over who's going to do the dishes, what you were having for dinner or where you were going to go on vacation together. JOAN MOON: I had some friends the other day, a couple deciding on what - (laughter) what ice cream flavors that they were going to get from the grocery store. SEGARRA: That's Joan Moon, founder of Moon Negotiation, a negotiation and career coaching firm. She's also the head of negotiation coaching at the Harvard Kennedy School. And she says, yeah, some negotiations are much higher stakes than others. But the point is, negotiating can help you come up with compromises, creative solutions that go beyond yes or no, this or that, and that can help you get unstuck. MOON: It can really improve your everyday contentment, your satisfaction with your situation, and it can really give you a sense of agency. It gives you a sense that you are making intentional choices and creating a life for yourself, curating a life for yourself that you're happy with. SEGARRA: On this episode of LIFE KIT, Joan and I are going to walk through some of the negotiation strategies that you might typically use when you get a job offer or a promotion, and talk about how you can apply those in your day-to-day lives. Well, let's get into some of the formal negotiation tactics that you can use in these everyday situations. There is a term that's going to come up here - benchmarking. What is that? MOON: Yeah. So what we do in, let's say, a job offer or a salary negotiation is we benchmark on, like, what is an appropriate range for this job. We might look at what the industry standards are, what the organizational standards are. Might do some research on the fair market value. And then using my level of experience, I'll figure out where I lie within that range. In the personal context, you can continue to use those benchmarking strategies, let's say, when you're making, like, large consumer choices. So if you're hiring a plumber or you want to do a kitchen renovation. Or other times you might do some benchmarking is buying a car, right? So what you're doing is you're researching good information and what is an appropriate price point for this purchase. And it's really important to reduce ambiguity and uncertainty in these situations by investigating. When you investigate, I go with APP. So A is ask, P is to think of people resources and the other P is to think of paper resources. So you had a delayed flight, and you know that there are certain regulations that airlines have to follow. You might be able to just ask at the customer service counter, and they might give you the information you're looking for. For people resources - so people resources might be just asking around within your networks. You can go into informal groups like a Facebook group. You can reduce the ambiguity by investigating using the APP model. SEGARRA: It sounds like benchmarking works really well for negotiations in the office and then also on things that you're buying. Stuff around money. MOON: Yeah. SEGARRA: Let's talk about another phrase. What about win-win strategies? MOON: Yeah. Most people have heard of, like, a win-win in passing, but the issue is that a lot of us are not utilizing the strategy as frequently as we have the opportunity to. So, a win-win is when you talk about how you and I are both going to benefit from the solution. So let me give you an example. I was on a customer service call recently, and I was having issues with my phone service, and I was in a really tight spot. I basically had no phone service. My phone number wasn't working. So I called customer service and I said, you know, you told me to do this thing and that if I did that, this situation would be fixed. The new customer service rep I was talking to said, well, you know, we don't have any record of us telling you that we told you to do that. And I was incredibly upset because, A, you're gaslighting me right now. B, you literally have a recording of this call and you can look it up. Like, what is the point of this, right? So I was sitting there fuming that that is the direction of the conversation that we went in. And so I said, OK, Joan, you know the research on this. Let's utilize this win-win framing strategy. And so I redirected the conversation saying, listen, I want to remain a long-time satisfied customer at this company. I've been with you for 10 years, and I would like to keep it for another 10 years. And so what I'm doing is I'm speaking to their interests and to mine. Right? We both want to benefit from this relationship. So I said, can we focus on a solution to how I can get my phone reconnected? And with this, we were able to focus on solutions instead of focusing on the past and whether or not they told me that, you know, because that was not going to be a productive conversation. So we focused on what do we both want in this situation and how do we benefit from that. SEGARRA: You've also talked about when, you're in the midst of negotiating, giving people a menu of options. What does that mean? MOON: In going to a housekeeping example - right? - let's say you're upset with your roommate on people not cleaning up around the apartment and, you know, it's getting pretty filthy. And, you know, I've gotten so busy with work, so I can't keep on doing the majority of the housework. So what I would recommend is come up with three different options. Let's say maybe we come up with a different cleaning schedule that is a little bit more accommodating of our lifestyles. Or maybe we change the breakdown of responsibilities within the home. Or maybe we look up prices of housekeeping services. When you present three different options, it's less of a standoff, and it signals to the other person a collaborative tone - like, let's solve this problem together. SEGARRA: Yeah. And I know, you know, on the one hand, if you're the one bringing this up, like, then maybe it is on you to come up with some solutions. But is it ever frustrating, though, to be the person who is like, and here it is, here's a menu of things you could choose from... MOON: (Laughter). SEGARRA: ...And it just feels like the other person is not doing any of the work? MOON: Yeah. Yeah, so I do not promise that this will be a frustration-free process, right? And when someone is being incredibly, you know, stubborn or difficult, that's when I recommend reconsidering what we call in the negotiation community, your BATNA. And that stands for best alternative to negotiated agreement. And what that means is if you're unable to negotiate with this person, what are you going to walk away to? What is your alternative? SEGARRA: What's your backup plan? MOON: Yeah, exactly. And if you have a really bad backup plan that you're not really willing to consider, then you're going to feel stuck, and then you're going to get upset with the other person for not engaging in these options. You're going to feel like you're stuck in a corner. And so what we always recommend in negotiating is to strengthen your BATNA - have a really good alternative. When you increase and improve upon your alternatives, you're able to think with a clearer head, and you're less likely to make a decision that you regret later on. SEGARRA: I wonder, is it important for the other person to have a sense of your BATNA, like, especially if you've firmed it up or if you are willing to walk away? If you're willing to move out or leave your job or, you know, break up with your partner... MOON: (Laughter) Yeah. SEGARRA: ...or whatever, like, is it good for them to know that? Should you communicate that with them in the negotiation? MOON: That's a really great question. Yes, absolutely. And I want to be super clear. You do want to signal to them subtly that you do have a strong BATNA so that they are aware of, you know, how fed up you might be. Oftentimes, people are so involved in their own lives, and what you're bringing up to them might not be a big priority for them. But it might become a higher priority when they realize, oh, my gosh, I didn't realize you were so upset about this. I didn't realize that you were at the breaking point when it comes to this. And so when you are able to subtly signal, like, listen, I'm close to my breaking point here, then they are going to prioritize the requests that you are making to them. SEGARRA: Or not. And then you... MOON: (Laughter) Yes. SEGARRA: And then you, you know, make another choice. Then you maybe... MOON: Absolutely. SEGARRA: ...Fall back on your backup plan. I mean, if your BATNA, like we talked about, best alternative to a negotiated agreement, is real - like, if you really feel that, then you will embody that, I think, when you're in the room, and you won't be coming from a desperate place. MOON: Actually, Marielle, there's research that shows exactly what you're saying, right? So there's research that shows that when you have a strong BATNA, it influences your negotiation performance. If you don't have a strong BATNA, it impacts the way that you engage in the negotiation and the sort of feeling like you're in a corner, you don't have any other options. That kind of subtly bleeds through to the other person, and so you end up getting a worse negotiating outcome. So having a strong BATNA is good for multiple reasons, the first one being that you have alternatives if this doesn't work out, but the second reason is that it puts you in a healthy and strong psychological place as you enter into that conversation. SEGARRA: Yeah. So you're not coming in as a supplicant? MOON: Yes. Exactly. SEGARRA: Let's talk about some other examples of how we can negotiate in our day-to-day lives. Like, what are some other negotiations that might come up, for instance, with a romantic partner? MOON: So one example that I think will feel really relatable for folks is I had a client, I'm going to call her Anna, and Anna was negotiating with her fiance over the details of their wedding. And, you know, he wasn't super invested in the details at first. You know, he was like, oh, yeah, whatever you want. Oh, that sounds like a great idea. Sounds good. Let's do that. But there was a shift at a certain point where he started being a little bit more demanding and rigid on some of the details that he previously didn't care about. So when she dug a little deeper, she found out that it was actually his mother who had some expectations. SEGARRA: How did I know you were going to say that? (LAUGHTER) MOON: It's such a classic... SEGARRA: How did I know, Joan? MOON: ...Story, right? Such a classic story. So - sorry to give such a heteronormative example, too. So what happened is the mother had been dreaming about - this is her eldest son. She'd been dreaming about this wedding for so long, and she also had certain cultural expectations, right? Anna and her fiance, they were coming from two different cultural backgrounds, and in addition to that, there was a language barrier. She couldn't communicate effectively directly with the mother. And I use this example to talk about the different parties involved in a negotiation. I call them the PDMs. The P is a power broker, the D is a decision-maker, and the M is a messenger. Now, normally you would think that Anna and her fiance are the decision-makers, but as she dug deeper, she realized that he was actually just kind of a messenger and the mother was being the decision-maker. So what she did in this situation was appeal to the father-in-law, who was a power broker. He's the one who could sort of influence his wife and say, listen, you know, it's her wedding, too. Maybe, you know, she doesn't understand why this is of cultural significance to you. Maybe you should explain this. And so he was able to influence her a little bit more. And this scenario is to point out that there are often invisible parties in a negotiation. Oftentimes, you're not just negotiating with the person in the room, so really thinking about who are the actual parties involved and who are the power brokers, decision-makers and the messengers can be important in how you direct your energy during a negotiation. SEGARRA: That's so smart, and it also is annoying. MOON: (Laughter) Yeah. SEGARRA: It's just like, what if you don't want to have a decision-maker outside of the people that you thought were decision-makers in your romantic relationship? MOON: Absolutely. And I think that's a conversation between Anna and her fiance, right? Like, hey, let's talk about whose wedding this is. Let's talk about what kind of decisions we're OK with delegating to family members and what decisions that we need to make between ourselves. And that's a negotiation in itself. SEGARRA: Yeah. What are some things you might negotiate with friends, besides housework, if you're roommates? MOON: So I have an example of two friends who were having an argument or a disagreement. One friend was sort of feeling undervalued and kind of ignored by the other friend. You know, maybe they weren't responding to their texts as frequently, when they were in group settings, they weren't really prioritizing time with them, and so in this situation, she was debating on, like, how do I approach this conversation? It's like, first of all, let's go back to the shared interests example, right? I care about our relationship, and I want us to have a healthy friendship, and so starting off the conversation with that sets a collaborative tone. Another thing to think about as you engage in negotiating or engaging in conflict resolution is something I borrowed from Alcoholics Anonymous. It's called HALT - hungry, angry, lonely or tired. Anytime you're feeling any of these things, it's probably a bad time to engage in this conversation. We really want to be mindful about the timing and context of a situation, and is that the ideal scenario in which we're going to engage in a conversation that's really important to us? So being really intentional about not only is the timing and context right for you, but is it the right timing and context for the other person and being really thoughtful about them, and that sets you up to have a more productive and successful conversation. SEGARRA: Yeah. OK. Broadly speaking, how do you know when it's time to step away from a negotiation? MOON: Oh, I get this question a lot, actually. So one major factor to consider is the strength and the longevity of a relationship. And let's say if you are haggling over the price of a souvenir and you're never going to see this vendor again, you might want to cut your losses and walk away. If this is a long-standing relationship that you really value and you really want to maintain, you want to make sure that how you negotiate and how frequently you negotiate isn't wearing out or fatiguing that relationship. You know, you want to consider, like, am I overfatiguing this relationship? Am I overplaying my hand? And do I need to sort of accept the no or not right now and walk away from this situation to my BATNA? SEGARRA: Yeah. What would you say to someone who's nervous about looking demanding or even greedy when they negotiate? MOON: This brings me back to the strategy of benchmarking because when you benchmark and you realize that what you're asking for is completely within the norm, then what you've done is you've built yourself an armor against a reaction like that. And you're also - once you have that data and you present that data to the other person, you reduce the likelihood that they're going to respond that way because you have objective data, right? You have all these numbers that you've researched, and it's kind of hard to react that way when there's such clear data in front of you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: That was Joan Moon from Moon Negotiation. Now, instead of doing a traditional recap, let's go over the terms and acronyms Joan introduced us to. Basically, this is a glossary. First, we've got benchmarking. MOON: So benchmarking is when you do some research to see what are the standards out there, what other objective data that you can collect to legitimize what you're asking for. SEGARRA: Next up, we have the acronym APP. MOON: APP is three different areas in how you can investigate and reduce ambiguity. So the A stands for ask, whether that's directly or indirectly. The first P is for people resources, and then there's paper resources. SEGARRA: And these don't literally have to be on paper. You know, this could mean doing your research by looking up a policy or digging through an online forum. Next, Joan talked to us about win-win strategies. MOON: A win-win strategy is when you highlight what you're asking for can benefit both parties, whether it's you and the other person or you and your employer. SEGARRA: Another negotiation tactic Joan mentioned - giving people a menu of options. MOON: A menu of options is a way to stay away from yes-or-no requests and instead to present three different creative choices so that it increases the likelihood of the other person agreeing on one of those options. SEGARRA: All right, another acronym coming your way - BATNA. That's B-A-T-N-A. MOON: The BATNA is the best alternative to negotiated agreement. And this is, you know, if your negotiation doesn't work out, what are you going to walk away to? What is your best alternative in this scenario? SEGARRA: Next, we've got PDMs. MOON: The PDMs are the power brokers, decision-makers and the messengers. There are three different types of parties that you might be negotiating with, whether they're in the room with you or outside of the room. SEGARRA: And our last acronym - HALT. H-A-L-T. MOON: HALT stands for hungry, angry, lonely and tired. And basically you want to halt when you are feeling any of these things because it's likely not the best time to engage in a negotiation conversation. SEGARRA: All right, Joan, thank you so much for being here. MOON: Thank you, Marielle, for having me. I'm a big fan of the show. SEGARRA: I'm a big fan of yours now.

Greg Abbott has quickly appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling that the redistricting passed by lawmakers at the urging of President Trump was based on racial gerrymandering. \"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\" A three-judge panel had earlier Tuesday placed a temporary block on the map that Republican lawmakers passed this summer and ordered the state to use the district maps from the last two elections. The map that was overruled had been drawn to give Republicans an advantage in flipping as many as five House seats held by Democrats.  \"To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map,\" wrote the majority from a three-judge panel. The panel  heard a trial   on the case  in October. The plaintiffs included several civil rights groups and individuals. The ruling is a blow to Trump and the Republicans in a  nationwide redistricting race  that  began in Texas  this summer. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, also said he would appeal the ruling on the \"Big Beautiful Map\" which he called \"entirely legal\" in a statement. Democrats praised the court ruling. \"Race was always a driving factor and a driving factor to make it harder for minority Texans,\" said Texas Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher in an interview. \"This map was drawn to make it harder for them to have an impact in elections.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The court's decision, in a 2-1 ruling, comes at a pivotal moment. Around the country, Trump is pressing Republican state lawmakers to reshape congressional voting maps to hold the party's slim majority in the House and support his agenda. Using their heavy Republican majority in the legislature, Texas lawmakers passed a map in August designed to help their party grow its ranks in the 2026 elections for the U.S. House. The process gained national attention when Democrats in the legislature  fled the state for over  two weeks to delay a vote and Republican leaders threatened to arrest them. Democrats argued the new map weakened the voting power of Latino and Black communities. The redistricting in Texas also prompted California Democrats to act. This month  California voters passed  an initiative allowing redistricting that could help Democrats win five seats in that state. Was it partisan gerrymandering or racial gerrymandering?  Republicans in the Texas Legislature  passed the map saying  it was designed to improve their party's chances of winning five congressional seats. They noted that, unlike in some states, the law in Texas does not prohibit redistricting for partisan advantage and that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal courts could not intervene when it's done. But partisan gerrymandering can often overlap with racial gerrymandering, which is illegal. Opponents of the map argued in court  that it intentionally diminished  the voting power of minority communities.  The 160-page opinion was written by District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown, who was appointed by Trump during his first term as president. His ruling drew upon statements and contradictions in what Republican lawmakers said as the maps were passed. A letter the Department of Justice wrote to encourage the redistricting ended up being grounds the court used to block the effort. The judges noted that when Gov. Abbott originally called lawmakers into session to draw the map,  he cited a letter from Justice Department  officials criticizing districts that had majority nonwhite voting populations as \"racial gerrymanders.\" In other words, the letter implied the districts as they stood gave non-white voters an advantage and that had to be reversed. Eventually, Texas Republicans said the map was not intended to correct for a racial tilt but for partisan gain. That letter put lawmakers, who for years had denied their use of race when making maps, in \"a difficult spot,\" according to University of Texas at Austin political scientist Josh Blank, because they were \"ultimately saying opposite things.\" Brown's ruling criticized the construction of the letter itself, which was sent by Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"It's challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors,\" Brown wrote. \"This decision is a rebuke of Donald Trump and to some degree a rebuke of lawmakers in Texas,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist with the University of Houston. \"They think the process was flawed and the Department of Justice was not credible in their legal arguments.\" Rep. Gene Wu, Democratic leader in the Texas House, said Tuesday's ruling shows the courts still hold true to American principles. \"The striking down of the maps is fundamentally a sign that the courts still believe in the core principles of this country: That one man, one vote idea is something that is absolute and must be kept up,\" Wu said. Around the country,  Republicans have more options for redistricting  seats their way than Democrats do, in part because the GOP controls more state legislatures. Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade after the national census. At the behest of Trump, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina passed new maps that could help the GOP win a seat in each state. Ohio drew a map that analysts say gives Republicans a slight advantage in a few seats. For Democrats, in addition to the five seats that could be gained in California, a court-ordered redistricting in Utah could help Democrats win a seat there. And Virginia Democrats have started a process that could yield two seats in that state. Blaise Gainey  covers state politics for The Texas Newsroom.

Here's the thing:  Goo Goo Dolls  songs endure. Formed almost four decades ago, the rock band's artistic ambition has always been connection — pop anthems that can be blasted from car speakers and in karaoke bars, and sung en masse. These songs stick around, but never wear out their welcome. This set is bookended by songs from  Dizzy Up the Girl , the 1998 album that found the sweet spot between catchy arena rockers and heartfelt power ballads. \"Slide\" is particularly suited to the space as John Rzeznik's voice, which has aged gracefully into the velvet rasp he's known for, rings clearly across the song's careening melody. \"Feel the Silence\" is a sturdy and perhaps little-known gem from 2006's  Let Love In . \"Not Goodbye (Close My Eyes),\" too, is a meditative ballad waiting to find more ears. But how could Goo Goo Dolls not close with \"Iris\"? Originally written for the  City of Angels  soundtrack, revived by  Deadpool & Wolverine  and consistently discovered by listeners seen by its romantic melodrama, \"Iris\" has returned from the brink of winking irony and been once again embraced for its desperate sincerity.

      3 massive changes you'll see as the climate careens toward tipping points \n         By Rebecca Hersher, Lauren Sommer \n        \n           Wednesday, November 19, 2025 • 5:05 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         World leaders are heading into the final days of COP30, the United Nations climate meeting in Brazil. They are trying to agree on how to curb global warming and pay for the costs of an increasingly hotter planet. For the past  eight years , one of the primary objectives of the annual negotiations has been to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to the temperatures in the late 1800s. That temperature goal was established after a landmark international scientific report laid out the catastrophic effects of exceeding that amount of warming. But that goal is no longer plausible, scientists say. Humanity has not cut planet-warming pollution quickly enough, and the planet will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, likely in the next decade, according to a  recent United Nations report . However, all is not lost. If countries can cut overall greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2035, scientists say the planet would quickly return to lower levels of warming. \"We must move much, much faster on both reductions of emissions and strengthening resilience,\" U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell told world leaders at COP30. Right now, countries are pursuing policies that would cut emissions by just 12% by 2035. \"The science is clear: We can and must bring temperatures back down to 1.5 [degrees Celsius] after any temporary overshoot,\" Stiell said. If countries follow through on current promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the latest estimates suggest that Earth's temperature will  top out  around 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming this century. The latest science also makes clear the profound human costs of exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, even temporarily. The planet has warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius, according to the  World Meteorological Organization . And communities are already experiencing more dangerous storms, flooding and heat waves. When the  planet heats up beyond 1.5 degrees , the impacts don't get just slightly worse. Scientists warn that massive, self-reinforcing changes could be set off, having devastating impacts around the world. Such changes are sometimes called climate tipping points, although they're not as abrupt as that term would suggest. Most will unfold over the course of decades. Some could take centuries. Some may be partially reversible. But they all have enormous and lasting implications for humans, plants and animals on Earth. And every tenth of a degree of warming makes these tipping points more likely, according to a  new report  from 160 international climate researchers. Here are the three most important and well-studied changes, from collapsing ice sheets to thawing Arctic permafrost, to disappearing coral reefs. Change No. 1: Coral reefs could be gone forever For coral reefs, the tipping point may have already begun. Widespread coral die-offs have been seen around the globe as ocean temperatures heat up, making it the first domino to fall, according to a  new report . By overall area, coral reefs are a tiny part of the ocean. But they're a bedrock ecosystem for marine life, supporting an estimated 25% of all species. Corals are highly sensitive to heat. When marine heat waves hit, corals come under stress, and they expel the algae that live inside them and that they need to survive. The reefs then turn a ghostly white color. A bleaching event doesn't necessarily mean the end for a coral reef. Corals have the ability to recover, given enough time. But repeated heat waves, as seen at  Australia's Great Barrier Reef  and  off the coast of Florida , can kill a reef, leading to the collapse of the ecosystem. Oceans are also becoming more acidic as they absorb the carbon dioxide emitted by humans from burning fossil fuels. That also stresses corals, making it difficult for them to build their skeletons. High ocean temperatures caused a  global coral bleaching event  in 2023-24, the second in the last 10 years. If the world passes 2 degrees Celsius of heating, an estimated  99% of the world's coral reefs could be lost . The damage is happening faster than scientists expected. Combined with the effects of pollution and human development, half of all reefs worldwide will be in unlivable conditions by 2035, according to a  recent study  from the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. \"The coming decades will bring, I think, unprecedented change for both these reef systems and humanity in general,\" says Erik Franklin, professor at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, who worked on the study. It's estimated that half a billion people around the world depend on coral reefs for food, income and livelihoods. Losing reefs would destabilize many countries, along with risking extinction for marine life that can only be found on coral reefs. \"There's entire societies and economies that are built around reef systems, especially in equatorial and tropical regions,\" Franklin says. \"So these societies will be in dire straits.\" Many scientists are searching for \"refuges\" — pockets of the ocean where conditions might remain livable for coral reefs. They're also selectively breeding corals, both in  Florida  and  Australia , boosting the corals' natural abilities to withstand heat. The hope is that it might help corals hold on,  surviving just long enough  until humans can get their heat-trapping emissions under control. Change No. 2: Ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica could collapse Ice sheets are the massive frozen expanses that cover Greenland and Antarctica and  contain about two-thirds  of the freshwater on Earth. Climate change is already causing them to melt and raising sea levels around the world. But if the Earth lingers at, or above, 2 degrees Celsius of warming, as it is on track to, that melting will steadily accelerate. Scientists warn that will cause parts of the ice sheets to collapse, sending massive amounts of water into the world's oceans. The million-dollar question is how quickly that collapse will occur. \"Collapse tends to be a bit of a loaded word. People think of it like a building collapse,\" says Ian Joughin, a glaciologist at the University of Washington who has spent decades studying how giant glaciers move and change. \"Maybe a better timescale for an ice sheet [collapsing] is the Roman Empire,\" Joughin explains. Like a dying empire, the ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica are huge. It will take decades or even centuries for them to disintegrate. This year marks the  29th year  in a row that Greenland has lost more ice than it gained. In 2021,  rainfall was recorded  at the ice sheet's highest point, rather than snow, a sign that warmer temperatures were triggering widespread melting. As temperatures continue to warm, scientists say the 2-mile-thick ice sheet in Greenland is getting out of balance. Snow and ice are melting faster than they're being replaced, and as the ice melt accelerates, the process is difficult to stop. Research suggests that the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet may already be underway. A massive glacier there, which covers an area about the size of the state of Washington, is melting quickly in response to climate change and could splinter into the ocean in the coming decades. If that glacier melts entirely, it will add so much water to the oceans that sea levels will rise about 2 feet. If the entire West Antarctic ice sheet melts, scientists estimate that sea levels will rise about 12 feet. Due to their enormous size, ice sheets have a huge amount of inertia. Once the melt process gets underway, it's difficult to stop. \"It takes a few hundred years to really get going,\" says Joughin. \"And it's kind of a snowball effect, where the faster it goes, the more it's going to go.\" But it will take a long time for people around the world to feel the most extreme effects of that melt. \"It could be anywhere from two or three hundred years to a thousand years,\" says Joughin. If humans slow down the pace of global warming, it will help slow down the pace of ice melting, giving the billions of people who live along coastlines more time to adapt. Change No. 3: Permanently frozen ground is thawing Climate change is causing permafrost — the permanently frozen ground in the Arctic — to thaw. And as the Earth approaches 2 degrees Celsius of warming, that thawing ground will cause both local and global problems. Let's start local. When permafrost thaws, the ice that's trapped in the ground turns into water and drains away. \"It can have really profound consequences,\" says Merritt Turetsky, a permafrost researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"We can see lakes draining overnight. We can see ecosystems becoming much drier in some areas, because the permafrost was actually holding the water up at the surface.\" That's because when the ground is frozen, it's impermeable to moisture, like the lining of a bathtub. \"When it thaws, we pull the drain out of the bathtub,\" Turetsky explains. Thawing permafrost has profound impacts for the millions of people who live in the Arctic. In many places, the land is sinking as it thaws, cracking the foundations of buildings, buckling roads and runways and kinking pipelines. That will accelerate as the Earth heats up more. Thawing permafrost also has global climate implications. Permanently frozen ground is like the world's freezer: millennia of dead plants and animals are locked up in permafrost. \"When permafrost thaws it's a little like losing power to your freezer. That food starts to rot,\" explains Ted Schuur, a permafrost expert at Northern Arizona University. Bacteria and fungi start to digest the carbon-rich soil, releasing planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Basically, it's an infinite loop of greenhouse gases: human emissions cause the planet to heat up. That heat thaws permafrost, which releases more emissions. In recent years, advances in Arctic data collection have allowed scientists to measure greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost more accurately, says Schuur. The upshot has been sobering. \"This new science is showing that this is happening right now,\" he explains. The so-called tipping point has  already begun . But how much extra carbon ultimately gets released by Arctic permafrost in the future is up to humans. \"The faster we can decarbonize society today, the more permafrost carbon we can keep in the Arctic ground where it belongs,\" says Turetsky. For example, by using renewable energy sources instead of burning fossil fuels. \"Every tenth of a degree matters. And every act we take matters,\" says Schuur.

season could be nasty this winter \n         By Rob Stein \n        \n           Wednesday, November 19, 2025 • 5:06 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The U.S. may be entering another rough winter for flu, according to early data. \"The signs are, it could be a big season,\" says  Richard Webby , who studies the flu at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. \"The flu season might have a little bit of a punch to it this year.\" The first clue to what may be in store is what influenza did during the Southern Hemisphere's winter. That often predicts what's coming for the Northern Hemisphere. \"They had some pretty decent flu activity in many parts of the Southern Hemisphere,\" Webby says. \"It actually lasted for a longer period of time — the tail of the season went on for longer than typical.\" And now, parts of the Northern Hemisphere, such as the United Kingdom, are being hit hard. That often foreshadows what's in store for the U.S. Another clue is the Northern Hemisphere's dominant flu strain so far. It's an H3N2 flu virus,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  flu tracker. And H3N2 viruses \"tend to be a little bit more problematic,\" Webby says. \"When we have an H3N2 season, we tend to have a little bit more activity, a little bit more disease at the severe end of the spectrum.\" The last major flu season dominated by H3N2 was 2016-2017. In addition, a new H3N2 variant recently evolved and has become the dominant strain in the U.S. \"There is basically a new variant of influenza circulating that has mutated a little bit,\" says  Caitlin Rivers , an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. \"And that means that it's just different enough from what your body or the vaccine may recognize that it can kind of get around those protections.\" And she says the flu shot this year \"may not be as good a match as if we hadn't seen this new variant.\" That said, data from the U.K. indicates the vaccines still make a difference, Rivers says. In the U.K., the vaccines appear to be about 70% to 75% protective against hospitalization in children and about 30% to 40% protective against hospitalization in adults. So Rivers and others are urging anyone who hasn't already gotten a flu shot to get one. \"Definitely get it as soon as possible. Because activity is low right now. But it is increasing. And it will continue to increase straight through until we hit peak, which is usually around the holiday season. There's no sense in waiting when we are barreling into flu season,\" Rivers says. It takes about two weeks for immunity to kick in. And people don't want to catch or spread the flu over Thanksgiving. The flu kills between roughly 12,000 and 52,000 people in the U.S. every winter. \"I do have concerns that uptake of both the influenza and the annual COVID vaccine won't be as high this year as it had been in previous years,\" Rivers said. She is concerned by rhetoric coming from federal health officials questioning \"whether vaccines are safe and effective.\" \"We know that they are,\" she says. \"And they are important for protecting against severe illness. So it's really important that people go out and get them this year.\" In a written statement to NPR, a Health and Human Services spokesperson said: \"It is too early to know what viruses will spread this season, in what proportion, and how well the vaccine will work in the United States.\" The statement added: \"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Individuals should speak to their healthcare provider on the risks and benefits of a vaccine.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   The U.S. may be facing a winter full of fevers, coughs, sore throats and chills. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein looks at the warning signs for flu season. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: The flu has come roaring back since the pandemic. This year's season is just getting going, but there are already clues it could be another nasty one. RICHARD WEBBY: Yeah. If you squint, you know, perhaps we're headed for a big flu season. STEIN: Richard Webby studies the flu at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. WEBBY: The flu season might have a little bit of a punch to it this year. STEIN: The first sign is what the flu did in the Southern Hemisphere's winter. That often predicts what's coming for the Northern Hemisphere. WEBBY: They had some pretty decent flu activity in many parts of the Southern Hemisphere. It actually lasted for a longer period of time. Sort of the tail of the season went on for longer than typical. STEIN: Making more people sick. And now parts of the Northern Hemisphere, like the U.K., are getting hit hard. That often foreshadows what's coming for the U.S. And there's another clue - the dominant flu variant so far. It's called H3N2, and H3N2 viruses are often more dangerous. WEBBY: H3 tends to be a little bit more problematic. So when we have an H3N2 season, we tend to have a little bit more activity, a little bit more disease at the severe end of the spectrum. STEIN: Especially among older people. And Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, says a tricky new H3N2 strain recently evolved. CAITLIN RIVERS: There is basically a new variant of influenza circulating that has mutated a little bit. And that means that it's just different enough from what your body or the vaccine may recognize that it can kind of get around those protections. I do not expect that the vaccine will be a total miss, but it may not be as good of a match as if we hadn't seen this new variant. STEIN: That said, early data from the U.K. indicate the vaccines are working well enough. So Rivers and others are urging anyone who hasn't already gotten a flu shot to get one, pronto. RIVERS: Definitely get it as soon as possible. If you haven't already, now is the time because activity is low right now, but it is increasing. And it will continue to increase straight through until we hit peak, which is usually around the holiday season. There's no sense in waiting when we are barreling into flu season. STEIN: It takes about two weeks for immunity to kick in. And don't forget - the flu often kills tens of thousands of Americans every winter.

According to company spokesperson Robert Gibbs, they expect to have a decision about the sale by Christmas. It's become something of a Hollywood parlor game to guess who will ultimately take over   the business, which was  founded in 1923 by four brothers : Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner. They owned a movie theater in Pennsylvania before coming to Hollywood to make movies. Warner Brothers Pictures found one of its first silent picture stars in a German shepherd named Rin Tin Tin. By 1927, the studio made history with its feature-length \"talkie\" picture:  The Jazz Singer,  starring Al Jolson. Over the years, Warner Brothers has made or distributed countless iconic films including:  Casablanca, The Big Sleep  and  The Maltese Falcon  in the 1940's .  The list goes on, with titles like  A Clockwork Orange ,  Goodfellas, Barbie,  as well as Bugs Bunny and all the Looney Tunes cartoons. Warners Brothers has had multiple owners over the decades. Three years ago, Warner Media, as it was called, merged with Discovery. And in June, the company announced it would split in two, with film, TV and streaming studios in one camp, and in the other, mostly legacy cable channels, including CNN. The planned split has not yet happened, and a new buyer might get the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery and its film and TV libraries.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       As the film industry continues to consolidate, there's speculation that Warner Brothers' old rival Paramount could take over. Having just merged as Paramount Skydance, CEO David Ellison has already made several overtures. The idea of streaming giant Netflix buying the company has raised  antitrust concerns on Capitol Hill . In an earnings call last month, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors, \"We've been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks. There is no change there.\" Industry watchers suggest other suitors could be Comcast, Amazon, or an investor who's not already in the entertainment business. Regardless of whoever does end up buying the company, theater owners say they hope making movies for cinemas will be a priority. \"As long as we have more movies,\" says Daniel Loria, senior vice president at  The Boxoffice Company , which analyzes data from studios and theaters. \"That doesn't mean the same amount, doesn't mean less, but more movies. I think you're going to find folks in the movie theater industry support any business decision that gets us there.\" Loria recalls that after Disney purchased Fox and Fox Searchlight, their combined studios significantly reduced the number of films they released in the theaters. Crunching the numbers, Loria says in 2016, a year before the merger announcement, Disney and Fox released a total of 38 theatrical films. This year, the consolidated studios released 18. That's a problem for theater owners who've been struggling to bring audiences back to cinemas after the COVID-19 pandemic shut them down; they're competing with movie-watching on TVs, computers and phones. Some theater owners and cinephiles also fear studio conglomerates will only greenlight a few big-budget blockbusters, leaving the lower budget indies behind. \"The concern is you're going to see less of that risk taking, less of that experimentation and less of that embracing new directors, new filmmakers in the future,\" says Max Friend, the CEO of  Filmbot , the ticketing platform for independent cinemas in the U.S. \"It's really important that there are studios that are funding and supporting, cultivating that kind of work.\" He points out that this year, Warner Brothers made a string of critical hits, including Ryan Coogler's  Sinners , the horror film  Weapons  and Paul Thomas Anderson's  One Battle After Another .

(SOUNDBITE OF CARY GRANT'S \"OPENING/END TITLE FROM 'ARSENIC AND OLD LACE'\") MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Warner Brothers has been in business since 1923, founded by four brothers, Harry, Albert Sam, and Jack Warner.

DEL BARCO: That's Daniel Loria, senior vice president at the Boxoffice Company, which analyzes data from studios and theaters. He says when Disney purchased Fox and Fox Searchlight, their combined studios significantly reduced the number of films they released in the theaters. That's a problem for theater owners who have been struggling to bring audiences back to cinemas after the COVID-19 pandemic shut them down.

Trump could have chosen to release many of the files on his own months ago. “Democrats have used the ‘Epstein’ issue, which affects them far more than the Republican Party, in order to try and distract from our AMAZING Victories,” Trump said in a social media post as he announced he had signed the bill. Now, the bill requires the Justice Department to release all files and communications related to Epstein, as well as any information about the investigation into his death in a federal prison in 2019, within 30 days. It allows for redactions about Epstein’s victims for ongoing federal investigations, but DOJ cannot withhold information due to “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.” It was a remarkable turn of events for what was once a farfetched effort to force the disclosure of case files from an odd congressional coalition of Democrats, one GOP antagonist of the president, and a handful of erstwhile Trump loyalists. As recently as last week, the Trump administration even summoned one Republican proponent of releasing the files, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, to the Situation Room to discuss the matter, although she did not change her mind. Related Stories What to know about Larry Summers, who has taken leave from Harvard due to Epstein emails 4 MIN READ House gets back to work and quickly falls into a cycle of punishing its own 5 MIN READ What’s next now that Trump has signed bill releasing the Epstein files 5 MIN READ But over the weekend, Trump did a sharp U-turn on the files once it became clear that congressional action was inevitable. He insisted the Epstein matter had become a distraction to the GOP agenda and indicated he wanted to move on. “I just don’t want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we’ve had,” Trump said in a social media post Tuesday afternoon, explaining the rationale for his abrupt about-face. The House passed the legislation on a 427-1 vote, with Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., being the sole dissenter . He argued that the bill’s language could lead to the release of information on innocent people mentioned in the federal investigation. The Senate later approved it unanimously, skipping a formal vote. It’s long been established that Trump had been friends with Epstein, the disgraced financier who was close to the world’s elite. But the president has consistently said he did not know of Epstein’s crimes and had cut ties with him long ago. Before Trump returned to the White House for a second term, some of his closest political allies helped fuel conspiracy theories about the government’s handling of the Epstein case, asserting a cover-up of potentially incriminating information in those files."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5585079","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:42:00-04:00","title":"Lewis Capaldi on healing, humor and his new EP","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lewis Capaldi, the Scottish singer-songwriter known for his emotional ballads, experienced a public meltdown at Glastonbury Festival in 2023 due to performance pressure and Tourette syndrome, which led to a two-year mental health break.

Standing before a massive crowd and singing the song that made him a global star, \"Someone You Loved,\" the Scottish singer-songwriter's  voice cracked . His shoulder twitched — a symptom of his Tourette syndrome — and he couldn't finish the chorus. The crowd took over, singing the hit back to him as he stepped away from the mic. Capaldi calls it a \"meltdown.\" But now, he says, it became the moment that ultimately saved him. \"I look at it now and I'm, like, that needed to happen,\" Capaldi told NPR's  Morning Edition . \"I'd really sort of worked myself into the ground making a second album. The success of the first album had really put the fear of God into me.\" The pressure from fear of being a one-hit wonder to a grueling work schedule to his Tourette diagnosis pushed him into a spiral he didn't fully recognize until that moment. Without that Glastonbury incident, he says, he might have kept going \"until the wheels came off.\" Capaldi disappeared from the spotlight for nearly two years. Now he's back, cautiously — and with new music. His new EP,  Survive , is just four tracks long, a deliberate choice to avoid the perfectionism and pressure of his second album. One track, \"The Day That I Die,\" is his favorite, and also the hardest to talk about. Capaldi says he wrote it after struggling to taper off a high dose of sertraline (the generic version of Zoloft), prescribed for anxiety and depression. \"I never really had end-of-life thoughts before,\" he said. \"But coming off sertraline, I found I was having really, really dark days. And much later, thinking about that time when I was writing, I just thought 'what would you say to someone' — I guess, a suicide note — what would I say to people if heaven forbid I succumbed to all dark moments that I was having?\" Capaldi said he still finds that song difficult to discuss, noting that \"everything's good now.\" But he pointed to the title track, \"Survive,\" as a better reflection of how he feels today, with lyrics like \"I swear to God I'll survive\" and \"I'm gonna get up and try if it's the last thing I do.\" \"I didn't want to come back and be like, 'Here's a song called The Day That I Die,'\" he said. \"So I wanted to, like, really have a positive flag in the sand, sort of like, we're back, and this is how I'm feeling, and this is how everything is.\" Now, Capaldi is looking forward to whatever comes next. He hopes he'll be able to show more of his funny side that was  clearly evident between tracks  during his Tiny Desk performance. \"I would like to sort of incorporate that a little bit more and be a bit more adventurous when it comes to songwriting,\" he said. As he prepares for a U.S. tour in 2026, Capaldi is thinking about how he can finally move beyond being known as \"the ballad guy.\" If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, call or text  988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline .

Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi was on stage performing his massive hit \"Someone You Loved,\" and he struggled. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LEWIS CAPALDI: (Singing) I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Woo. CAPALDI: (Singing) This... FADEL: His voice cracked. One shoulder twitched uncontrollably - symptoms of his Tourette syndrome. He stopped singing. The crowd sang the track for him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) Now the day bleeds into nightfall, and you're not here to get me through it all. FADEL: After that performance, Capaldi took a mental health break for nearly two years. Fast forward to this summer's Glastonbury, and Capaldi made an emotional return to finish that song. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CAPALDI: (Singing) I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug. I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved. (CHEERING) FADEL: Now, Lewis Capaldi's released a new EP called \"Survive.\" When we talked, I asked him about his journey back to the stage. And I should let you know that part of our discussion includes mentions of suicide. CAPALDI: That moment at Glastonbury, where I had a bit of a meltdown, at the time, felt like a really horrible thing and probably the worst thing that's ever happened to me in my life. But on reflection now and obviously having been away and sort of worked on myself and got myself to a point of being able to come back and come at it from a much healthier standpoint, I kind of look at it now and I'm, like, that needed to happen. FADEL: Yeah. CAPALDI: Otherwise, I would've stopped until the wheels sort of came off. FADEL: What was happening then that you were dealing with? CAPALDI: I'd really sort of worked myself into the ground making a second album. The success of the first album had really put, like, the fear of God into me, really, to be honest of like... FADEL: Like, I have to match it. I have to do it again. CAPALDI: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. That sort of fear of, like, oh, no. And if I don't do it again, you worry, oh, people will be like, one-hit wonder sort of thing. And I just really, like, let that get to me. And that was kind of propelling everything I was doing. I was, like, writing songs from a place of, oh, I need to have another hit rather than, oh, what feels right to write a song about. FADEL: Yeah. And now you have this new EP out, and it's called \"Survive.\" CAPALDI: Yes. FADEL: There's one track. It's called \"The Day That I Die.\" CAPALDI: Yes. FADEL: And it starts, on the day that I die, tell my mother I was smiling. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE DAY THAT I DIE\") CAPALDI: (Singing) On the day that I die, tell my mother I was smiling 'cause I know that she'll be crying rivers wide. FADEL: It sounds like a message to those you love after you're gone. CAPALDI: Yeah. FADEL: What was happening when you wrote these words? CAPALDI: During that period of time when I was going through, like, sort of all just periods of making the second album and then having my Tourette's stuff and the anxiety, I was going to a doctor. And I was prescribed sertraline, which I think it might be Zoloft in America. And I was on quite a high dosage of it, and I was like, do you know, I need to get off this. And I never really had sort of end-of-life thoughts... FADEL: Yeah. CAPALDI: ...I guess, before. But coming off sertraline, I really found I was having, like, really, really dark days. And it was actually much later, thinking about that time when I was writing, I just thought, you know, what would you say to someone - I guess, a suicide note. What would I say to people if heaven forbid, like, I succumb to all those, you know, dark moments that I was having? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE DAY THAT I DIE\") CAPALDI: (Singing) Don't cry. Don't cry on the day that I die. It's still a weird one for me to talk about that song 'cause it's like I have to, like, preface it with, like, by the way, I'm fine. Do you know what I mean? FADEL: Don't worry. CAPALDI: I'm, like, everything's good now. FADEL: But you have another song on the album that kind of does that, right? You have the title track, \"Survive.\" CAPALDI: Yeah, exactly. FADEL: And it sounds to me like coming out the other side, the opposite message. I'm going to get up and try. CAPALDI: Yeah, yeah. A hundred percent. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SURVIVE\") CAPALDI: (Singing) But when hope is lost, and I come undone, I swear to God, I'll survive if it kills me to. I'm gonna get up and try if it's the last thing I do. \"Survive\" isn't my favorite song on the EP. I love it, but it was one of those things where I thought it was important that that was the first thing people heard. I don't want to come back and be like, I've had, like, a really dark two years, and I've been away. And the last time you saw me, I was really struggling. And here's a song called \"The Day That I Die.\" So I wanted to, like, really have, like, a positive flag in the sand, sort of like we're back, and this is how I'm feeling, and this is how everything is. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SURVIVE\") CAPALDI: (Singing) I'm gonna get up and live until the day that I die. I swear to God I'll survive. I just wanted people to hear that from me, this message of, like, resilience. FADEL: What's your favorite song on the album? CAPALDI: Probably \"The Day That I Die\" - I just think in terms of lyrics, it's really where I want to be headed - not beheaded but be headed. (LAUGHTER) CAPALDI: It's really where I want to, like, head towards, in terms of, like, just really being as honest as possible, even if it's maybe, like, a bit uncomfortable. FADEL: Your music is so emotional. It gets right at the heart of love and loss and grief and struggle, but you're also so funny. CAPALDI: Thanks. Yes. FADEL: I remember your Tiny Desk for us, where, you know, it's marked by like, oh, glad I didn't F that one up. CAPALDI: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah, yeah. FADEL: Do you think about incorporating that natural comedy into your music? CAPALDI: Yeah, sometimes. I always look at, like, Sabrina Carpenter as an example. I think she's amazing at weaving in her, like, humor into those songs and stuff. And I'd love to be able to do that. But it's just, I got into a point of I'm the ballad guy. I'm just going to write ballads. For me, it became quite tedious. Like, I went into a room with some people, and I was trying to say to them about how I wanted to write something else other than a ballad. And I remember, like, this room of people who I love - they're all great people, but they were trying to convince me why I should be writing ballads. And I just felt this really disheartening thing of, like, I really want to branch out a little bit and push things. And to your point, I would like to sort of incorporate that a little bit more and be a bit more adventurous when it comes to songwriting. I'm really excited about the next thing, whatever that is 'cause I just feel like... FADEL: Yeah. CAPALDI: ...It's going to be coming from a completely different place. Do you know what I mean? FADEL: Yeah. Lewis Capaldi's new EP, \"Survive,\" is out now. Lewis, thank you so much and congratulations. CAPALDI: Thank you so much. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ALMOST\") CAPALDI: (Singing) I swear to God I'm almost all right. I only think about you all the time. FADEL: If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, you can call or text three numbers - 988 - to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ALMOST\") CAPALDI: (Singing) ...Completely let you go almost. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611445","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"11:04:00-05:00","title":"As a labor force, artists are 'invisible.'

Researchers surveyed more than 2,600 artists nationwide from across disciplines and working arrangements. They were asked a range of questions on everything from housing, the hours they work and health benefits to how they make money. The study was funded by the Mellon Foundation. Among the key findings: 57% of artists reported being \"somewhat or very worried\" about being able to afford \"food, housing, medical care, or utilities\"; 37% received income from public assistance sources, including Social Security and state or local welfare; 34% of artists are self-employed, 11% \"juggled three or more jobs\"; 28% \"provide unpaid assistance to a family member or friend due to a health condition or disability.\" The NORC study released Wednesday isn't the first to confirm that most artists aren't in it for the money and that the systems that support them in the United States are fragile.  Museums  are struggling this year. Government and  foundation  grants can be  precarious . During the pandemic, concert venues and theaters were  among  the first to close and the last to reopen. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Rugg said this is the first study to \"paint a more comprehensive and nuanced portrait of working artists today.\" \"And not having that data,\" said Gonzalo Casals, \"you're invisible.\" Casals commissioned the survey when he was a senior policy fellow for arts and culture at the Mellon Foundation. Today, he is co-director of the Culture and Arts Policy Institute, which provides policy guidance for those in New York's arts sector.

Humphrey said there are plenty of people who love attending dance performances but \"don't understand the process. They just see the outcome.\" \"Most dancers who work in a company don't have health insurance benefits. And when you work in a career that is athletic, you would think having the ability to go to a doctor for regular care would be something that would be a part of your full time job. And it is not necessarily that way,\" said Humphrey, \"So the data helps us quantify those stories that we see every day.\" Rugg believes \"the best programs and policies are always rooted in data\" but that many arts organizations have had a \"data allergy stemming from some combination of a lack of desire or a lack of resources. \" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Anyone can access the results of the study  here .

Hearings repeatedly ended with cases dismissed by the government, allowing agents to arrest immigrants in courthouse hallways. AP reporters also reviewed internal records and spoke to judges, clerks and lawyers for the departments of Justice and Homeland Security to gain insight about the scope of the administration’s effort. The government lawyer knew what was coming as she stood inside a courtroom and texted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent waiting in a corridor a few feet away. “I can’t do this,” the lawyer said in a text message as she looked at her docket of cases. “This is a new emotional load.” “I understand,” the agent responded. “Hopefully we meet again in a better situation.” Nearby, a Cuban man who had lived in the United States for years stepped from an elevator and into the courtroom where the government lawyer was waiting for what the man thought was a routine hearing. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on The man was doing what the law required, and brought along his wife, a legal resident, and their 7-month-old infant. Then the lawyer quickly moved to have the man’s asylum claim dismissed and a judge agreed, making the man eligible for “expedited removal.” As he left the courtroom, the man was swarmed by plainclothes immigration agents who had been surveilling him. A struggle ensued and the wife’s shouts could be heard from the hallway as the lawyer moved on to the next case. The agent replied four minutes later: “Got him.” Similar scenes of courthouse arrests , part of a makeover of the immigration courts under President Donald Trump, are playing out across the United States as his call for mass deportations of migrants is executed with unusually aggressive tactics.

Now that Americans have seen how the plan is being implemented, there are signs that many think he has gone too far. About 57% of adults disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, according to a survey this month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research . Over several months, reporters for The Associated Press observed immigration court proceedings in 21 cities. Hearings repeatedly ended with cases dismissed by the government, allowing plainclothes federal agents to carry out arrests in courthouse hallways in close coordination with attorneys from the Department of Homeland Security. Screenshots of the text messages were obtained by The Associated Press from a government official who feared reprisal and provided them on condition of anonymity. The messages offer a rare look at how the nation’s 75 immigration courts are churning out rulings in an assembly-line like fashion and how, for many people, the courtrooms have become deportation traps.

Due process seemingly is an afterthought. “When Americans picture a courtroom, there are a few core expectations” of fairness, dignity and impartiality, said Ashley Tabaddor, a former immigration judge in Los Angeles and past president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. “That’s what makes a court — not a room with a bench or person with a robe,” she said. “But what we have here is a vision completely turned on its head.” Over the past nine months, the Trump administration has fired almost 90 immigration judges seen by Trump’s allies as too lenient, directed masked officers to handcuff migrants at closed asylum hearings and sent memos instructing judges to fall into line. Unlike federal courts, where there are strict rules of procedure and judges have lifetime tenure, the Justice Department runs immigration courts and the attorney general can fire the judges with fewer restraints. Nine current officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Most expressed deep misgivings about punishing people who had followed the rules and showed up for court hearings. “As a government attorney, my duty is to uphold the law and protect the public interest — not to secure removal or detention outcomes by default,” a government lawyer wrote to the American Bar Association seeking professional guidance. But that is not how cases are often unfolding. Courthouse arrests are coordinated days in advance to meet quotas with little regard for the particulars of a case, according to several of the U.S. officials. According to one official, Homeland Security lawyers note on a spreadsheet which cases are “amenable” to dismissal, allowing an asylum-seeker to be immediately rearrested and placed in expedited removal proceedings. Most of those detained are men without lawyers who entered the U.S. alone and are expected to appear in court in person. Contrary to Trump’s claims that he is targeting the ‘worst of the worst,’ most don’t have a criminal conviction, according to a Cato Institute analysis of ICE data . ICE reviews the spreadsheet and selects which people it wants to pursue if cases are dismissed. On the hearing date, federal agents communicate directly with DHS lawyers, who act as prosecutors in immigration courts. The lawyer often provides near verbatim updates of the proceedings over text message to agents waiting outside the courtroom. “Black shirt? Let me know if the judge dismissed,” an ICE agent texted during one hearing.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Lack of independence limits immigration court’s authority Almost from the outset, immigration courts were plagued by a lack of resources, authority and judicial independence. The courts were established in 1952, but it was not until 1973 that “special inquiry officers” were given the “judge” title and allowed to wear judicial robes. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, was created in 1983. But that agency remained a part of the Justice Department, giving the attorney general authority to override decisions. “We were a legal Cinderella,” said Dana Leigh Marks, who retired as an immigration judge in 2021 after a 34-year career. “No other court in the nation functions like this.” The first Trump administration undertook a series of changes to reduce the case backlog, including instructing judges to deny entire categories of asylum claims such as for victims of gang or domestic violence. It also set up a dashboard that would become the bane of many judges: Red, yellow and green gauges measure each judge’s performance on goals ranging from completed cases — a minimum of 700 annually, regardless of complexity — to how many custody cases were decided on their first hearings. To meet the metrics, judges must race through dockets, sometimes devoting mere minutes to evaluate asylum-seekers’ claims. “It’s like deciding death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” Marks said.

Since then, the Justice Department has issued 52 policy memos — more than the previous six years combined — making it easier to hire and fire judges and warning against pro-migrant bias. The memos highlight the courts’ weakened status by referring to judges as “inferior officers” — a rarely used term taken from the Constitution. In early September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would lend 600 military lawyers to the immigration courts , about equal to the current number of judges. The goal, according to the administration, is to more effectively reduce caseloads by widening the pool of potential judges to include people already steeped in administrative law. But many migrant advocates are concerned the incoming judges lack the necessary experience to decide asylum cases. “It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement,” said Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The administration has pushed back against criticism it is co-opting the courts to accelerate its deportation goals. In a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said DHS decides whether to arrest migrants and that most judges consider it an “honor rather than an insult” to be called an inferior officer empowered by the Constitution and serving at the will of the attorney general. Baldassarre likened a record surge of asylum seekers during the Biden administration to an “improper conspiracy between DHS and the Immigration Courts to effectuate an unlawful amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.” The Justice Department, she said, had “restored the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the Courts.” DHS did not respond to repeated email and phone requests for comment.

Fear prevails. Resumes are being updated. One DHS lawyer described being haunted at night by the sound of jangling shackles of migrants the lawyer helped arrest. The lawyer joined the government after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, believing that protecting America’s borders was a patriotic duty. The lawyer still cherishes a signed copy of Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel’s memoir “Night,” which was handed out at a work seminar. “Think higher, feel deeper,” reads the author’s inscription of the book, which is marked DHS “Training Material.” Today, its message torments. “This isn’t what any of us signed up for,” the lawyer said. After a turbulent summer, the courthouses are starting to look lonely, too. With word spreading that a trap had been laid, many migrants, fearing arrest, are asking to appear online or are skipping hearings altogether. Meanwhile, ambitious managers are publicly upbraiding those who raise doubts about the legality of locking up migrants with no criminal record in packed facilities. In a recent town hall with DHS principal legal adviser Charles Wall, several lawyers complained about the pressure, confusing orders and lack of resources, according to notes from the meeting shared with AP. Wall said the pace is likely to continue for years, the notes say. When one federal employee asked about bringing firearms to work for fear of harassment by activists inside courthouses, Wall said that judges should not hesitate to kick out the public. Wall could not be reached for comment.

That is more than the previous five years combined. The number is almost certainly an undercount because most migrants do not withdraw their asylum claim before self-deporting. At immigration court in Tacoma, Washington, the detainees came up one after the other with the same plea. “I want to go back to my country,” a Venezuelan man told Judge Theresa Scala. “I want to leave the country,” said a man from Mexico. Immigrants know what they face: detention centers with ominous names — “Alligator Alcatraz,” “Louisiana Lockup” and “Speedway Slammer” — as well as workplace raids and neighborhood dragnets.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Fired judges targeted as too liberal Tania Nemer believes she was cut out to be a judge. From the bench at immigration court in Cleveland, she prided herself on listening carefully to each person’s asylum claim. “There’s a simplicity about it that I just loved,” she told the AP. “If you can provide justice in an efficient manner, you can really help a lot of people.” The decision to apply to become an immigration judge in 2023 was deeply personal. Her father fled turmoil in Lebanon and arrived in Ohio at 16 with $6 in his pocket. He washed cars, learned English and eventually opened a namesake bar — Manny’s Pub — that allowed him to provide for his family. When Nemer married, her wedding gift was the unspent dollar bills, so she would never forget her roots. But Nemer’s fondness for the law came crashing down Feb. 5. In the middle of a hearing, her supervisor opened the door of her packed courtroom and told her she needed to come with him. “As soon as he said ‘Grab your ID,’ I knew I was being terminated,” she said. Still in shock, she was handed a two-paragraph letter, digitally signed by Sirce Owen, the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It said she was being removed because the agency “has determined that retaining you is not appropriate, and we thank you for your service.” No justification was given. But she thinks she knows some of the reasons: her Arab-sounding name, a history of previously representing migrants and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, course work from Cornell University. She filed a discrimination claim with the Justice Department to find out why she was fired; the complaint was dismissed. Nemer was the first judge fired after Trump returned to the White House. But 86 have been sacked since. Dozens more took the Department of Government Efficiency’s “Fork in the Road” resignation offer. The majority were hired under Democratic President Joe Biden and are still serving two-year probationary periods, according to a list of the fired judges obtained by the AP. It is unclear who ordered the firings or how they were selected. But those removed granted asylum at markedly higher rates than their peers — in about half of all cases since August 2023 compared with 34% nationwide, according to Mobile Pathways. Among those purged were all 10 that appeared on the DHS Bureaucrat Watch List , a website created last year with funding from The Heritage Foundation, whose Project 2025 was a blueprint for the Trump administration’s policies and personnel decisions. The list includes names, Facebook photos, salaries and campaign donations for what it calls “America’s most subversive immigration bureaucrats.” One target was Emmett Soper, a judge in northern Virginia who worked at EOIR headquarters during the Biden administration. “As soon as I saw that, I knew the rules were changing, that I was under some kind of microscope that didn’t exist before,” he said. Tom Jones, the conservative creator of the website, declined to be interviewed. Baldassarre, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said the department is not targeting specific individuals for firing but does continually evaluate all judges. “All judges have a legal, ethical, and professional obligation to be impartial and neutral in adjudicating cases,” Baldassarre said. “If a judge violates that obligation by demonstrating a systematic bias in favor of or against either party, EOIR is obligated to take action to preserve the integrity of its system.” The wave of firings and new directives from the Justice Department has had a chilling effect. Denial of motions to appear for hearings online tripled after a March memo repealing Biden-era guidelines instructing judges to generally grant such requests, according to Mobile Pathways data. Denial of continuances, which allow migrants extra time to seek legal counsel, have also spiked as have the number of cases classified as abandoned. Nemer returned to immigration court in October for the first time since being fired to represent a Mexican client she has known for 20 years and who was picked up by unidentified agents. While the man was jailed, his girlfriend, who was five months pregnant, miscarried. Word of the former judge’s return quickly spread and a stream of former colleagues came to the courtroom to hug her and express their dismay over her firing. “By the third hug I couldn’t hold it in and just started crying,” she said.

This is the new office of American Gateways. In April, the administration eliminated programs worth $30 million to provide free legal assistance to migrants, the vast majority of whom represent themselves in court. But lawyers for American Gateways keep coming, four times a week, setting up in a parking lot. The conference room they once occupied inside the courthouse is now used as a break room for ICE agents. Assistance ranges from helping immigrants file motions to rehearsing what they will say to judges. When they can, they sign people up for virtual appearances to minimize the risk of arrest.

Since May 15, when courthouse sweeps began, migrants have filed more than 3,000 habeas corpus petitions — to determine if someone is lawfully held in custody — seeking release. The flood of claims threatens to clog the already crowded federal docket, which has little authority in immigration cases. “The administration is attempting to press the gas at such an unreasonable speed without considering due process,” said Annelise Araujo, a Boston-based immigration attorney. One petition, filed in Miami, was from a Cuban man detained the same day he and his American wife and 10-month-old daughter were moving into their first home. Several petitioners said they had survived torture at the hands of gangs in Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela. Another legal challenge was introduced by an HIV-positive man from Brazil taken into custody four days after his husband died of a heart attack. With the body of Frederico Abreu’s husband still at the funeral home, ICE officials knocked on his door stating they had documents belonging to the deceased man.

One was a man from Honduras who showed up at the northern Virginia immigration court with his wife and their infant baby. Another child, a son, unable to walk, pushed himself in a wheelchair studded with flashing, colorful lights. The family, fearful of further immigration problems, did not want to be identified. The judge denied a government request to deport the man. But seconds later, as the family stepped from the courtroom, they were stopped by four ICE agents. The wife sobbed, hanging on her husband’s arm as she pleaded: “Por favor, Por favor.” The husband clutched the sleeping infant’s carrier. Their son sat playing with a cell phone. “I need you to go ahead and say goodbye,” an agent told the man. Crying, the man knelt to hug his son, who clung to his father, yelling repeatedly: “Papa! Papa!” Finally, the father managed to pull himself away and started to leave with the ICE officers. The boy tried to chase them. But the ICE agent was holding the back of the wheelchair as the boy futilely pumped his arms. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed his July arrest. The family said he was later deported. Homeland Security said he voluntarily agreed to leave the country and returned to Honduras on Oct. 8 after three months in detention. __ Goodman reported from Cleveland and Sullivan from Minneapolis; AP reporters who contributed are: Cedar Attanasio in New York; Martha Bellisle in Seattle and Tacoma, Washington; Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix; Kate Brumback in Atlanta; Eric Gay in San Antonio, Texas; Valerie Gonzalez in Harlingen, Texas; Aaron Kessler in Washington; Gisela Salomon in Miami; Rebecca Santana in Annandale and Sterling, Virginia; Lea Skene in Baltimore; Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City; Colleen Slevin in Denver; Elliot Spagat in San Diego; Sophia Tareen in Chicago and Indianapolis; Amy Taxin in Santa Ana, California; Julie Watson in San Diego."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/fbi-progress-pride-flag-lawsuit-83c0d9750e9bf6a11a11b858420750a2","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:19:09+00:00","title":"FBI Agent Fired for Displaying LGBTQ+ Flag in Workplace","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Maltinsky, a 16-year veteran FBI intelligence specialist, was fired in 2025 during special agent training at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, for displaying a 'Progress Pride' flag at his workspace.

month for displaying at his workspace an LGBTQ+ flag, which had previously flown outside a field office, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court. David Maltinsky had worked at the FBI for 16 years and was nearly finished with special agent training in Quantico, Virginia, when he was called into a meeting last month with FBI officials, given a letter from Director Kash Patel and told he was being “summarily dismissed” over the inappropriate display of political signage, Maltinsky’s lawsuit said. The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, said Maltinsky had been a decorated intelligence specialist working in the Los Angeles field office and most recently was pursuing a longtime dream of becoming a special agent. In June 2021, the Los Angeles field office displayed a “Progress Pride” flag, which consists of a rainbow-colored horizontal stripes and a chevron with black, brown, pink, light blue, and white colors. It’s meant to represent people of color, as well as the LGBTQ+ community. Maltinsky was given that flag after it had come down and was then displayed at his Los Angeles field office workstation with the support and permission of his supervisors, according to the lawsuit. In April, he began training at the FBI Academy to become a special agent and had successfully completed 16 of the 19 weeks of training at the time of his firing, the lawsuit stated.

Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida has been indicted on charges accusing her of stealing $5 million in federal disaster funds and using some of the money to aid her 2021 campaign, the Justice Department said Wednesday. The Democrat is accused of stealing Federal Emergency Management Agency overpayments that her family health care company had received through a federally funded COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, federal prosecutors said. A portion of the money was then funneled to support her campaign through candidate contributions, prosecutors allege. “Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. “No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.” A phone message left at Cherfilus-McCormick’s Washington office was not immediately returned. Cherfilus-McCormick was first elected to Congress in 2022 in the 20th District, representing parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, in a special election after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021. In December 2024, a Florida state agency sued a company owned by Cherfilus-McCormick’s family, saying it overcharged the state by nearly $5.8 million for work done during the pandemic and wouldn’t give the money back. The Florida Division of Emergency Management said it made a series of overpayments to Trinity Healthcare Services after hiring it in 2021 to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations.

The Office of Congressional Ethics said in a January report that Cherfilus-McCormick’s income in 2021 was more than $6 million higher than in 2020, driven by nearly $5.75 million in consulting and profit-sharing fees received from Trinity Healthcare Services.

killing one person, injuring another and forcing more than 170 people to evacuate. A man in his 70s was unaccounted for and firefighters later found a body, possibly of the missing man, and a woman in her 50s suffered a minor injury, the Oita prefecture disaster response team said. Dozens of fire engines and more than 200 firefighters were mobilized to battle the fire, which was not still fully under control more than a day after it started. The Ground Self-Defense Force dispatched two UH-1 army helicopters to assist. It may take a few more days before the fire is completely extinguished, town mayor Shinya Adachi told reporters after he visited the devastated neighborhood Wednesday. At least 170 homes have been damaged or burned down, the disaster response team said. The residential section struck by the fire is close to the coastal area of Oita known for mackerel fishing but not near the prefecture’s popular hot spring resorts, called onsen, and historic, thatched-roof homes.

The blaze spread to a forest, affecting about 4.9 hectares (12 acres), the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said. There was an advisory for strong wind when the fire broke out. A firefighter told the Kyodo News Agency that fire fighting operation was hampered by narrow backstreets where fire engines could not enter. There were also abandoned homes in the rapidly aging and shrinking neighborhood, Kyodo said. The local network YTV noted that the narrow alleyways where the fire burned had old wooden houses. The fires spread quickly as a strong wind was “blowing in all directions,” a 59-year-old office worker told Kyodo as she recalled how the fire started Tuesday evening. Authorities are still investigating the fire’s cause and how it spread, the FDMA said. Japanese television footage showed smoke rising from swaths of land filled with destroyed and damaged houses, though orange flames were no longer visible by midday Wednesday. The Oita prefecture said about 260 homes remained without electricity Wednesday afternoon. A resident told Kyodo that she quickly fled without many of her belongings because the fire “spread in the blink of an eye.” Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi posted a statement on X offering sympathy for those affected by the fire and pledged to “provide maximum support.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/byheart-baby-formula-botulism-recall-98ad391ac5606c980a012d35f5f7637c","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:46:41Z","title":"ByHeart Infant Formula Linked to Growing Outbreak of Infant Botulism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing outbreak of infant botulism has been linked to ByHeart infant formula, with 31 confirmed or suspected cases reported since August 2025.

The company said on its website that tests by an independent food safety laboratory in Seattle found Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that produces toxins that can lead to potentially life threatening illness in babies younger than 1. ByHeart officials said they notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the findings, but did not specify how many samples were tested and how many were positive for the germ. “We are working to investigate the facts, conduct ongoing testing to identify the source, and ensure this does not happen to families again,” ByHeart wrote on its website. The FDA did not immediately respond to questions about the findings. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday reported 31 cases of confirmed or suspected illness in babies who consumed ByHeart formula since August. The most recent case was reported on Nov. 13. No deaths have been reported in the outbreak, which was announced Nov. 8.

ByHeart, a New York-based manufacturer of organic infant formula, recalled all its products sold in the U.S. on Nov. 11. The company, which accounts for about 1% of the U.S. infant formula market, had been selling about 200,000 cans of the product each month. It can take up to 30 days for symptoms of infantile botulism to develop, medical experts said. Here’s what to know about the outbreak and infant botulism. The outbreak begins The outbreak has sickened babies aged about 2 weeks to about 6 months, the FDA said. All the infants were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula. California officials earlier confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart baby formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that can lead to illness. FDA inspectors have been to the company’s infant formula production plants in Allerton, Iowa; and Portland, Oregon. The FDA is investigating a rise in cases of infant botulism reported since August. “ByHeart brand formula is disproportionately represented among sick infants in this outbreak,” the agency said. Illnesses began between Aug. 9 and Nov. 13, federal officials said. Cases have been reported in Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington. Families of babies treated for botulism after drinking ByHeart formula have sued the company. Lawsuits filed in federal courts allege that the formula they fed their children was defective and ByHeart was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm. Causes of infant botulism Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. As of Sept. 20, 133 cases had been reported in the U.S. according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention records. There were 145 cases reported all of last year. The infection is caused by a type of bacteria that produces a toxin in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis. Infants are particularly vulnerable to infection because their gut microbiomes are not developed enough to prevent the spores from germinating and producing the toxin. They can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey. Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel “floppy” and can have problems swallowing or breathing. Baby formula has previously been linked to sporadic cases of illness, but no known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, according to research studies. Infant botulism treatment The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California’s infant botulism program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide. BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators. All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said. The treatment costs about $69,300 per child, California officials said. Potential impact on U.S. formula supplies There is little danger of infant formula shortages because ByHeart represents a small share of the market. That’s far different from the crises in late 2021 and 2022, when four infants were sickened by a different germ after consuming formula made by Abbott Nutrition. Two of the babies died. No direct link was found between the Abbott products and the infections caused by a different germ, cronobacter sakazakii, but FDA officials closed the company’s Michigan plant after contamination and other problems were detected. Abbott recalled top brands of infant formula, triggering a nationwide shortage that lasted months. In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company’s packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing “areas that still require corrective actions.” A ByHeart plant in Reading, Pennsylvania, was shut down in 2023 just before FDA inspectors found problems with mold, water leaks and insects, inspection documents show. Reviewing infant formula ingredients Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul the U.S. food supply and are taking a new look at infant formula . Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the FDA to review the nutrients and other ingredients in infant formula, which fills the bottles of millions of American babies. The effort, dubbed “Operation Stork Speed,” is the first deep look at the ingredients since 1998. FDA officials are reviewing comments from industry, health experts and public to decide next steps. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

disruptive U.S. government shutdown, federal SNAP food assistance is again flowing to low-income households. But in the months ahead, many participants will have to abide by new work requirements. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides monthly benefits — averaging around $190 per person — to about 42 million people nationwide. During the first couple weeks of November, many of those recipients missed their regular allotments as President Donald Trump’s administration battled in court over whether to tap into reserves to fund the program while the government was shut down. Here’s what to know about SNAP: The benefits are available across the country after lapses For the first part of the month, the situation was chaotic after the federal government said SNAP would not be funded because of the government shutdown. Some states replenished the electronic benefit cards used in the program either fully or partially, using their own funds or federal dollars that were part of court orders. Others didn’t. Most states boosted food charities, but lines were long and some shelves were empty. As soon as the government reopened on Nov. 12, many states rushed to get out benefits. By Tuesday, all states either had loaded full November benefits onto people’s electronic spending cards or were working on it, according to an Associated Press review. Participants should receive December SNAP benefits according to their normal schedule. More SNAP recipients will face work requirements A massive tax and spending bill signed into law in July by Trump expanded requirements for many adult SNAP recipients to work, volunteer or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don’t are limited to three months of benefits in a three-year period. The work requirements previously applied to adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don’t have dependents. The new law also applies those requirements to those ages 55 through 64 and to parents without children younger than 14. It repeals work exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans and young adults aging out of foster care. And it limits the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas lacking jobs. The Trump administration waived the work requirements in November, but the three-month clock on work-free SNAP benefits will be in full force in December. The new requirements are expected to reduce the average monthly number of SNAP recipients by about 2.4 million people over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Agriculture secretary casts doubt about SNAP In the aftermath of the shutdown, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, whose department administers SNAP, has cast doubt on the program. Rollins has said it is rife with fraud, including deceased people receiving benefits and some people receiving multiple benefits. Rollins suggested that everyone who receives SNAP be required to reapply. But it’s not clear whether Rollins was suggesting an additional requirement or referring to the current one that mandates people to periodically recertify their income and other information. An Agriculture Department spokesperson didn’t clarify but instead said in a statement that the standard recertification processes for households is part of a plan to eliminate fraud, abuse and waste. Under federal law, most households must report their income and basic information every four to six months and be fully recertified for SNAP at least every 12 months. Full recertification can occur every 24 months for households where all adults are age 60 and above or have disabilities. But states can require more frequent eligibility verifications. Last year, 27 states required at least some households to be fully recertified every four to six months, depending on their household circumstances, according to a USDA report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israeli-airstrike-palestinian-refugee-camp-3150371f4076d26ea211c460b6ae2b68","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:24:52Z","title":"Israeli Airstrike in Lebanon Kills 13, Hamas Denies Training Site Use","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Israeli airstrike on a car in the parking lot of a mosque in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp near Sidon, Lebanon, killed 13 people and wounded several others, marking the deadliest strike on Lebanon since a ceasefire in late 2024.

Lebanon (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon on Tuesday killed 13 people and wounded several others, state media and government officials said. It was the deadliest strike on Lebanon since a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war a year ago. The drone strike hit a car in the parking lot of a mosque in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirts of the coastal city of Sidon, the state-run National News Agency said. The Lebanese Health Ministry said 13 people were killed and several others wounded in the airstrike, without giving further details. Hamas fighters in the area prevented journalists from reaching the scene, as ambulances rushed to evacuate the wounded and the dead. The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas training compound that was being used to prepare an attack against Israel and its army. It added that the Israeli army would continue to act against Hamas wherever the group operates. Hamas condemned the attack in a statement saying the strike hit a sports playground and denying that it was a training compound. Over the past two years, Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed scores of officials from the militant Hezbollah group as well as Palestinian factions such as Hamas.

Several other Hamas officials have been killed in strikes since then. Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. That sparked Israel’s offensive on the Gaza Strip that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. A day after the Israel-Hamas war started, Hezbollah began firing rockets toward Israeli posts along the border. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes in Lebanon, and the two sides became locked in an escalating conflict that became a full-blown war in late September 2024. That war, the most recent of several conflicts involving Hezbollah over the past four decades, killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $11 billion worth of destruction, according to the World Bank. In Israel, 127 people died, including 80 soldiers. The war ended in late November 2024 with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. Since then, Israel has carried out scores of airstrikes in Lebanon, saying that Hezbollah is trying to rebuild its capabilities. Lebanon’s Health Ministry has reported more than 270 people killed and around 850 wounded by Israeli military actions since the ceasefire."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-redistricting-gerrymandering-congress-texas-california-2c5587f38df6428953c15ed43d631e53","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:11:39+00:00","title":"Trump’s Mid-Decade Redistricting Push Faces Legal and Political Backlash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump attempted to push Republican lawmakers in red states like Texas and Missouri to redraw congressional maps mid-decade to secure more conservative-leaning House seats and prevent a loss of control in the 2026 midterms, breaking with over a century of political tradition.

Republicans, the president said, were “entitled” to five more conservative-leaning U.S. House seats in Texas and additional ones in other red states. The president broke with more than a century of political tradition in directing the GOP to redraw those maps in the middle of the decade to avoid losing control of Congress in next year’s midterms. Four months later, Trump’s audacious ask looks anything but simple. After a federal court panel struck down Republicans’ new map in Texas on Tuesday, the entire exercise holds the potential to net Democrats more winnable seats in the House instead. “Trump may have let the genie out of the bottle,” said UCLA law professor Rick Hasen, “but he may not get the wish he’d hoped for.” Trump’s plan is to bolster his party’s narrow House margin to protect Republicans from losing control of the chamber in next year’s elections. Normally, the president’s party loses seats in the midterms. But his involvement in redistricting is instead becoming an illustration of the limits of presidential power. Gov.

Redrawing maps is a decentralized effort that involves navigating a tangle of legal rules. It also involves a tricky political calculus because the legislators who hold the power to draw maps often want to protect themselves, business interests or local communities more than ruthlessly help their party. And when one party moves aggressively to draw lines to help itself win elections — also known as gerrymandering — it runs the risk of pushing its rival party to do the same. That’s what Trump ended up doing, spurring California voters to replace their map drawn by a nonpartisan commission with one drawn by Democrats to gain five seats. If successful, the move would cancel out the action taken by Texas Republicans. California voters approved that map earlier this month, and if a Republican lawsuit fails to block it, that map giving Democrats more winnable seats will remain in effect even if Texas’ remains stalled. “Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned -- and democracy won,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, posted on X after the Texas ruling, mentioning his Republican counterpart in Texas along with the president. Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Republican whose northern California district would be redrawn under the state’s new map, agreed. “It could very well come out as a net loss for Republicans, honestly when you look at the map, or at the very least, it could end up being a wash,” Kiley said. “But it’s something that never should have happened. It was ill-conceived from the start.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during a rally with Harris County Democrats at the IBEW local 716 union hall in Houston, on Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More For Trump, a mix of wins and losses There’s no guarantee that Tuesday’s ruling on the Texas map will stand. Many lower courts have blocked Trump’s initiatives, only for the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court to put those rulings on hold . Texas Republicans immediately appealed Tuesday’s decision to the high court, too. Republicans hope the nation’s highest court also weakens or eliminates the last major component of the Voting Rights Act next year, which could open the door to further redraws in their favor. Even before Tuesday, Trump’s push for mid-decade redistricting was not playing out as neatly as he had hoped, though he had scored some apparent wins. North Carolina Republicans potentially created another conservative-leaning seat in that battleground state, while Missouri Republicans redrew their congressional map at Trump’s urging to eliminate one Democratic seat. The Missouri plan faces lawsuits and a possible referendum that would force a statewide vote on the matter. Trump’s push has faltered elsewhere. Republicans in Kansas balked at trying to eliminate the state’s lone swing seat, held by a Democratic congresswoman. Indiana Republicans also refused to redraw their map to eliminate their two Democratic-leaning congressional seats. After Trump attacked the main Indiana holdout, state Sen. Greg Goode, on social media, he was the victim of a swatting call over the weekend that led to sheriff’s deputies coming to his house. Trump’s push could have a boomerang effect on Republicans The bulk of redistricting normally happens once every 10 years, following the release of new population estimates from the U.S. Census. That requires state lawmakers to adjust their legislative lines to make sure every district has roughly the same population. It also opens the door to gerrymandering maps to make it harder for the party out of power to win legislative seats. Inevitably, redistricting leads to litigation, which can drag on for years and spur mid-decade, court-mandated revisions. Republicans stood to benefit from these after the last cycle in 2021 because they won state supreme court elections in North Carolina and Ohio in 2022. But some litigation hasn’t gone the GOP’s way. A judge in Utah earlier this month required the state to make one of its four congressional seats Democratic-leaning . Trump broke with modern political practice by urging a wholesale, mid-decade redraw in red states. Democrats were in a bad position to respond to Trump’s gambit because more states they control have lines drawn by independent commissions rather than by partisan lawmakers, the legacy of government reform efforts. But with Newsom’s push to let Democrats draw California’s lines successful, the party is looking to replicate it elsewhere. Next up may be Virginia , where Democrats recaptured the governor’s office this month and expanded their margins in the Legislature. A Democratic candidate for governor in Colorado has called for a similar measure there. Republicans currently hold 9 of the 19 House seats in those two states. Overall, Republicans have more to lose if redistricting becomes a purely partisan activity nationally and voters in blue states ditch their nonpartisan commissions to let their preferred party maximize its margins. In the last complete redistricting cycle in 2021, commissions drew 95 House seats that Democrats would have otherwise drawn, and only 13 that Republicans would have drawn.

Pete Sessions of Texas told reporters. Incumbents usually don’t like the idea of radically redrawing districts. It can lead to what political experts call a “dummymander” — spreading the opposing party’s voters so broadly that they end up endangering your own incumbents in a year, like 2026, that is expected to be bad for the party in power. Incumbents also don’t like losing voters who have supported them or getting wholly new communities drawn into their districts, said Jonathan Cervas, who teaches redistricting at Carnegie Mellon University and has drawn new maps for courts. Democratic lawmakers in Illinois and Maryland have so far resisted mid-decade redraws to pad their majorities in their states, joining their GOP counterparts in Indiana and Kansas. Cervas said that’s why it was striking to watch Trump push Republicans to dive into mid-decade redistricting. “The idea they’d go along to get along is basically crazy,” he said. ___ Associated Press

demand and the future of heavy transport. In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year. Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbon-dioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions . Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures. Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport. Related Stories Waymo is hitting the highway.

Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and “in other countries, it might never take off,” he said. Costs fall in China’s electric truck pivot The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World. While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle’s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists . “When it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,” Doleman said. Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models. Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks. Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes. CATL, the world’s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering 150,000 kilometers (about 93,000 miles) out of China’s 184,000 kms (about 114,000 miles) of expressways. Global energy markets will feel the impact The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say. Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration . “The rise of China’s electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,” said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy. LNG truck sales peaked in Sept 2023 and March 2024 after China eased transport restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Liuhanzi Yang of the International Council on Clean Transportation Beijing. By June 2025, sales had slipped 6% as electric trucks gained ground. Shell’s 2025 LNG Outlook projects that demand for imported LNG in China, the world’s largest LNG importer, will continue to rise partly due to LNG trucks. It also suggests LNG trucking might expand to other markets, such as India. China’s electric trucks are already cutting oil demand by the equivalent of more than a million barrels a day, estimates the New York-based research provider Rhodium Group. But Doleman views LNG as a “transitional step” unlikely to be seen apart from in China, where a vast pipeline infrastructure, abundant domestic gas production and byproducts like coke oven gas created conditions conducive to LNG-fueled trucking not seen elsewhere. China is planning new emission standards for vehicles that will limit multiple pollutants and set average greenhouse gas targets across a manufacturer’s fleet. This will make it “almost impossible” for companies relying solely on fossil-fuel vehicles to comply, Yang said. A 2020 ICCT study found LNG-fueled trucks cut emissions by 2%-9% over 100 years but can be more polluting in the short run due to leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide. Modern diesel now nearly matches LNG in air-quality performance. China is eyeing the global electric truck market Already the world’s largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market. Chinese automakers have kept costs down and sped up truck manufacturing while ensuring different parts work seamlessly together with in-house production of most key components, from batteries to motors and electronics, said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Limited. China’s hyperactive delivery industry, particularly urban freight trucks, has been an early proving ground for these vehicles, he noted. In 2021-2023, exports of Chinese heavy-duty trucks including EVs to the Middle East and North Africa grew about 73% annually while shipments to Latin America rose 46%, according to a McKinsey & Company report. The share of electrics is expected to grow, though limited charging infrastructure could pose a challenge. China’s Sany Heavy Industry says it will start exporting its electric trucks to Europe in 2026. It is has already exported some electric trucks to the U.S., Asian countries like Thailand and India, and the the United Arab Emirates, among others. In June, Chinese EV maker BYD broke ground in Hungary for an electric truck and bus factory, with an eye toward a mandatory European target of cutting carbon emissions from new trucks by 90% by 2040 compared to 2019 levels. Prices of zero-emission trucks in Europe must roughly halve to become affordable alternatives to diesel, according to another study in 2024 by McKinsey . Volvo told The Associated Press that it didn’t comment on competitors but welcomed “competition on fair terms,” while Scania did not respond. “Things are shaking up,” Daiss said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

particular, sit on the front lines of much of this development, the rights group said.\n\nBranded the “Great People’s March” by organisers, Saturday’s rally in Belem came at the halfway point of contentious COP30 negotiations.\n\n“Today we are witnessing a massacre as our forest is being destroyed,” Benedito Huni Kuin, a 50-year-old member of the Huni Kuin Indigenous group from western Brazil, told the AFP news agency.\n\n“We want to make our voices heard from  the Amazon  and demand results,” he said. “We need more Indigenous representatives at COP to defend our rights.”\n\nYouth leader Ana Heloisa Alves, 27, said it was the biggest climate march she has participated in. “This is incredible,” she told The Associated Press. “You can’t ignore all these people.”\n\nThe COP30 talks come as  the UN warned  earlier this month that the world was on track to exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) mark of global warming – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “very likely” within the next decade.\n\nIf countries do as they have promised in their climate action plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5C (4.1 to 4.5F) by 2100, a report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found.\n\n“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop,” said UNEP chief Inger Andersen.\n\nDespite that urgency, a nalysts and some COP30 participants have said they don’t expect any major new agreements to emerge from the talks, which conclude on November 21.\n\nStill, some are hoping for progress on some past promises, including  funding to help  poorer countries adapt to climate change."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why

its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/19/israel-kills-at-least-25-palestinians-in-wave-of-gaza-attacks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"22:30:16+00:00","title":"Israel kills at least 28 Palestinians in wave of Gaza ‘ceasefire’ attacks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has launched multiple attacks in Gaza, killing at least 28 Palestinians and wounding 77, in a clear violation of the United States-brokered ceasefire that began on October 10.

Israeli  attacks on the Gaza Strip , medical sources tell Al Jazeera, in one of the largest breaches of the United States-brokered ceasefire that came into effect last month.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said on Wednesday at least 77 Palestinians were also wounded in Israeli bombardment, according to a preliminary toll.\n\nReporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said the  Israeli attacks  targeted three specific sites including southern Gaza’s al-Mawasi area, near Khan Younis.\n\nIsrael also struck a junction in the eastern Gaza City area of Shujayea filled with displaced Palestinian families, and a building in the Zeitoun neighbourhood where at least 10 people – including an entire family – were killed.\n\n“A father, a mother, and their three children were killed inside this building,” said Mahmoud, adding that the intensified attacks are fuelling panic throughout the Gaza Strip.\n\n“Already, Palestinians across Gaza are dealing with daily horrors,” he said, noting Israeli  bombings have not stopped  since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into force on October 10.\n\n“The war is still taking place, and Palestinians are still dying due to the ongoing violence.”\n\nThe Israeli military said it launched Wednesday’s strikes on “Hamas targets” across Gaza in response to an incident in which its troops came under fire in Khan Younis in the south of the territory.\n\n“The [army] will continue to act forcefully to eliminate any threat to the State of Israel,” it said.\n\nBut Hamas rejected the claim that Israel’s forces were fired on, calling it “a flimsy and transparent attempt to justify its crimes and violations” in Gaza.\n\n“We consider this a dangerous escalation through which the war criminal [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu seeks to resume the genocide against our people,” the Palestinian group said in a statement, referring to the latest Israeli attacks.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Nour Odeh also noted that Israel has given itself “the right to be judge, jury and executioner” in the implementation of the truce.\n\n“It judges for itself whether there is compliance by Hamas of this ceasefire [in Gaza] … and if it decides that there is no compliance, Israel wages a series of air strikes against specific targets,” Odeh reported from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.\n\nWednesday’s assault on Gaza coincided with a series of Israeli  attacks on Lebanon , where tensions are rapidly escalating after an Israeli bombing of a Palestinian refugee camp in the south of the country killed more than a dozen people on Tuesday.\n\nIt also came just days after the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)  passed a resolution  backing US President Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, including the deployment of a so-called “international stabilisation force”.\n\nThe resolution also greenlit the establishment of a “board of peace” to oversee governance in the coastal territory, as the US and Israel demand that Hamas relinquish control of Gaza.\n\nHamas and other Palestinian factions in Gaza have  rejected the plan , saying it lays down a framework that goes against “the national will”.\n\nPalestinian human rights group Al-Haq called on UNSC members to vote against the resolution, warning it could lead to the “undermining and rejection of Palestinian self-determination”.\n\nKhaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a US-based think tank, said Israel’s attacks on Gaza challenge “both the international community and the limits” of the  UNSC resolution .\n\n“This is a real test for the [UN] Security Council, for the United States, and for the international community,” Elgindy told Al Jazeera. “Are they going to uphold this ceasefire that they’ve been celebrating now for many weeks?”\n\nSupporters of the US-backed UN resolution argued it would help bring a lasting halt to Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed nearly 70,000 Palestinians since

indictment\n\nThe United States Department of Justice has acknowledged that the grand jury reviewing the case against James Comey, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), did not receive a copy of the final indictment against him.\n\nThat revelation on Wednesday came as lawyers for Comey sought to have the indictment thrown out of court.\n\nAt a 90-minute hearing in a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, Comey’s lawyers argued that the case should be dismissed outright, not only for the prosecutorial missteps but also due to the interventions of President Donald Trump.\n\nComey is one of three prominent Trump critics to be indicted between late September and mid-October.\n\nThe hearing took place before US District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, and Comey’s defence team alleged that Trump was using the legal system as a tool for political retribution.\n\n“This is an extraordinary case and it merits an extraordinary remedy,” defence lawyer Michael Dreeben said, calling the indictment “a blatant use of criminal justice to achieve political ends”.\n\nThe Justice Department, represented by prosecutor Tyler Lemons, maintained that the indictment met the legal threshold to be heard at trial.\n\nBut Lemons did admit, under questioning, that the grand jury that approved the indictment had not seen its final draft.\n\nWhen Judge Nachmanoff asked Lemons if the grand jury had never seen the final version, the prosecutor conceded, “That is my understanding.”\n\nIt was the latest stumble in the Justice Department’s efforts to prosecute Comey for allegedly obstructing a congressional investigation and lying to senators while under oath.\n\nComey has pleaded not guilty to the two charges, and his defence team has led a multipronged effort to see the case nixed over its multiple irregularities.\n\nQuestions over the indictment — and what the grand jury had or had not seen — had been brewing since last week.\n\nOn November 13, US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie  raised questions  about a span of time when it appeared that there appeared to be “no court reporter present” during the grand jury proceedings.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick took the  extraordinary step  of calling for the grand jury materials to be released to the Comey defence team, citing “a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps”.\n\nThey included misleading statements from prosecutors, the use of search warrants pertaining to a separate case, and the fact that the grand jury likely did not review the final indictment in full.\n\nSeparately, in Wednesday’s hearing, Judge Nachmanoff pressed acting US Attorney Lindsey Halligan about who saw the final indictment.\n\nAfter repeated questions, she, too, admitted that only the foreperson of the grand jury and a second grand juror were present for the returning of the indictment.\n\nHalligan oversaw the three indictments against the Trump critics: Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and former National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\nAll three have denied wrongdoing, and all three have argued that their prosecution is part of a campaign of political vengeance.\n\nWednesday’s hearing focused primarily on establishing that argument, with Comey’s lawyers pointing to statements Trump made pushing for the indictments.\n\nComey’s defence team pointed to the tense relationship between their client and Trump, stretching back to the president’s decision to fire Comey from his job as FBI director in 2017.\n\nComey had faced bipartisan criticism for FBI investigations into the 2016 election, which Trump ultimately won.\n\nTrump, for example, accused the ex-FBI leader of going easy on his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, calling him a “slime ball”, a “phony” and “a real nut job”.\n\n“FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds,” Trump wrote on social media in May 2017.\n\nComey, meanwhile, quickly established himself as a prominent critic of the Trump administration.\n\n“I don’t think he’s medically unfit to be president. I think he’s morally unfit to be president,” Comey told ABC News in 2018.\n\nHe added that a president must “embody respect” and adhere to basic values like truth-telling. “This president is not able to do that,” Comey said.\n\nIn Wednesday’s hearing, Comey’s defence also pointed to the series of events leading up to the former FBI director’s indictment.\n\nLast September, Trump  posted  on social media a message to Attorney General Pam Bondi, calling Comey and James “guilty as hell” and encouraging her not to “delay any longer” in seeking their indictments.\n\nThat message was “effectively an admission that this is a political prosecution”, according to Dreeben, Comey’s lawyer.\n\nShortly after the message was posted online, Halligan was appointed as acting US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia\n\nShe replaced a prosecutor, Erik Siebert, who had reportedly declined to indict Comey and others for lack of evidence. Trump had denounced him as a “woke RINO”, an acronym that stands for “Republican in name only”.\n\nDreeben argued that switcheroo also signalled Trump’s vindictive intent and his spearheading of the Comey indictment.\n\nBut Lemons, representing the Justice Department, told Judge Nachmanoff that Comey “was not indicted at the direction of the president of the United States or any other government official”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/19/trump-pledges-cooperation-and-coordination-to-end-sudans-civil-war","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"21:54:09+00:00","title":"Trump pledges ‘cooperation and coordination’ to end Sudan’s civil war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent development, U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to intervene in Sudan’s ongoing civil war, which began in April 2023, following a direct appeal from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

pledges ‘cooperation and coordination’ to end Sudan’s civil war\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has pledged to address the conflict in Sudan, in response to an apparent request from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced his intention to intervene twice, once at the Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, DC, and a second time on his online platform, Truth Social.\n\n“Arab Leaders from all over the World, in particular the highly respected Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, who has just left the United States, have asked me to use the power and influence of the Presidency to bring an immediate halt to what is taking place in Sudan,” Trump  wrote .\n\n“It is considered a Great Civilization and Culture, unfortunately gone bad, but one that can be fixed with the cooperation and coordination of Countries.”\n\nAt the investment forum, Trump relayed how the crown prince appealed to him personally for assistance.\n\n“He mentioned Sudan yesterday, and he said, ‘Sir, you’re talking about a lot of wars, but there’s a place on Earth called Sudan, and it’s horrible what’s happening,'” Trump said.\n\nThe US president added that his administration had “already started working” on the issue within a half-hour of the crown prince’s request.\n\nTrump  had hosted  Prince Mohammed, better known by his initials MBS, in Washington, DC, this week for the crown prince’s first official visit since 2018.  The trip was marked  by mutual praise between the two leaders and the promise of increased US-Saudi investments.\n\nPrince Mohammed concluded his two-day trip on Wednesday after the business forum.\n\nTrump, who has long lobbied for the Nobel Peace Prize, said he would collaborate with Saudi Arabia and other Arab partners to achieve a resolution to the conflict in Sudan.\n\n“We will work with Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and other Middle Eastern partners to get these atrocities to end, while at the same time stabilizing Sudan,” Trump wrote in his post.\n\nThe civil war in Sudan erupted in April 2023, as the government-controlled Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) clashed with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for control of areas including the capital Khartoum.\n\nThe result has been widespread bloodshed, displacement and famine. The United Nations documented at least 3,384 civilian deaths between January and June of this year, putting the country on track to surpass the civilian death toll for all of 2024, which hit 4,238.\n\nA UN-backed analysis declared famine in two war-torn cities,  el-Fasher  and Kadugli, this month. Approximately 45 percent of the population faces  acute food insecurity  as a result of the conflict.\n\nThe fighting has forced more than four million people to flee Sudan, heightening instability in the region. Within Sudan, the UN has documented evidence of mass executions, ethnic violence and sexual violence being used as a weapon of war.\n\nTom Fletcher, the top UN official for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief,  recently posted about his trip to el-Fasher , calling the city a “crime scene” after it fell to RSF forces last month.\n\nSudan has suffered three internal wars within the last 40 years alone, with previous conflicts stretching from 1955 to 1972 and from 1983 to 2005.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has sought to brand himself as the “peace president”, despite an  expanding bombing campaign  in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nHe said in his second inaugural address in January: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.”\n\nTrump and his allies  claim  the US president has ended “eight wars in eight months”, although critics question whether the peace deals he has struck will last.\n\nIn some cases, attacks have continued, as is the case with  Israel’s war in Gaza , which UN experts consider a genocide. In the case of Egypt and Ethiopia, critics argue there was no war to end, although  tensions  have long simmered between the two countries.\n\nStill, leaders of several of the countries involved — including Israel, Armenia and Azerbaijan — have pledged to nominate Trump for his much sought-after Nobel Prize.\n\nIn the case of Sudan, Trump highlighted the dire humanitarian needs of the civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\n“Food, doctors, and everything else are desperately needed,” he wrote on Wednesday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/19/new-us-peace-plan-for-ukraine-involves-kyiv-ceding-land-weapons-reports","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:57:39+00:00","title":"New US peace plan for Ukraine involves Kyiv ceding land, weapons: Reports","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States has proposed a new peace plan for Ukraine that requires Kyiv to cede the remainder of the Donbas region, reduce its armed forces by half, abandon certain weapons, and accept Russian as an official language and the Ukrainian division of the Russian Orthodox Church as officially recognized.

Witkoff in a meeting with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, in Miami, Florida in the US this week.\n\nUnder the proposal, Ukraine would be required to cede the remainder of the  eastern region of Donbas , including territory under Kyiv’s control, and cut the size of its armed forces by half, it said.\n\nReuters news agency, citing sources informed on the matter, also reported the proposal would include cutting the size of Ukraine’s military.\n\nThe proposed framework would require Kyiv to abandon certain categories of weaponry, the Times said, and would see US military assistance to the country rolled back.\n\nAmong other requirements of the plan, Russian would be recognised as an official state language in Ukraine, while official status would be granted to the Ukrainian division of the Russian Orthodox Church, the newspaper reported.\n\nRussia said contacts with the US continue, but there are no new developments to announce on a possible peace plan to end the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nIn an interview with Russian state news agency TASS, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that while Moscow has followed numerous publications “describing various processes”, such reports should be assessed based on official communication rather than media narratives.\n\n“There are official channels in the United States for resolving these issues, discussing them, and negotiating processes. These channels must be utilized,” Zakharova said. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received any information from the American side in this context.”\n\nNo direct talks have taken place between Kyiv and Moscow since a meeting in Istanbul, Turkiye in July that failed to yield a breakthrough, although it resulted in prisoner of war (POW) exchanges between the countries.\n\nOn Sunday,  Zelenskyy said  he was “counting on the resumption” of further such exchanges after Umerov said consultations mediated by Turkiye and the United Arab Emirates were held on resuming the POW swaps.\n\nZelenskyy was in Turkiye on Wednesday for talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who urged Ukraine and Russia to return to Istanbul to resume their negotiations.\n\n“In today’s meetings we … emphasised the need for the Istanbul process to continue with a pragmatic and results-oriented approach,” Erdogan told a news conference alongside Zelenskyy in Ankara.\n\n“We also expect all our partners who wish to see the bloodshed in the region come to an end to adopt a constructive approach toward the Istanbul process.”\n\nDespite international condemnation Russia has pressed on with its attacks on Ukraine with at least  25 people killed  and dozens wounded in the latest drone and missile attacks on Wednesday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/19/in-colombia-petro-fends-off-criticism-over-killing-of-child-rebel-recruits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:56:36+00:00","title":"In Colombia, Petro fends off criticism over killing of child rebel recruits","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Colombia, President Gustavo Petro faces mounting criticism over the deaths of at least 12 underage recruits in a recent military campaign targeting the Estado Mayor Central (EMC), a dissident group that recruits minors as human shields.

recruits\n\nBogota, Colombia –  Eight underage rebel recruits were killed last week after the Colombian government launched a fresh military offensive against a prominent armed group, according to President  Gustavo Petro .\n\nThe news comes amid  soaring child recruitment  by Colombia’s armed groups in recent years and has ignited a debate over whether forced recruits can be protected on the battlefield.\n\nIn a Monday  post  on the social media platform X, President Petro confirmed that seven adolescents were killed in a government bombing campaign in the southern Guaviare department on November 10.\n\nAnother minor was killed three days later, on November 13, in a government offensive in the eastern department of Arauca.\n\nThose deaths bring the total number of teenage fatalities to at least 12 in under two months.\n\n“All of them were victims of forced recruitment by criminals who have dragged them into hostilities and deprived them of protection,” Petro, himself a former rebel, wrote in his post.\n\nBut the question of how to protect child recruits is a controversial one in Colombia, where armed actors have increasingly sought to exploit minors.\n\nFor more than six decades, an armed conflict has roiled Colombia, pitting government forces against right-wing paramilitaries, left-wing rebels and criminal groups.\n\nOfficial government statistics suggest that those groups have sought to grow their ranks by appealing to people under the age of 18 — and in some cases, coercing them into work.\n\nAccording to the government, the number of child recruits has increased by 1,000 percent from 2021 to 2024.\n\nThat uptick was echoed in a June report from the United Nations. It determined that, from 2022 to 2024, there were 474 confirmed cases of armed groups using or recruiting minors.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, the office received allegations of a further 118 child recruits.\n\nSome of the victims, the report added, were as young as nine years old. Many were from Colombia’s Indigenous communities.\n\nThe latest casualties come as Petro’s government intensifies its counterinsurgency against the Estado Mayor Central (EMC), a dissident group that splintered off from the now-demobilised Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).\n\nElizabeth Dickinson, the deputy director for Latin America at the International Crisis Group, a think tank, said that the EMC is notable for drawing on children to bolster its ranks.\n\n“The EMC, particularly, is perhaps the group that’s most responsible or most guilty of recruiting minors in recent years,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nShe explained that the group uses children as “human shields”, deploying them around the perimeter of its commanders’ positions.\n\nBut how the government approaches military actions that may harm child recruits has drawn criticism in Colombia.\n\nThe country is facing a key presidential election in 2026, and Petro’s left-wing government has faced backlash for the recent string of deaths.\n\nAlready, the opposition has seized upon the killing of child recruits as a potential violation of international humanitarian law.\n\nLawmakers in Congress have proposed a motion of censure against Defence Minister Pedro Sanchez for the deaths.\n\nSome, including Representative Katherine Miranda, have called for Sanchez to resign immediately.\n\nOn social media this week, Miranda also  directed  an appeal to Petro: “Face the country and answer for the state crime you are committing against children who are victims of forced recruitment.”\n\nDickinson at the International Crisis Group told Al Jazeera that child recruits are not without protection under international law, as Petro’s recent post might suggest.\n\n“That is not correct,” Dickinson said. “These are victims of conflict. They are children. They were forcibly recruited.”\n\nThe Geneva Convention, for instance, requires state parties to “take all feasible measures” to ensure that child recruits under age 15 are not involved in hostilities.\n\n“Children are simply a reality in the conflict today,” said Dickinson. “And so the government has to take that on board if they are engaging in bombardments.”\n\nHilda Molano, a coordinator at the Coalition Against the Involvement of Children and Young People in the Armed Conflict in Colombia (COALICO), said it can be difficult to attribute blame for the deaths of child recruits in combat.\n\nBut she called on all parties to take the rights of children into account, despite the complicated situation.\n\n“In cases like these, it is clear that no single party is responsible; ultimately, it is a shared responsibility,” Molano told Al Jazeera.\n\nMolano called for the Colombian government to do more to deter child recruitment and to improve its presence in conflict zones.\n\nChildren in conflict zones, she said, face “the double risk” of being recruited by armed groups and being killed by state security forces.\n\nThe Petro government, meanwhile, has maintained that its actions adhere to international laws for the protection of children.\n\nAl Jazeera has reached out to the Ministry of Defence for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.\n\nOn social media, the president  claimed  his efforts had already led to the release of 2,411 minors.\n\n“Peace is the best way to prevent children from being involved in war,” he wrote.\n\nHe also confirmed his government’s plans to continue its campaign against the EMC, which has been responsible for a wave of car bombs and drone attacks targeting military and police installations this year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Petro dismissed calls to cease the government strikes,  writing  on X: “To say that the bombings should stop when we are within IHL [international humanitarian law] is brutally naive.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/19/family-demands-independent-medical-care-for-us-teen-detained-by-israel","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"22:39:12+00:00","title":"Family demands independent medical care for US teen detained by Israel","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian American boy, has been detained by Israel since February 2023 and remains in Ofer Prison without release, despite reports of severe health deterioration including weight loss, scabies, and mental health decline.

American boy who has been detained by Israel since February, is demanding that an independent doctor assess the teenager’s condition amid alarming reports about his situation in prison.\n\nMohammed’s uncle, Zeyad Kadur, said an official from the United States embassy in Israel visited the 16-year-old last week at Ofer Prison.\n\nThe official told the family afterwards that Ibrahim had lost weight and dark circles were forming around his eyes, Kadur told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe consular officer also said he had raised Mohammed’s case with multiple US and Israeli agencies.\n\n“This is the first time in nine months that they showed grave concern for his health, so how bad is it?” Kadur asked in an interview on Wednesday.\n\nDespite rights groups and  US lawmakers  pleading for Mohammed’s release, Israel has refused to free him, and his family said the administration of President Donald Trump is not doing enough to bring him home.\n\nIsraeli authorities have accused Ibrahim of throwing rocks at settlers in the occupied West Bank, an allegation he denies.\n\nBut the legal proceedings in the case are moving at a snail’s pace in Israel’s military justice system, according to Mohammed’s family.\n\nRights advocates also say that the military court system in the occupied West Bank is part of Israel’s discriminatory  apartheid regime , given its conviction rate of nearly 100 percent for Palestinian defendants.\n\nAdding to the Ibrahim family’s angst is the lack of access to the teenager while Mohammed is in Israeli prison. Unable to visit him or communicate with him, his relatives are only able to receive updates from the US embassy.\n\nThe teenager has been suffering from severe weight loss while in detention, his father, Zaher Ibrahim, told Al Jazeera earlier this year. He also contracted scabies, a contagious skin infection.\n\nThe last visit he received from US embassy staff was in September.\n\nIsraeli authorities have committed  well-documented abuses  against Palestinian detainees, including torture and sexual violence, especially after the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023.\n\n“We hear and see people getting out of prison and what they look like, and we know it’s bad,” Kadur said.\n\n“Mohammed is an American kid who was taken at 15. He is now 16, and he’s been sitting there for nine months and hasn’t seen his mom, hasn’t seen his dad.”\n\nHe added that the family is also concerned about Mohammed’s mental health.\n\n“We’re requesting that he gets sent to a hospital and evaluated by a third party, not by a prison medic or nurse. He needs some actual attention,” Mohammed’s uncle told Al Jazeera.\n\nMohammed, who is from Florida, was visiting Palestine when in the middle of the night he was arrested, blindfolded and beaten in what Kadur described as a “kidnapping”.\n\nThe US Department of State did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the latest consular visit to Mohammed.\n\nWhen Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Israel last month, he appeared to have misheard a question about Palestinian prisoner  Marwan Barghouti  and thought it was about Mohammed’s case.\n\n“Are you talking about the one from the US? I don’t have any news for you on that today,” Rubio told reporters.\n\n“Obviously, we’ll work that through our embassy here and our diplomatic channels, but we don’t have anything to announce on that.”\n\nBut for Kadur, Mohammed’s case is not a bureaucratic or legal matter – it is one that requires political will from Washington to secure his freedom.\n\nKadur underscored that the US has negotiated with adversaries, including  Venezuela ,  Russia  and  North Korea , to free detained Americans, so it can push for the release of Mohammed from its closest ally in the Middle East.\n\nThe US provided Israel with more than  $21bn in military aid  over the past two years.\n\nKadur drew a contrast between the lack of US effort to free Mohammed and the push to release Edan Alexander, a US citizen who was volunteering in the Israeli army and was taken prisoner during Hamas’s attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.\n\nAlexander was released  in May after pressure from the Trump administration on Hamas.\n\n“The American government negotiated with what they consider a terrorist organisation, and they secured his release – an adult who put on a uniform, who picked up a gun and did what he signed up for,” Kadur said of Alexander.\n\n“Why is a 16-year-old still there for nine months, rotting away, deteriorating in a prison? That’s one example to show that Mohammed – and his name and his Palestinian DNA – [are] not considered American enough by the State Department first and by the administration second.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/19/its-israeli-policy-report-reveals-abuse-of-palestinians-in-prisons","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"18:43:08Z","title":"‘It’s Israeli policy’: Report reveals abuse of Palestinians in prisons","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A report by Physicians for Human Rights-Israel (PHRI) reveals a systemic pattern of torture, abuse, and neglect within Israel’s prison system, resulting in at least 94 deaths of Palestinian detainees since 2023.

Palestinians in prisons\n\nFor Palestinians held within Israel’s prison network, torture, abuse and contempt for life isn’t just the norm, it’s the system.\n\nThat’s according to  report released this week [PDF]  by the NGO Physicians for Human Rights-Israel (PHRI).\n\nIn the report, PHRI reveals the details of at least 94 Palestinian prisoners killed while in Israeli detention. The true number is likely far higher, the report’s authors concede. All of those killed died from either torture, assault, wilful medical neglect or malnutrition.\n\nThe report builds upon a tranche of evidence of  abuse and torture  published by a variety of human rights organisations, both inside Israel and internationally.\n\n“It’s not just [far-right National Security Minister Itamar] Ben-Gvir’s policy, it’s an Israeli policy directed against Palestinians in Israeli custody, in military and civilian deterioration facilities alike,” one of the report’s authors, Oneg Ben Dror, told Al Jazeera.\n\nIncluded in the  testimonials [PDF]  is the case of 33-year-old Abd al-Rahman Mar’i from the occupied West Bank, whose body – a latticework of bruises, contusions and fractures – was returned to his family after he died in Megiddo prison in November 2023.\n\nAnother prisoner, 17-year-old Walid Khaled Abdullah Ahmad from Nablus, was returned to his family with his body having next to no muscle or fat remaining, despite his family saying that he had been an athlete before his arrest in September 2024. A post-mortem revealed that Walid died six months after his arrest, with post-mortem findings indicating he had suffered “severe and prolonged malnutrition”.\n\nYet another detainee, 25-year-old Arafat Hamdan from the occupied West Bank village of Beit Sira, only lasted two days in military custody before he died. A type 1 diabetic, Arafat needed regular insulin injections to stay alive. Witnesses to Arafat’s death report him being brutally beaten and his medication withheld.\n\nTestimonies, official records, and extensive evidence collected by PHRI and other organisations indicate that, alongside Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, there has been an unparalleled campaign of assault against detained Palestinians.\n\nIsrael is thought to have arrested more than 18,500 Palestinians since the war on Gaza began in October 2023. Many of those have fallen victim to the kind of routine abuse documented by rights groups such as Human Rights Watch (HRW), the Israel-based B’Tselem, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR).\n\nIn addition to the thousands whose detention has been documented, there are an unknown number taken as part of an Israeli policy of enforced disappearances in the first few months of the war, legalised through Israel’s  Unlawful Combatants Law .\n\nTwo years on, many of those disappeared may no longer be alive. “Thousands of Palestinians from Gaza are unaccounted for; of those, hundreds were reported to have been taken by the Israeli military. The concern is that many of them are no longer alive,” Ben Dror said.\n\nAccusations  that Israel has been torturing its prisoners, including United Nations staff, have run almost the length of the war. In August 2024, B’Tselem  issued its report  on the Israeli prison system titled “Welcome to Hell”, detailing the physical, psychological and sexual abuse meted out to Palestinians taken into Israeli custody.\n\nBoth PHRI and HRW have also previously investigated the specific torture of healthcare workers by the Israeli military in stark contravention of international law.  Among other  instances  of the brutal treatment were threats to cut prisoners’ hands off because “they were dentists” and forcing doctors to bray like donkeys.\n\nIsrael has previously stated that it treats Palestinian prisoners in accordance with international law.\n\n“Sde Teiman is the only case that has reached the Israeli public, but we are aware of many more,” Ben Dror said of the gang rape of a Palestinian man in the  Sde Teiman military prison  in July 2024 whose prosecution, if not perpetration, has  divided Israeli society .\n\n“Sde Teiman was only reported because the injuries were so extensive that the victim had to be admitted to a public hospital, where a large number of people became aware of the case,” she continued.\n\nNone of the other reports of rape and sexual abuse carried out against Palestinian prisoners – such as the suspected,  and ultimately fatal, rape  of Dr Adnan al-Bursh in Ofer prison in March 2024 – have gained much attention within Israel.\n\nInstead, politicians such as Ben-Gvir, who has responsibility for Israel’s prison system, are confident enough to actively boast of ensuring that prisoners’ food is reduced to the “minimum of the minimum”, despite a July  report  from the Palestinian rights group Addameer documenting what researchers termed the drastic and deliberate reduction in quantities of food and water allowed to prisoners.\n\n“Haaretz tends to cover these things, but that’s about it,” Israeli political analyst Nimrod Flaschenberg said, referring to the popular liberal Israeli news outlet. “But if I look at the coverage given to this latest [PHRI] report, there’s nothing. Maybe a few individual leftist websites have picked it up, but that’s it.”\n\n“People just don’t know. I’m not saying if they did know there’d be any great moral outcry, but there’d be something,” he continued. “For now, statements like those from Ben-Gvir on prison conditions are popular. He wouldn’t say them if they weren’t.”\n\nNevertheless, despite the overwhelming evidence of abuse within Israel’s prison network, in late October, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz renewed the ban on allowing international agencies, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to inspect its prisons.\n\n“Horrific reports on the treatment of Palestinians in detention have been met with inaction and ignored, with Israel blocking ICRC access and independent oversight,” Milena Ansari from HRW said. “This isn’t about isolated abuses, but a broader pattern carried out with impunity. Without accountability, the violence will only deepen, and more deaths in Israeli detention will continue to emerge.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/brazils-lula-faces-obstacles-in-push-for-agreement-at-climate-summit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"01:37:05+00:00","title":"Brazil’s Lula faces obstacles in push for agreement at climate summit","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is leading efforts to build international unity in climate action, especially in the absence of the United States.

visit’ to seized territory\n\nSyria has denounced a trip by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials to the country’s south, where they visited troops deployed to Syrian territory they’ve occupied for months.\n\nIsrael expanded its occupation of southern Syrian territory as the regime of former President Bashar al-Assad was overrun by rebel forces in December.\n\n“My government strongly condemns this provocative tour, which epitomises Israel’s ongoing aggression against Syria and its people,” Ibrahim Olabi, Syria’s ambassador to the United Nations, told the UN Security Council on Wednesday.\n\n“We renew our call on the UN and this council to take firm and immediate action to halt these violations, ensure their non-reoccurrence, end the occupation and enforce relevant resolutions, particularly the 1974 disengagement agreement” that followed the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.\n\nSince the overthrow of al-Assad, Israel has kept troops in a UN-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights separating Israeli and Syrian forces.\n\nUN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric described Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials’ “very public visit” as “concerning, to say the least”.\n\nDujarric noted that UN Resolution 2799, recently passed by the Security Council, “called for the full sovereignty, unity, independence, and territorial integrity of Syria”.\n\nIsrael has previously said the 1974 agreement has been void since al-Assad fled, and it has breached Syrian sovereignty with air strikes, ground infiltration operations, reconnaissance overflights, the establishment of checkpoints, and the arrest and disappearance of Syrian citizens.\n\nSyria has not reciprocated the attacks.\n\nDuring the Security Council meeting, Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, did not directly address Netanyahu’s visit but instead lectured Syria’s ambassador.\n\n“Show us that Syria is moving away from extremism and radicalism, that the protection of Christians and Jews is not an afterthought but a priority. Show us that the militias are restrained and justice is real and the cycle of indiscriminate killings has ended,” Danon said.\n\nOlabi responded: “The proving, Mr Ambassador, tends to be on your shoulders. You have struck Syria more than 1,000 times, and we have responded with requests for diplomacy … and responded with zero signs of aggression towards Israel. … We have engaged constructively. and we still await for you to do the same.”\n\nNetanyahu was accompanied to Syrian territory by Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, Defence Minister Israel Katz, army Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir and the head of the Shin Bet security service, David Zini\n\nSyria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates condemned “in the strongest terms the illegal visit, … considering it a serious violation of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.\n\nThis month, Israel’s army renewed its incursions into Syria, setting up a military checkpoint in the southern province of Quneitra.\n\nIn September, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said Israel had conducted more than 1,000 air strikes and more than 400 ground incursions in Syria since al-Assad was overthrown, describing the actions as “very dangerous”.\n\nReporting from the UN in New York, Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo noted Syria and Israel continue to negotiate a security pact that analysts said could be finalised before the end of the year.\n\n“The testy exchange between the two ambassadors likely won’t derail that. But it does show how little trust there is between both countries – and how Netanyahu and his government continue to try to provoke Damascus,” Elizondo said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/trump-says-he-signed-bill-to-release-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"01:32:46+00:00","title":"Trump says he signed bill to release Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, President Donald Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a bipartisan congressional law requiring the U.S. Department of Justice to release all unclassified files related to Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days.

ordering the release of files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump made the announcement on social media late on Wednesday after months of pressure on his administration to disclose the full extent of Epstein’s crimes and his connections to elites in politics, business and entertainment.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi had earlier told a news conference that the administration would “follow the law” and “encourage maximum transparency” in the case.\n\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed the US Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support this week, compels the US Department of Justice to release all unclassified materials related to the disgraced financier in a “searchable and downloadable format” within 30 days.\n\nThe legislation includes provisions allowing authorities to withhold child sex exploitation material and victims’ identifying details as well as information that concerns active investigations or “national defense or foreign policy”.\n\nBut the text also stipulates that no record should be withheld on the basis of “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary”.\n\nWhile thousands of files related to Epstein have been made public, a judge who presided over a case involving the financier earlier this year said the total trove of files came to roughly 100,000 pages.\n\nEpstein’s numerous elite connections, enormous wealth and mysterious background have fuelled speculation and conspiracy theories for years.\n\nOfficial explanations, including a joint memo by Trump’s Justice Department and FBI that concluded there was not evidence to support the prosecution of Epstein associates, have repeatedly failed to quell public intrigue in the case.\n\nIn announcing the move to release the files, Trump, who had resisted calls for greater transparency in the case, sought to cast the controversy around Epstein as a greater liability for Democrats than his fellow Republicans.\n\nWriting on his platform Truth Social, Trump called Epstein a “lifelong” Democrat and noted his associations with high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who on Wednesday took leave from teaching at Harvard University amid the fallout of emails detailing his friendly relationship with the late financier.\n\nNeither Clinton nor Summers have been implicated in any criminal wrongdoing in their associations with Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges.\n\n“Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nEpstein’s associations spanned the political aisle, including prominent Republicans as well as Democrats.\n\nTrump was himself friendly with Epstein during the 1990s and early 2000s, and his name featured prominently in Epstein emails released by US lawmakers this month.\n\nIn one email sent in 2011, Epstein told his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump had “spent hours” at his home with a sex trafficking victim.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing and repeatedly insisted he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes.\n\nAfter Trump’s announcement, critics raised doubts that his administration would follow through on its commitment to transparency in the case.\n\nUS Senator Adam Schiff, a Democrat who represents California, said he was “not at all confident” that the legislation would be implemented as written.\n\n“I think if past is prelude, what we can expect is more stonewalling, more cover-up, more inartful ways of explaining why they’re covering up,” Schiff said in an interview with MS NOW host Chris Hayes.\n\n“I think when this chapter of history is written, it will be a test case in how not to handle a crisis.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/psgs-achraf-hakimi-voted-african-footballer-of-the-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"01:06:12+00:00","title":"PSG’s

after their dinghy set sail off the Libyan coast.\n\nAt least 29 of them were Sudanese refugees who fled the catastrophic civil war in their country between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the regular army known as the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF).\n\nSince erupting in April 2023, the Sudan war has caused the largest displacement crisis in the world.\n\nNearly 13 million people have been uprooted from their homes and  more than four million have fled to neighbouring countries , such as Chad, Egypt and Libya.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR),  more than 86,000 Sudanese nationals  are registered as asylum seekers or refugees in Libya – a 60,000 uptick compared with before the war.\n\nAs more Sudanese attempt to reach Europe from Libya, this is everything you need to know about their plight.\n\nFrom April 2023 to January 2024, the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) registered nearly 10,000 asylum applications from Sudanese nationals across the European Union – nearly twice as high as the previous year.\n\nWhile figures for 2025 have not yet been published, the growing number of Sudanese nationals arriving in Libya suggests that more people are aiming to reach Europe as their final destination.\n\n“I hope to soon take the journey across the sea to Europe,” Hamid, a Sudanese refugee from Khartoum, told Al Jazeera from Libya, where he arrived earlier this year.\n\n“Hopefully, God will make the journey safe,” he added with resignation.\n\nOnly a minority of the 10,000 Sudanese asylum seekers have been granted protection so far, with the rest either rejected or waiting for a ruling.\n\nIn general, life has not been easy for many young Sudanese men after reaching Europe.\n\nSome EU states are using anti-smuggling laws to criminalise young men for steering the small and overcrowded boats that smugglers put them in.\n\nIn Greece, more than 200 Sudanese minors and young men between the ages of 15 and 21 are facing smuggling charges.\n\nSome have already been convicted and sentenced to decades or life in prison, pushing their lawyers to appeal.\n\nMigration experts have long explained that vulnerable youth often agree to “steer” boats in exchange for a discounted price from smugglers, who often charge thousands of dollars from destitute asylum seekers looking for safety.\n\nThe RSF, which has committed countless atrocities throughout the war, emerged from the nomadic “Arab” government-linked Janjaweed militias that spearheaded a brutal campaign in the far western region of Darfur at the turn of the millennium.\n\nThose militias were later accused of carrying out countless war crimes and crimes against humanity against mainly sedentary “non-Arab” communities.\n\nMany legal scholars and human rights groups believe the atrocities may have amounted to genocide.\n\nYet in 2013, Sudan’s then-President Omar al-Bashir repackaged many of the Popular Defence Forces militias into the RSF.\n\nThe RSF, looking to acquire international legitimacy, quickly portrayed itself as a possible partner in the EU’s mission to “manage migration” in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa.\n\nIn 2014, the EU announced that it was launching the “Khartoum Process”, an initiative that strengthened cooperation between the EU and East African nations to counter irregular migration.\n\nAbout  $200m was pumped into Sudan over the next five years  for this purpose.\n\nAccording to  research carried out by Sudan expert Suliman Baldo  in 2017, a portion of this money went to strengthening the judiciary and law enforcement and may have possibly been diverted towards the RSF.\n\nThe EU has long denied that it financed the RSF in any capacity.\n\nWhen Sudan’s security forces – including the RSF – killed more than 120 pro-democracy protesters in the capital Khartoum on June 3, 2019, the EU suspended all migration cooperation.\n\nAt the time, Sudan expert Alex de Waal said the EU’s reaction was “ basically an admission of guilt ” that the RSF had benefitted politically and financially from the Khartoum Process."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/meta-sets-date-to-remove-australians-under-16-from-instagram-facebook","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"03:54:24+00:00","title":"Meta

giant said it would start removing teenagers and children from its platforms ahead of the new Australian social media ban on users under 16 coming into effect on December 10.\n\nThe Australian government is preparing to enforce the law with fines of up to 49.5 million Australian Dollars (US$32 million) for social media companies even as critics say the changes have been rushed through without addressing questions around privacy, and the effects on young people’s mental health and access to information.\n\n“From today, Meta will be notifying Australian users it understands to be

expressed concerns about the implementation of the new ban, including journalist and founder of youth news service 6 News Australia Leo Puglisi, 18, who told an Australian senate inquiry that young people “deeply care” about the ban and its potential implications.\n\nPuglisi says that many of the people who engage with 6 News are young people who find their content on social media.\n\n“I think young people do have the right to be informed,” he told the inquiry.\n\n“We’re saying that a 15 year old can’t access any news or political information on social media. I just don’t think that that adds up.”\n\nAustralian Senator David Shoebridge, has expressed concerns that “an estimated 2.4 million young people will be kicked off social media accounts… just as school holidays start.”\n\n“I’m deeply concerned about the impacts on the ban including on young people’s mental health and privacy,” Shoebridge wrote in a recent post on X.\n\nJohn Pane, from Electronic Frontiers Australia, also told a senate inquiry that the new legislation creates new risks, while trying to address other issues.\n\nWhile Pane acknowledged the ban seeks to address young people potentially seeing “unsuitable content” online, he says it also creates a new “far greater, systemic risk” of “potential mass collection of children’s and adults’ identity data.”\n\nThis will further increase “the data stores and financial positions of big tech and big data and increasing cyber risk on a very significant scale,” Pane said.\n\nSince most Australians aged under 16 don’t yet have official government ID, social media companies are planning to require some users to verify their age by recording videos of themselves.\n\nThere is keen interest in whether Australia’s sweeping restrictions can work as regulators around the globe wrestle with the mixed dangers and benefits of social media.\n\nIn New Zealand, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is planning to introduce a similar bill to restrict children’s social media use.\n\nIndonesia has also said it is preparing legislation to  protect young people  from “physical, mental, or moral perils”.\n\nIn Europe, the Dutch government has advised parents to forbid children under 15 from using social media apps like TikTok and Snapchat."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/uk-accuses-russian-spy-ship-of-pointing-lasers-at-pilots-watching-vessel","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:50:25+00:00","title":"UK accuses Russian spy ship of pointing lasers at pilots watching vessel","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Kingdom has issued a formal warning that it is prepared to use military measures against a Russian spy ship, the Yantar, after it was accused of directing lasers at Royal Air Force pilots monitoring its movements near UK waters.

Russian spy ship that has spent weeks on the edge of British waters directed lasers at British pilots sent to monitor the vessel.\n\nIn a speech in London on Wednesday, British Defence Secretary John Healey condemned the Yantar’s actions against royal air force (RAF) pilots as “deeply dangerous” and said Britain is poised to react depending on the vessel’s next move.\n\nThe defence secretary said a UK naval frigate and RAF P-8 planes had been deployed to monitor the ship, which is designed for intelligence gathering and mapping undersea cables, as it sailed in waters north of Scotland.\n\n“My message to Russia and to [President Vladimir] Putin is this: We see you. We know what you’re doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready,” Healey said.\n\n“This is the first time we’ve had this action from Yantar directed against the British RAF. We take it extremely seriously,” he added.\n\nHealey continued that he had changed the navy’s rules of engagement to allow it to “monitor more closely” the vessel’s activities.\n\n“We have military options ready should the Yantar change course,” he said.\n\nBritain’s air and naval forces routinely shadow potential threats near its territorial waters and airspace. Incursions by Russian vessels and submarines have become more frequent since Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nIn a statement responding to Healey’s accusations, the Russian embassy in London accused the British government of being “Russophobic” and “whipping up militaristic hysteria”.\n\nResponding to what it described as “endless accusations”, it said Moscow’s “actions do not affect the interests of the United Kingdom and are not aimed at undermining its security”.\n\n“We are not interested in British underwater communications,” it said, urging Britain to “refrain from destructive steps that exacerbate the crisis phenomena on the European continent”.\n\nThe Yantar, which is designed to conduct surveillance in peacetime and sabotage during times of war, according to British officials, also  investigated the UK’s defences in January  as it sailed through the English Channel.\n\nThe royal navy dispatched two vessels to monitor the spy vessel, which Healey said was “loitering over UK critical undersea infrastructure” before it departed for the Mediterranean.\n\nKremlin-linked vessels, part of Russia’s so-called shadow fleet of sanctions-evading oil tankers, have been accused of carrying out attacks on pipelines and cables as a new form of underwater hybrid warfare.\n\nIn December, Finnish authorities  seized a Russia-linked ship  on suspicion that it intentionally damaged an undersea power cable in the Baltic Sea between Finland and Estonia.\n\nHealey’s warning also came as he made the case for increased defence spending in the face of threats from Russia, China and Iran before the unveiling of Britain’s new budget on November 26.\n\nIn June, Britain pledged to  increase defence spending to 5 percent  of its gross domestic product by 2035, more than double last year’s 2.3 percent and in line with most other NATO nations.\n\nAs part of that, Healey said the UK plans to develop “13 potential sites” to manufacture munitions and explosives as part of a 1.5-billion-pound (about $1.95bn) investment plan to create more than 1,000 jobs.\n\n“This is a new era of threat. It demands a new era for defence, an era of hard power, strong allies and of sure diplomacy,’’ Healey said. “And as the threat grows, Britain must step up, and we are.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful G4 geomagnetic storm, resulting from multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the sun, is expected to impact Earth between November 9 and 14, 2025.

triggering northern lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/whats-behind-a-surge-in-bear-attacks-in-japan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:32:02Z","title":"What’s behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan is facing a severe surge in bear attacks since April 2025, with at least 13 deaths and over 100 injuries, the highest number since 2006.

surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/20/turkiye-to-host-cop31-climate-summit-after-australia-concedes-bid","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:26:36+00:00","title":"Turkiye to host COP31 climate summit after Australia concedes bid","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Turkiye has been awarded the hosting rights for the 2026 COP31 climate summit in Antalya, following a prolonged dispute with Australia, which had sought to host a regional 'Pacific COP' with South Pacific nations.

Australia over the location of the top United Nations climate meeting.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Thursday morning that Australia had reached an arrangement with Turkiye to host negotiations in the lead-up to the 2026 UN climate meeting along with Pacific nations while Turkiye will assume the presidency of the official meeting.\n\n“What we’ve come up with is a big win for both Australia and [Turkiye],” Albanese told the Australian public broadcaster ABC Radio Perth.\n\nThe announcement comes as  this year’s COP30 climate summit  in the Brazilian city of Belem is due to close on Friday.\n\nAustralia had been pushing to host COP31 next year as a “Pacific COP” alongside low-lying South Pacific nations, which are increasingly threatened by rising seas and climate-fuelled disasters.\n\nDespite Australia’s efforts, Turkiye refused to back down in its bid to host the summit.\n\nTurkiye had said that as an emerging economy, it would promote solidarity between rich and poor countries at its summit, which would have a more global rather than regional focus.\n\nTurkiye will now have just 12 months to plan the meeting at the Antalya Expo Center due to the unusually long process to secure hosting duties and the lack of procedures in place to handle a situation in which two countries wanted to host at the same time.\n\nThe presidency of the  Conference of the Parties (COP)  to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change traditionally rotates among five regions: Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe, and Western Europe and others.\n\nAustralia and Turkiye both fit within the latter category of Western Europe and others, meaning that Australia will now have to wait another five years until it can bid to host the meeting again.\n\nEthiopian Minister for Planning and Development Fitsum Assefa Adela announced last week that her country had already secured the support of African negotiators to host COP32 in 2027.\n\nPapua New Guinea (PNG) quickly voiced frustration with Australia for dropping its bid to cohost the COP with its Pacific island neighbours.\n\n“We are all not happy and disappointed it’s ended up like this,” PNG Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko told the AFP news agency.\n\n“What has COP achieved over the years? Nothing,” Tkatchenko said. “It’s just a talk fest and doesn’t hold the big polluters accountable.”\n\nAustralian Senator Steph Hodgins-May from the Australian Greens party said Australia’s withdrawal from hosting the meeting reflected the current Labor government’s “continued coal and gas approvals” as Australia continues to increase its exports of  fossil fuels .\n\n“This is extremely disappointing, but it shows that the world recognises Australia’s significant role in making dangerous climate change worse,” May said.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, both Australia and Turkiye are heavily dependent on coal, oil and gas for energy, but both countries have also been making progress in renewable energy.\n\nAustralia’s federal Labor government had hoped to showcase renewable energy progress in the state of South Australia by hosting the conference in the state’s capital, Adelaide.\n\nHowever, the proposal was complicated by the city’s struggle to cope with a significant toxic algal bloom that has been taking place offshore for eight months.\n\nAlgal blooms are one of many complications caused by warming oceans, an aspect of climate change that climate scientists and other experts said can be improved only by rapidly reducing dependence on fossil fuels."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1911-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:11:11.191-11:19","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights key developments in science and technology, including strong demand for AI chips, a global trend of digital regulation (such as Australia’s plan to restrict children’s access to social media), and the role of major tech firms like Nvidia and OpenAI in shaping AI innovation.

under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26Z","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix structure with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, has died at the age of 97.

James Watson, whose research on the structure of DNA helped pave the way for developments in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who

Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science.

2025-11-03T12:27:39+00:00\n\nTitle: How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/at-least-2-dead-21-missing-in-landslides-in-indonesias-java-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:54:13+00:00","title":"At least 2 dead, 21 missing in landslides in Indonesia’s Java island","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent landslide event on Java Island, Indonesia, at least two people were killed and 21 remain missing after heavy rainfall affected three villages in the Cilacap district.

ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/landslides-kill-dozens-as-heavy-rains-lash-southeast-asia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:47:57+00:00","title":"Landslides kill dozens as heavy rains lash Southeast Asia","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dozens of people have been killed across Southeast Asia due to landslides triggered by heavy rains during the rainy season.

scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2y40lj5go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"03:47:54.384+00:00","title":"Trump signs bill ordering release of Jeffrey Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill requiring the U.S. Justice Department to release all unclassified files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation within 30 days, including victim interviews, flight logs, and internal communications.

2025-11-20T03:47:54.384+00:00\n\nTitle: Trump signs bill ordering release of Jeffrey Epstein files\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he signed a bill ordering the release of all files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe bill requires the justice department to release all information from its Epstein investigation \"in a searchable and downloadable format\" within 30 days.\n\nTrump previously opposed releasing the files, but he changed course last week after facing pushback from Epstein's victims and members of his own Republican Party.\n\nWith his support, the legislation overwhelmingly cleared both chambers of Congress, the House of Representatives and Senate, on Tuesday.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, the president accused Democrats of championing the issue to distract attention from the achievements of his administration.\n\n\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.\n\nAlthough a congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own - lawmakers in the House passed the legislation with a 427-1 vote. The Senate gave unanimous consent to pass it upon its arrival, sending the bill to Trump for his signature.\n\nThe Epstein files subject to release under the legislation are documents from criminal investigations into the financier, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items seized in raids of his properties. Those materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs, and people and entities connected to Epstein.\n\nThe files are different from the more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate released by Congress last week, including some that directly mention Trump.\n\nThose include 2018 messages from Epstein in which he said of Trump: \"I am the one able to take him down\" and \"I know how dirty donald is\".\n\nTrump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday night, Trump said Republicans had \"nothing to do with Epstein\".\n\n\"It's really a Democrat problem,\" he said. \"The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.\"\n\nEpstein was found dead in 2019 in his New York prison cell in what a coroner ruled was a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking. He had been convicted previously of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.\n\nThe once high-flying financier had ties with a number of high-profile figures, including Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the brother of King Charles and former prince; Trump; Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon; and a cast of other characters from the world of media, politics and entertainment.\n\nOn Wednesday, former Harvard president  Larry Summers took a leave  from teaching at the university while the school investigated his links to Epstein, revealed in a series of chummy email exchanges.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is required to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" related to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell no later than 30 days after the law is enacted. Maxwell currently is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nBut based on the law's text, portions could still be withheld if they are deemed to invade personal privacy or relate to an active investigation.\n\nThe bill gives Bondi the power to withhold information that would jeopardise any active federal investigation or identify any victims.\n\nOne of the bill's architects, Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, said he had concerns about some files being withheld.\n\n\"I'm concerned that [Trump is] opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" he said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwgd0rjdzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"22:42:05.591+00:00","title":"Nord Stream: Italy to extradite pipeline blast suspect to Germany","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Italy’s top appeals court has ordered the extradition of Serhiy Kuznetsov, a former Ukrainian military officer, to Germany to face charges of anti-constitutional sabotage related to the 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines.

He is due to be removed from Italy under German police escort in the next few days.\n\nProsecutors believe Mr Kuznetsov coordinated and led a group that planted explosives on the pipes deep beneath the Baltic Sea in 2022, though they have not disclosed any evidence.\n\nThe case has serious implications for relations between Ukraine and Germany, which is the biggest source of military aid for Kyiv in Europe.\n\nMr Kuznetsov's lawyer said his client \"feels like a scapegoat\" and is \"very sad\" that his government has not spoken out in his defence, or even confirmed that he was a serving soldier at the time of the blasts.\n\n\"If he carried out the attack, then he did so because he was ordered to do so because he was for sure a captain of the Ukrainian army,\" Nicola Canestrini said after Wednesday's hearing.\n\nThe BBC has seen a copy of Mr Kuznetsov's military ID among the court papers. He has not commented publicly on whether he was involved in the explosions.\n\n\"The Ukrainian government knows exactly where he was every day of September 2022,\" his lawyer said. \"So, if he's innocent, why don't they say it? If he did it, why don't they say it? That's his question.\"\n\nThe BBC has approached government and security sources in Kyiv, but they have not commented.\n\nMr Kuznetsov was arrested in northern Italy in late August, at a glamping site near the city of Rimini where he had booked in for a few nights with his wife and two of their children.\n\nHis passport details were entered online at check-in, and in Italy that information is automatically transferred to the carabinieri, the local police.\n\nLater that night, officers came knocking at the family's door.\n\nA month later, a second Ukrainian suspect was detained at his home close to Poland's capital Warsaw on another arrest warrant issued by Germany.\n\nVolodymyr Zhuravlyov, an amateur deep-sea diver, has lived in Poland with his family since just before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nHe was held in custody for 17 days, but a court then refused to extradite him.\n\nThe judge delivered a passionate speech, arguing that no Ukrainian could be prosecuted for what he characterised as a legitimate act of self-defence against Russia's \"bloody and genocidal\" invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn Italy, further from Ukraine, the mood and the politics are very different.\n\nMr Canestrini described the Italian appeal court's ruling as a \"great disappointment\", but said the fight for his client would now move to Germany - with the aim of having Mr Kuznetsov acquitted on the same grounds.\n\nMany Ukrainians consider whoever did destroy Nord Stream to be heroes for taking out an important revenue source for Russia, and struggle to understand why Germany - a key ally of Ukraine - is pursuing this prosecution.\n\nOn Wednesday, one man stood outside the palatial courthouse in Rome wrapped in a Ukrainian flag and holding a poster that read: \"Serhiy Kuznetsov is a defender, not a criminal.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdgrqwnq9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:32:13.582+00:00","title":"Top US officials in Ukraine for talks on ending war with Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senior US military officials, led by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, have arrived in Kyiv for high-level talks with Ukrainian leaders to discuss ending the war with Russia.

justice has claimed he was beaten by police officers and \"bullied\" into falsely admitting murder, in his first interview since his release.\n\nPeter Sullivan told the BBC he believes he was \"stitched up\" in 1986 over the killing of Diane Sindall, who was ambushed and beaten to death during a frenzied sexual attack in Birkenhead, Wirral.\n\nMr Sullivan, who has learning difficulties, had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in May after new DNA tests were carried out.\n\nHe now wants an apology from Merseyside Police. The force said while it \"regretted\" that a \"grave miscarriage of justice\" had taken place, it maintained its officers acted within the law at the time.\n\nEarlier the force said it  had referred itself to watchdog  the Independent Office for Police Conduct for a second time based on Mr Sullivan's comments - having initially done so in May after the appeal decision.\n\nSpeaking from an undisclosed location with his face hidden to protect his privacy, Mr Sullivan, 68, said he wanted an explanation for why detectives \"picked me out\".\n\n\"I can't forgive them for what they've done to me, because it's going to be there for the rest of my life,\" he said, adding he had \"lost everything\" since going to prison.\n\n\"I've got to carry that burden until I can get an apology.\"\n\nFor decades Mr Sullivan and his family were haunted by tabloid press nicknames, including \"The Beast of Birkenhead\", \"The Mersey Ripper\", and \"The Wolfman\".\n\n\"The names, they'll always stick with me because I've never been anything like that,\" he said.\n\nMr Sullivan said despite moments of near hopelessness, he was always supported by his parents who died years before he could clear his name.\n\nHe said: \"My mum turned around to me before she died, and said, 'I want you to carry on fighting this case because you've done nothing wrong'.\"\n\nIn one of many painful moments from his time behind bars, Mr Sullivan said he was denied permission to attend his mother's funeral in 2013 because she was buried in the same cemetery as Miss Sindall.\n\nHis ordeal began after the semi-naked body of 21-year-old florist Miss Sindall was found with catastrophic injuries in an alley off Borough Road, Birkenhead, on 2 August 1986.\n\nTwo weeks later, her partially burned clothing was found on Bidston Hill, a large area of woodland about an hour's walk from the alley.\n\nAfter a BBC Crimewatch appeal was aired, witnesses came forward claiming to have seen Mr Sullivan in a pub near the murder scene that night, while others reported seeing a man fitting his description near Bidston Hill the following day.\n\nHe was arrested on suspicion of murder on 23 September 1986, and was interviewed 22 times over the following four weeks.\n\nFor the first seven police interviews, he was denied legal advice and found the experience \"very daunting\".\n\n\"They were putting stuff into my mind, then they would send me back to my cell, then I'd come back and say what they wanted, not realising what I was doing at the time,\" he said.\n\nDuring that period Mr Sullivan claimed he was beaten in his cell on two occasions by police officers.\n\n\"They threw a blanket over the top of me and they were hitting me on top of the blanket with the truncheons to try and get me to co-operate with them,\" he said.\n\n\"It really hurt, they were leathering me.\"\n\nMr Sullivan also claimed he was told if he did not confess he would be charged with \"35 other rapes\", and said he was denied food and sleep.\n\nHe was not provided with an appropriate adult to help him understand the interrogation, despite police custody records noting he had learning difficulties.\n\nAsked why he would confess to a murder he did not commit, Mr Sullivan said: \"All I can say, it was the bullying that forced me to throw my hands in, because I couldn't take it anymore.\"\n\nAppeal court documents confirm that the first time he \"confessed\" was not recorded and no solicitor was present. Other police interviews were recorded.\n\nIn a statement for this article, Merseyside Police said it was previously unaware of the allegations about beatings or threats to charge him with other offences, and said records from the time did not contain details of this. It said guidance on appropriate adults had been strengthened since 1986.\n\nThe force accepted that legal advice was initially refused for interviews, adding that officers had feared revealing some parts of the investigation to a solicitor, in case evidence was destroyed. It also said Mr Sullivan was told he did not have to speak to officers unless he wished to do so.\n\nSarah Myatt, Mr Sullivan's solicitor of more than 20 years, sat alongside him as he spoke to the BBC. \"I think, from what he's told me, he just reached breaking point with it,\" she said.\n\nMr Sullivan said during one interview he was asked to mark on a map where he had left the clothes on Bidston Hill.\n\nWhen he pointed to the wrong place, he alleges a detective replied: \"Come on Peter, you know better than that,\" before hinting at the \"correct\" location.\n\nMs Myatt said on the maps of Bidston Hill, Mr Sullivan had later written \"this is all lies\".\n\n\"I think that's quite poignant,\" she said.\n\nMerseyside Police said the maps and transcripts, which the BBC has not seen, were all served on the courts. The force said interviewing officers had been \"trying to understand the validity of his admissions\".\n\nWhile Mr Sullivan later retracted his confessions, the police and prosecution also relied on bite mark evidence, a now widely discredited field of forensic science.\n\nThat case, brought before DNA testing was widely available, was enough to convince a jury at Liverpool Crown Court - and on 5 November 1987 he went from a self-confessed \"petty thief\" to a convicted murderer.\n\nRecalling the guilty verdicts, Mr Sullivan said: \"My sister collapsed in the courtroom and the next minute, that was it.\n\n\"I was taken down from the courtroom and I just sat in that cell and cried my eyes out over the crime I hadn't done.\n\n\"I knew from then on that this is going to be one hell of a case to try and fight to try and get myself out of this situation.\"\n\nHis sentence carried a minimum term of 16 years before he was eligible to apply for parole - but Mr Sullivan maintained his innocence, lessening his chances of release.\n\nPrison was particularly difficult for someone considered a savage killer and a sex offender. \"I've been battered in prisons because of the crime I was in for,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he said reporting such violence was not an option because \"then you're a grass, and that means then you're going to get a lot worse\".\n\nThe end of his nightmare began in 2023, when the Criminal Cases Review Commission - the body set up to check for miscarriages of justice - ordered fresh testing of semen samples found on Miss Sindall's body in 1986.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to challenge the DNA results ahead of a fresh appeal - paving the way for Mr Sullivan's freedom.\n\nIn May 2025, when the appeal judgement was handed down, Mr Sullivan was listening via video-link from HMP Wakefield, sitting next to his probation officer.\n\n\"When they came back in with the verdict that my case had been quashed, [the probation officer] burst into tears first,\" he said.\n\n\"She turned around and said, 'Peter, you're going home'...\n\n\"Next minute, bang, all the tears started running down my face and that was it, I went, 'yes, justice has been done'.\"\n\nThe outside world has been a baffling place for a man who went into custody when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and the internet was unheard of.\n\nSpeaking of the moment he was driven out of prison, he said: \"I was watching the cars go by, and I've never seen so many different cars in my life on that road.\n\n\"It was daunting just seeing them all changed and everything.\"\n\nSince his release, he has sometimes found himself standing in his bedroom waiting for a prison officer to do a roll-call - a difficult habit to shake after nearly 40 years.\n\nMr Sullivan said he feels \"really sorry\" for the family of Miss Sindall, who he said are \"back at square one\" in their fight for justice.\n\n\"I've been through the same pain, being in prison, because I've been taken away from my family as well for something I haven't done,\" he said.\n\nMerseyside Police said due to the \"substantial changes\" in the law and investigative practices since 1986, there would be \"little benefit\" in any formal review of how the case was investigated.\n\nIt said \"no misconduct was identified\" at the time of the first IOPC referral in May, but confirmed it would ask the body to look again after Mr Sullivan's interview.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service said while the Court of Appeal accepted the new DNA testing, other grounds of appeal were rejected. Nick Price, its director of legal services, said: \"The prosecution case was brought on the basis of all the evidence available to us at the time.\"\n\nThe case of Miss Sindall's murder has been re-opened, although no arrests have been made.\n\nFor Mr Sullivan, there remains the wait for compensation, capped by the government at £1.3m for wrongful convictions.\n\nMs Myatt, who is helping him with his application, said: \"There's not a figure that you could say would be enough for losing 38 years of your life.\"\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on  BBC Sounds  and follow BBC Merseyside on  Facebook ,  X , and  Instagram , and watch BBC North West Tonight on  BBC iPlayer ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8v8gmzd9yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:49:34.957+00:00","title":"Ryan Wedding: Olympic snowboarder-turned-drug kingpin charged with murder, say US officials","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ryan Wedding, a former Olympic snowboarder from Canada, is now accused of leading a transnational drug cartel that orchestrated the murder of a federal witness by posting his photos on a fake news website.

who is now allegedly running a drug cartel orchestrated the killing of a federal witness by releasing his image to a fake news website, the US justice department has said.\n\nAuthorities raised the reward for information leading to the arrest of Ryan Wedding from $10m (£7.6m) to $15m, calling him a modern-day Pablo Escobar, referring to the Colombian drug lord.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel said Mr Wedding, 44, was \"responsible for engineering a narco trafficking and narco terrorism programme that we have not seen in a long time\".\n\nThe US officials said they believe the Canadian, one of the FBI's 10 most wanted, is living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi alleged that Mr Wedding was behind the murder of a federal witness in a case against him.\n\nHe allegedly placed a bounty by paying C$10,000 ($7,000; £5,400) to have photos of the witness and his wife posted to a Canada-based website, The Dirty Newz, in October 2024 to help locate him.  The website  has since been removed by the FBI.\n\nThe witness was shot and killed in a restaurant in Medellin, Colombia, in January.\n\nBondi said Mr Wedding had also been charged with witness tampering and intimidation, murder, money laundering and drug trafficking.\n\nThe FBI is still seeking unknown suspects directly involved in the murder, including the killer and someone who helped them escape.\n\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, US and Canadian law enforcement officials announced a series of other developments in a case against Mr Wedding, including a new indictment and 10 arrests.\n\nOfficials said Mr Wedding's organisation operated across North America and other countries and was the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada. It is estimated the cartel brings in more than $1bn a year.\n\nRCMP Commissioner Michael Duheme said seven Canadians allegedly linked to the cartel were arrested on Tuesday in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario and Alberta, and would be extradited to the US.\n\nThey have been charged with offences including conspiracy to commit murder and drug trafficking.\n\nAmong them is Deepak Balwant Paradkar, a Canadian lawyer who is accused of providing \"a range of illegal services to Wedding and his drug trafficking organization beyond the scope of a normal attorney-client relationship\", the US treasury department said in a release.\n\nThey allege Mr Paradkar was paid with \"luxury watches and additional fees for these illegal services\".\n\nAccording to the new unsealed indictment, Mr Paradkar advised Mr Wedding and his  close accomplice to murder the federal witness in order to avoid extradition from Mexico on criminal charge.\n\nThe BBC has attempted to contact Mr Paradkar through his office for comment.\n\nThe alleged co-founder of The Dirty Newz, Gursewak Singh Bal, 31, was among those arrested this week.\n\nAn eighth person in Canada is still being sought by authorities.\n\nAlso detained this week was Carmen Yelinet Valoyes Florez, 47 - a Colombian national who officials allege runs a high-end prostitution ring in Mexico and helped the cartel find the federal witness - and Atna Ohna, 40, of Quebec. He is accused of hiring a hitman for the cartel, later receiving a \"bejewelled necklace\" for his role in the witness's death.\n\nMr Wedding competed in Giant Slalom snowboarding for Canada during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.\n\nHis aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\", the FBI has said.\n\nOfficials allege the former Olympian launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution\n\nThe FBI alleges that he has ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx242yj380no","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"01:24:31.319+00:00","title":"Turkey set to host COP31 after reaching compromise with Australia","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A compromise has been reached between Australia and Turkey to host the COP31 climate summit in 2026, with the main event taking place in Antalya, Turkey, and a pre-COP meeting scheduled on a Pacific island.

in 2026 falls to a group of countries made up of Western Europe, Australia and others.\n\nA consensus must be reached but neither country had been willing to concede. Australia has now agreed to support the Turkish bid in return for their minister chairing the talks following negotiations at COP30, currently being held in Brazil.\n\nThis unusual arrangement has taken observers by surprise. It is normal for a COP president to be from the host country and how this new partnership will work in practice remains to be seen.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called the compromise with Turkey an \"outstanding result\" in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), noting Pacific issues would be \"front and centre\".\n\nHe added that he had spoken to Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape and Prime Minister Rabuka of Fiji.\n\nHowever, Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko told the AFP news agency \"we are all not happy. And disappointed it's ended up like this\".\n\nSolomon Islands leader Jeremiah Manele earlier told the ABC he would be \"disappointed\" if Australia didn't secure the event.\n\nDespite this, there will be relief among countries currently meeting at COP30 in the Brazilian city of Belém that a compromise has been reached as the lack of agreement on the venue was becoming an embarrassment for the UN.\n\nAustralia has pushed hard to have the climate summit in the city of Adelaide, arguing that they would co-host the meeting with Pacific island states who are seen as among the most vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels.\n\nTurkey, which has proposed hosting COP31 in the city of Antalya, felt that they had a good claim to be the host country as they had stood aside in 2021 and allowed the UK to hold the meeting in Glasgow.\n\nIf neither country was willing to compromise then the meeting would have been held in the German city of Bonn, the headquarters of the UN's climate body.\n\nAs a result of discussions at COP30, a compromise appears to have been reached.\n\nThis includes pre-COP meeting will be held on a Pacific island, while the main event is held in Turkey. Australia's climate minister Chris Bowen will be its president.\n\n\"Obviously, it would be great if Australia could have it all, but we can't have it all,\" Mr Bowen told reporters outside the Australian delegation offices here in Belém.\n\n\"This process works on consensus, and consensus means if someone objected to our bid, it would go to Bonn.\"\n\n\"That would mean 12 months with a lack of leadership, no COP president in place, no plan, that would be irresponsible for multilateralism in this challenging environment.\"\n\nMr Bowen believes having a COP president not from the host country will work and that he will have the considerable authority reserved for the president of these gatherings.\n\n\"As COP president of negotiations, I would have all the powers of the COP presidency to manage, to handle the negotiations, to appoint co-facilitators, to prepare draft text, to issue the cover decision,\" he said.\n\nHe also confirmed to the BBC that Turkey will also appoint a president who will run the venue, organise the meetings and schedules.\n\nAustralia's climbdown will be embarrassing for the government of Mr Albanese, after lobbying long and hard to win support among the other nations in the Western Europe group.\n\nThe compromise will have to be ratified by more than 190 countries gathered here for COP30.\n\nGiven the difficulties in getting to this compromise, there are unlikely to be any objections."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvynlxqdyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"13:52:41.501+00:00","title":"The Silicon Valley 'AI factory' at the heart of the tech race","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) in the tech sector, focusing on Google’s development of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) as a key technological edge.

Googleplex, its California headquarters. A walkway runs along the length of it, passing by a giant dinosaur skeleton, a beach volleyball pitch and dozens of Googlers lunching under the hazy November sun.\n\nBut it's a laboratory, hidden away at the back of the campus behind some trees, that he is most excited to show me.\n\nThis is where the invention that Google believes is its secret weapon is being developed.\n\nKnown as a Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU), it looks like an unassuming little chip but, says Mr Pichai, it will one day power every AI query that goes through Google. This makes it potentially one of the most important objects in the world economy right now.\n\n\"AI is the most profound technology humanity [has ever worked] on,\" he insists. \"It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions.\"\n\nBut the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all.\n\nThe Bank of England has already warned of a \"sudden correction\" in global financial markets, saying \"market valuations appear stretched\" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that \"there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now\".\n\nAsked whether  Google would be immune  from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: \"I think no company is going to be immune, including us.\"\n\nSo why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed?\n\nThe AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen.\n\nIts numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another.\n\nChipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn.\n\nThe purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough.\n\nThe value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US.\n\nYet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500.\n\nAnd that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF.\n\nMr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these \"inflection points\": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. \"Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence.\"\n\nBut as for the big question - is it a bubble?\n\nMr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is \"palpably exciting\" progress of services that people and companies are using.\n\nBut he concedes: \"It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry…\n\n\"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\"\n\nNow, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and  complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets.\n\nWhich brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs.\n\nThe lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: \"restricted\".\n\nWhat's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations.\n\nThe TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips.\n\nThe CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI.\n\nHowever Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic.\n\nA core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software).\n\nNvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term \"AI factories\" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems.\n\n(Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.)\n\nStories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them.\n\nAs Mr Ellison put it: \"I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!\"\n\nIt is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending.\n\nThe terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms.\n\nThere are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia.\n\nJust before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded.\n\nThe firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing.\n\nFew in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this.\n\nIn a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: \"If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough.\"\n\nHe has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology.\n\n\"I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies,\" he said.\n\nBut he also said: \"What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure.\"\n\nElsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month.\n\nPlus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days.\n\nNone of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share.\n\nWhat we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai.\n\n\"I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true,\" he told me. \"Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it.\"\n\nBut I put it to him that truth matters. His response: \"truth matters\".\n\nNor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it?\n\nBy 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets.\n\nI put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower?\n\n\"I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure.\n\n\"You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy,\" he adds. \"I think that will have consequences.\"\n\nYears ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about \"irrational exuberance\".\n\nIn that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com.\n\nThrough it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all.\n\nTake Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion.\n\nThe same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst.\n\nPlus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless.\n\nThat is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nThis is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence.\n\nBut I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage.\n\nAnd while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale.\n\nFor now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm.\n\nOthers will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Epstein saga reveals Republican rifts - and power of Trump's base\n\nAfter Congress voted to force the justice department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein, the legislation will now move to President Donald Trump's desk.\n\nAnd if Trump does sign it into law as expected, it will mark the final action in what has been a remarkable and abrupt change in his position.\n\nFor months, Trump was dismissive of calls to release the government's full trove of documents about the late financier and convicted sex offender. He described the case in July as \"pretty boring stuff\".\n\nThat was until Sunday, when - with a snowballing number of Republicans in the House signalling they would vote to release them - the president relented and encouraged them to do so. His shift opened the floodgates for an overwhelming 427-1 vote on Tuesday.\n\nHis reversal was a rare instance of Republican politicians pressuring Trump into action, and into a very public change in stance, rather than the other way around.\n\nRegardless of what new information any future files may contain, the saga exposed fractures within the Republican Party and highlighted the power of Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) base.\n\nIt also has shown that, despite his best efforts, he may have struggled to move attention away from the Epstein files if he had not backed the vote.\n\n\"I think he sees that this is an issue he's underwater in with average Republicans,\" said Martha Zoller, a conservative radio host and Republican strategist in Georgia.\n\n\"I think Trump had to do this in this point in time because he wants to be back on the right side,\" she added.\n\nA NPR/PBS News/Marist poll taken at the end of September - when Trump was yet to back the release of the files - suggested that 67% of Republican registered voters supported the release of all Epstein files with victims' names redacted. Another 18% supported releasing some of the files with similar redactions.\n\n\"Transparency on what happened is extremely important to the voters,\" Chris Ager, the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party, told the BBC.\n\nHe praised Trump's reversal, arguing it was the sign of a healthy party \"that you can have a disagreement on an issue... and come to a conclusion where essentially everyone is agreeing: Let's release the files\".\n\nFor much of this year, however, there were sharp disagreements on the issue. Trump's reversal came as it looked increasingly likely he could face a revolt in the House.\n\nThe most notable defector, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, said at a press conference with Epstein survivors on Tuesday that the saga had \"ripped Maga apart\".\n\nDue to her vocal opposition, Trump dubbed her a \"traitor\" on Truth Social. Typically, such a public attack from the president would quiet dissent from a Republican, especially one up for re-election. But in a sign of the political potency of the Epstein issue, Greene pushed back.\n\n\"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off this discharge petition,\" Greene said on Tuesday.\n\nThe House would advance the legislation, Greene said, \"because the American people who we serve as representatives here in Congress demanded this vote happen\".\n\nGreene, who first broke with Trump in the spring, has been the public face of building dissent within Trump's Maga movement - not just on Epstein, but on other issues such as the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites in June and the president's continuing focus on foreign wars.\n\nBut on the Epstein issue in particular, Greene and others in the movement have called for greater transparency despite Trump's desire to focus on other issues. And after Tuesday's votes in Congress, they can claim real success.\n\n\"The saga reveals how much power the Republican base now wields,\" party strategist Rina Shah told NPR in the summer. \"MAGA voters are furious.\"\n\n\"This pressure is forcing even the most loyal Trump allies to break ranks. And it signals a Republican Party that's increasingly populist, where the grassroots can push leaders to act or they have to pay a price.\"\n\nThe Epstein vote has also overshadowed other White House initiatives. Last week,  President Trump announced he would roll back tariffs on groceries  like coffee, bananas and beef as Americans' cost of living concerns increased.\n\n\"I think he'd rather people talk about those things than Epstein,\" Zoller, the Republican strategist in Georgia, said.\n\nOne senior Trump administration official told Axios  that the president decided to drop his opposition to the legislation because the noise around the Epstein issue was proving to be a \"major distraction\".\n\nGreene herself has said the White House was going down the wrong track by resisting the release of more Epstein files, instead of focusing on other issues.\n\n\"It's insanely the wrong direction to go,\" Greene  told POLITICO . \"The five-alarm fire is healthcare and affordability for Americans. And that's where the focus should be.\"\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, said in a statement to the BBC that \"by releasing thousands of pages of documents, co-operating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\"\n\nEven beyond Epstein, Trump's influence on the party has been tested - and even rebuffed this week. And there are signs of potential rifts, too.\n\nHis public efforts to encourage Indiana's leaders to redraw their congressional maps to favour Republicans before the 2026 midterm elections hit a potentially critical roadblock on the same day as the Epstein vote.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Indiana Senate voted on Tuesday to adjourn until January, signalling it would not take up the issue of redistricting. That is despite major pressure from the president as well as the state's Republican governor who has asked lawmakers to work on redrawing maps.\n\nTrump has even threatened to back primary challenges to senators who oppose redistricting. But as with the Epstein issue, there has been defiance within the party.\n\n\"I've been a legislator 42 years. I'm not going to change my vote,\" Republican Senator Vaneta Becker told CNN.\n\nReferring to the nickname for people from Indiana, she said: \"Hoosiers are not used to being sort of in a blackmail position. It does not bode well.\"\n\nBut as those close to Trump have noted, he has navigated fallouts and internal opposition in the past. Despite this defiance on several fronts, the president remains the most powerful figure in the party.\n\n\"I think the president is going to be praised for the fact that the information gets released and is out. At the end of the day, it's results, not the sausage making that got us there,\" said Mr Ager, referring to the Epstein files.\n\nTrump said as much himself in a Truth Social posted Tuesday night, remarking that he did not care when Senate Republicans passed the bill. “I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce868dmz2mdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"02:44:38.735+00:00","title":"Ex-Harvard president Larry Summers stops teaching while university investigates Epstein emails","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, former Harvard president and US Treasury Secretary, has stepped back from teaching and public roles after being linked through emails to Jeffrey Epstein, a sex offender arrested in 2019.

investigates Epstein emails \n\nHarvard University professor Larry Summers is taking leave while the school investigates his and others' ties with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\nThe former US treasury secretary and onetime Harvard president will stop teaching and step back as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nA spokesperson told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that Summers believes \"it's in the best interest of the Center\".\n\nRecently released emails indicate that Summers corresponded with Epstein until the day before the financier's 2019 arrest for the alleged sex trafficking of minors.\n\nIn a statement to The Harvard Crimson, the university said it was \"conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents\".\n\nThe BBC has contacted Summers for comment on Harvard's new review.\n\nOn Tuesday, Summers addressed his communication with Epstein to students in a class he had been teaching at Harvard.\n\n\"Some of you will have seen my statement of regret, expressing my shame with respect to what I did in communication with Mr. Epstein. And that I've said that I'm going to step back from public activity,\" Summers told his students, according to a video recorded by a student.\n\n\"I think it's very important to fulfill my teaching obligations. So with your permission, we're going to go forward and talk about the material in the class.\"\n\nBut on Wednesday night, Summers spokesperson Steven Goldberg said in the statement provided to CBS that \"co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester\".\n\nThe public fallout for Summers began after Congress released over 20,000 pages of documents from the so-called Epstein files last week, which included multiple emails between Epstein and Summers.\n\nTime stamps from the emails showed the two communicated up until the day before Epstein's arrest - a decade after he pleaded guilty for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.\n\nA married father of six, Summers messaged Epstein in November 2018 seemingly asking for romantic advice related to his interest in someone he said viewed him as an \"economics mentor\".\n\n\"Think for now I'm going nowhere with her except economics mentor,\" Summers wrote in one exchange where Epstein referred to himself as Summers' \"wing man\".\n\n\"Am I thanking her or being sorry re my being married. I think the former,\" he wrote in another email.\n\nThe emails also indicated that Summers and Epstein dined together frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures.\n\nNo Epstein survivor has accused Summers of misconduct, and there is no publicly available evidence indicating that he was involved in any of Epstein's crimes.\n\nSummers announced earlier Wednesday that he was leaving the board of OpenAI, and the artificial intelligence company said it respected Summers' decision to resign.\n\n\"We appreciate his many contributions and the perspective he brought to the Board,\" OpenAI said.\n\nHe joined the board of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, in 2023 - following a failed attempt to oust its chief executive, Sam Altman.\n\nSummers said in a statement to the BBC about the move that he was \"grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress\".\n\nAfter the emails were shared with the public, Summers said he took \"full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein\".\n\nHe added that he wanted \"to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me\".\n\nSummers held senior posts under two Democratic presidents; serving as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, and as director of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama. He led Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and remains a professor there.\n\nThe Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, also has confirmed that Summers is no longer affiliated with the organisation.\n\nBoth chambers of Congress agreed on Tuesday to pass a measure to require the US justice department to release its files on Epstein, setting up the possible release of tens-of-thousands more documents.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the bill on Wednesday, after reversing his position on the issue following pushback from his supporters."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p8dpw1rwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"04:05:03.705+00:00","title":"Ethiopia's Amhara conflict: The forgotten war destroying women's lives","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on a severe and ongoing conflict in Ethiopia's Amhara region, beginning in August 2023, when the government attempted to disband regional militias like Fano, triggering a rebellion.

destroying women's lives\n\nWarning: This report contains descriptions of rape and sexual violence. Names of victims have been changed and identifying details omitted to protect their privacy and safety.\n\nEnat was at home with her eight-year-old niece when the soldiers came one Sunday morning, she says.\n\nThe Ethiopian army was carrying out searches of homes in the Amhara region on 5 January this year, as part of a crackdown on a growing rebellion launched by local militias known as Fano.\n\nEnat says three men, dressed in army uniform, entered her home in South Gondar and began asking questions about her family background and whether Fano fighters had visited the beer hall where she worked.\n\nEnat, 21, said they had.\n\n\"How could we lie? How can we hide the truth?\" Enat says, noting that Fano - an Amharic word loosely translated as volunteer fighters - is made up of locals.\n\nThings quickly escalated.\n\nAfter asking questions about her family background, Enat says the soldiers began insulting her, then threatened her niece with a gun when the little girl started crying.\n\nEnat says one of the soldiers then raped her in front of her niece while the others kept guard.\n\n\"I begged them not to hurt me. I called on the saints and begged them. But their hearts didn't pity me. They violated me.\"\n\nEnat, who is from the Amhara ethnic group, the second largest in Ethiopia, is among thousands of women believed to have been sexually assaulted and raped since the conflict between the Ethiopian army and Fano started in August 2023.\n\nSexual violence in the region is largely undocumented, but the BBC has collated data which shows there have been thousands of reports of rape between July 2023 and May 2025, with victims as young as eight and as old as 65.\n\nWhile restrictions have prevented independent media from entering Amhara to cover the conflict, the BBC team in Nairobi, in neighbouring Kenya, managed to speak to women and doctors in the region, offering a rare insight into the human impact of the crisis.\n\nThe conflict began when the government attempted to disband regional military groups, including those in Amhara, which had fought with the army during the 2020-2022 civil war in the next-door region of Tigray.\n\nFano militias felt betrayed by the move and believed it would leave them vulnerable to attack from Tigray and elsewhere, especially as violence against the Amhara community had intensified, according to rights groups.\n\nIn response, Fano launched a rebellion, seizing major towns. They claim to be fighting for regional autonomy and protecting their communities from marginalisation by the Ethiopian government.\n\nThe insurgency has resulted in a violent crackdown by the army, which calls Fano \"radical ethno-nationalists\".\n\nSince the conflict started, both sides have been accused of numerous human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, forced displacement, destruction of property, looting and widespread cases of sexual violence, including rape.\n\nRights groups, including Amnesty International, say there is evidence the army is disproportionately responsible for the abuses. They also say that Amhara people in other parts of Ethiopia have been deliberately targeted by the security forces and other armed groups.\n\nBefore she was attacked, Enat had never had sex and planned to one day marry at her local church in a ceremony conducted in accordance with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church's rites, just as other women in her family had done.\n\nSuch marriages are among the most revered traditions of the Amhara people, who are predominantly Orthodox Christian, but it requires couples to remain \"pure\" and not have any sexual contact until marriage.\n\n\"Before that day, I had never known a man,\" she says.\n\n\"It would have been better if they had killed me.\"\n\nTigist, 18, from West Gojjam, also in the Amhara region, worked in her family's small, traditional teahouse before she was attacked.\n\nShe describes how, in January 2024, a soldier who was a regular customer groped her. She says she rejected him - an act she believes led to the attack.\n\nLater that evening, as she was returning home from work, she says three soldiers, including the man who groped her, ambushed her in the street and gang-raped her on the pavement.\n\n\"My family found me unconscious on the roadside,\" she recalls. \"They carried me to the clinic, where I spent five days.\"\n\nSince the attack, Tigist says she's been unable to leave her house, paralysed by fear of men and the outside world.\n\n\"My fear keeps me from going to work... Whenever I see soldiers or any men I panic and hide myself away.\"\n\nShe ended up retreating from her life and breaking off her engagement. She says she never told her fiance why or what happened.\n\nOverwhelmed by despair, Tigist attempted to take her own life, but her family intervened just in time and saved her. She says that although she has contemplated suicide since then, she has promised her family she will not try to kill herself again.\n\nThe BBC collected data from 43 health facilities in Amhara - roughly 4% of all health facilities in the region - and other medical sources to get a snapshot of what has been happening.\n\nAt these facilities, there were 2,697 reports of rape between 18 July 2023 and May 2025. Children under 18 accounted for 45% of cases.\n\nJust over half of the victims tested positive for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), while many were also left pregnant and with severe psychological trauma.\n\nHowever, many victims of sexual violence never report the crime or seek treatment, fearful of stigma or of learning they may have contracted an STI or become pregnant.\n\nFor this reason, a senior health expert, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, says the victims who come to facilities in the Amhara region are only \"the tip of the iceberg\".\n\nLemlem is among those who have never reported their rape or sought medical treatment, terrified of learning that she might have a sexually transmitted infection, such as HIV.\n\nThe 23-year-old from South Gondar says government soldiers entered her house on 6 January to ask for information, a routine army practice.\n\nShe says when she didn't give them what they wanted, one of the soldiers raped her.\n\n\"He threatened me, saying: 'If you scream, one bullet is enough for you,'\" Lemlem says.\n\n\"I wept non-stop for a whole month. I couldn't eat. All I did was cry. I couldn't stand to walk. And I fell gravely ill.\"\n\nShe says the assault has driven her away from church, where she fears she may be the subject of gossip.\n\n\"It's repulsive to have been born a woman. If I were a man, they might have beaten me and walked away - they wouldn't have destroyed my life like this,\" says Lemlem, explaining how the trauma of the attack has made her feel about being female.\n\nMedics the BBC spoke to say there has been a sharp rise in the number of victims of sexual violence that they have been treating since the conflict began.\n\n\"They arrive trembling, too intimidated even to speak,\" one medic says.\n\nYet those who do come forward are reluctant to name their attackers and rarely seek justice, in part because the conflict has led to a breakdown in law and order.  Instead, most who do seek medical assistance come out of fear of pregnancy.\n\nOthers seek treatment long after they have been attacked, by which point certain medications for the STIs they have contracted, such as HIV, are no longer effective.\n\nHIV can often be prevented with a treatment called post-exposure prophylaxis, but only if it is administered soon after sex with someone who was infected.\n\nAnother medic notes that many victims say they are unable to access treatment promptly due to transport disruption and road blockages caused by the conflict.\n\nA senior medic warns they fear a public health and social crisis could be looming.\n\nBased on information health centres have gathered, they say that they \"have identified signs that HIV infections may rise and that mental health and psychological problems could reach catastrophic levels\", noting that some victims have attempted suicide.\n\nFigures from Ethiopia's health ministry in 2022 showed that the HIV rate in the region was around 1.1 per 100 people - higher than the national average.\n\nWhile assaults have been carried out by both sides in the conflict, medical staff report seeing more cases involving Ethiopian army soldiers than Fano militia. A government employee with access to relevant information, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, also said this was the case.\n\nMost incidents of rape were reported in urban areas where the army maintains bases and exerts control, however experts point out that people living in cities have better access to treatment so are more likely to get help and report attacks.\n\nThe BBC was unable to interview any victims of assaults by Fano fighters due to limited access to places where the militia are based.\n\nIn June 2024, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that the Ethiopian National Defence Force, which includes the army, had perpetrated sexual violence, including against minors, in the Amhara region during the conflict with Fano militia.\n\nThe BBC asked Ethiopia's ministry of defence to respond to allegations, but despite months of waiting, we have not received a reply.\n\nRepeated BBC requests for detailed information from regional authorities were also unsuccessful.\n\nA Fano leader, Asres Mare Damtie, told the BBC the group was unaware of any involvement by its fighters, saying no accusations had been made against them and it enforces severe punishment, including death, for offenders.\n\nThe BBC has learned that a government-commissioned investigation led by Ethiopia's Bahir Dar University into conflict-related sexual violence against women in Amhara has begun, with findings expected to be released publicly in the coming months.\n\nIn 2021, when the army and its allies - which then included Fano - faced similar allegations over their conduct in the Tigray conflict, the government condemned the use of rape but dismissed the claims as \"biased and flawed\".\n\nTo date, no official action has been publicly disclosed against perpetrators.\n\nAmnesty International has raised concerns over what it believes is a persistent pattern of impunity in Ethiopia's army. \"There is no meaningful effort to bring perpetrators into justice,\" says the organisation's regional researcher, Haimanot Ashenafi.\n\n\"They're still fighting, they are still out there with no consequences for what they've done… survivors who have gone through this life-changing experience deserve justice.\"\n\nFor Enat, the consequences of her attack have been far-reaching.\n\nA month after the assault, she fled her village to escape the trauma of the attack.\n\nIt was then she learned she was pregnant as a result of the rape.\n\n\"I started vomiting,\" she recalls.\n\nShe thought of having an abortion, which is legally permitted in Ethiopia up to 12 weeks into pregnancy if a woman is raped, but she was scared.\n\n\"I feared God, and I felt for my mother. What would become of her if I died during the abortion?\"\n\nShe gave birth to a daughter in early September after three days of labour.\n\nDespite what happened to her, Enat considers the baby a \"gift from God\".\n\nBut she is currently living with a relative and is unable to work as she has to look after her daughter. She worries for the future and how she will provide for her child and herself.\n\n\"If this is what is considered to be living, then yes, I am living,\" she adds.\n\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by the issues raised in this story, details of organisations offering information and support are available at  BBC ActionLine ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62e27j69q9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"18:45:35.626+00:00","title":"Israeli strikes in Gaza kill 25 Palestinians, health ministry says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a sharp escalation of violence, Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip killed at least 25 Palestinians, including civilians in the Zeitoun neighborhood and Khan Younis, in violation of a five-week ceasefire.

Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City was hit, according to rescuers.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had struck \"Hamas terrorist targets\" after it said gunmen had opened fire towards an area where its soldiers were operating in the southern city of Khan Younis, in violation of the five-week-old ceasefire agreement.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Hamas.\n\nThe flare-up of violence comes after the UN Security Council passed a resolution that endorsed US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan to end two years of devastating war.\n\nMahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, told the BBC that Israeli air, drone and artillery strikes hit several locations in Gaza City and Khan Younis shortly after sunset on Wednesday.\n\nThe attacks marked a sharp

at RAF pilots tracking it, says UK\n\nA Russian spy ship has used lasers for the first time to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its activity near UK waters, the defence secretary has said.\n\nJohn Healey told reporters the \"deeply dangerous\" move from the Yantar was being taken \"extremely seriously\" by the government.\n\nHe added that the vessel was north of Scotland and had entered UK waters for the second time this year during the last few weeks.\n\nThe UK would continue monitoring the ship and had \"military options ready should the Yantar change course,\" he added.\n\n\"My message to Russia and to Putin is this: we see you. We know what you're doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready,\" he added.\n\nHealey said the laser incident took place whilst the Yantar was being followed by a Royal Navy frigate and RAF Poseidon P-8 planes deployed to \"track the vessel's every move\". It is understood the episode occurred within the last two weeks.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Downing Street, the defence secretary added he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely \"when it is in our wider waters\".\n\nHealey said the vessel, which entered service in 2015, was part of Russia's Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI), which was designed to \"undertake surveillance in peacetime and sabotage in conflict\".\n\n\"We have military options ready should the Yantar change course. I am not going to reveal those because that only makes President Putin wiser,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the risks posed by lasers, Healey replied: \"Anything that impedes, disrupts or puts at risk pilots in charge of British military planes is deeply dangerous.\"\n\nThe Russian Embassy released a statement, saying it was \"not interested in British underwater communications\".\n\n\"The actions of our country do not touch interests of the UK and they are not aimed at undermining its security,\" the statement said.\n\nIt added: \"However, London, with its Russophobic path and increasing militaristic hysteria leads to further degradation European security, providing the premise for new dangerous situations.\n\n\"We call on the British side to hold off taking any destructive steps which might aggravate the crisis situation on the European continent.\"\n\nLabour MP Matt Western, who chairs the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, said: \"Today's news demonstrates once again that Russia presents a genuine and immediate threat to the UK's security.\"\n\nHe added: \"I welcome the seriousness with which the defence secretary is treating this issue, but there is more we can do. More assertive retaliation may be required.\"\n\nThe defence secretary previously  issued a warning  about the Yantar after it was spotted in UK waters in January, calling it \"another example of growing Russian aggression\".\n\nAccording to the ship tracking website Marine Traffic, the ship has not broadcast its location since 2 November, and was last tracked in the Baltic Sea north of the Latvian Coast.\n\nOn 6 November, the Dutch Navy said two of its vessels escorted the Yantar out of the North Sea, where it was operating near Dutch territorial waters.\n\nWhile the Yantar's current position is not clear, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 shows an RAF Poseidon P-8 surveillance plane circling off the Scottish coast, although it is not certain that this is tracking the Yantar.\n\nRussia describes Yantar, which is operated by the country's Ministry of Defence, as an oceanic research vessel. Western nations have often tracked it in European waters and they suspect part of its mission has been to map undersea cables.\n\nElisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an American security think tank, said the Yantar's use of lasers was \"an escalation for sure\".\n\n\"Essentially, you do it to impede the pilots from doing their work,\" she told BBC Radio 4's World At One.\n\n\"We don't know exactly how strong the lasers were, but even if they didn't blind the pilots, it was provocative,\" she added.\n\nThe UK and its Nato allies are  concerned about the risk Russia poses  to offshore cables, pipelines and other infrastructure critical to internet connectivity.\n\nIn his speech, the defence secretary warned about Russian incursions into Nato airspace, as well as the threats posed by China and armed conflicts around the world, adding: \"Our world is changing. It is less predictable. It is more dangerous.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Defence has come under  criticism from a committee of MPs  for being over-reliant on US defence resources and not being prepared to defend the UK and its overseas territories from military attack.\n\nThe committee said the UK and its European allies should be building up their capabilities to prepare for potential US withdrawal.\n\nHealey said the UK government \"takes a different view\" to the committee about America's commitment to Nato.\n\nBut he said the committee was \"right to say\" Britain should \"pick up the pace of our commitment\" and that was something Labour has been doing since it came to power last year.\n\nThe report comes as British negotiators race to agree a deal with the EU to enable British defence companies to contribute to projects funded by a new €150bn (£130bn) EU defence loan scheme  set to launch next year .\n\nThe Labour government wants to conclude a deal in the coming weeks to allow British companies to take part in the first round of bids from EU countries, with applications due by the end of this month.\n\nHealey told reporters the UK wanted to be part of the programme, but not \"at any price\", amid reports the two sides are at odds over the entry fee the UK could pay to enable British firms to take part.\n\nIt has been reported that the EU is demanding an entry fee running to billions of euros before the UK can take part.\n\nHe added that any financial contribution to take part would have to be \"good value for money for our taxpayers and our industry\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz919xyx7weo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:31:45.316+00:00","title":"Instagram and Facebook-owner Meta notifies Australian teens of accounts shutdown","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Meta, the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, and Threads, is notifying Australian teens aged 13 to 15 that their accounts will be deactivated starting 4 December 2025, as part of Australia’s new law banning under-16s from creating new accounts on social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook, Threads, TikTok, YouTube, X, and Reddit.

(UPF) in diets worldwide because of their threat to health, say international experts in a global review of research.\n\nThey say the way we eat is changing - with a move away from fresh, whole foods to cheap, highly-processed meals - which is increasing our risk of a range of chronic diseases, including obesity and depression.\n\nWriting in The Lancet , the researchers say governments need \"to step up\" and introduce warnings and higher taxes on UPF products, to help fund access to more nutritious foods.\n\nHowever some scientists say this review can not prove that UPFs directly cause health harms and more research and trials are needed to show that.\n\nUltra-processed foods are defined as containing more than five ingredients you would not find at home in your kitchen cupboard, such as emulsifiers, preservatives, additives, dyes and sweeteners.\n\nExamples of UPFs include sausages, crisps, pastries, biscuits, instant soups, fizzy drinks, ice cream and supermarket bread.\n\nSurveys indicate these industrially-manufactured foods are on the rise in diets around the world, worsening the quality of what we eat with too much sugar and unhealthy fats and a lack of fibre and protein.\n\nThis review of evidence on the impact of UPFs on health, carried out by 43 global experts and based on 104 long-term studies, suggests these foods are linked to a greater risk of 12 health conditions.\n\nThese include type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, depression and dying prematurely from any cause.\n\nReview author Prof Carlos Monteiro, from the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, who set up the Nova classification system for categorising food, said the growing consumption of ultra-processed foods \"is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals\".\n\n\"This change in what people eat is fuelled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritising ultra-processed products, supported by extensive marketing and political lobbying to stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating,\" he added.\n\nCo-author Dr Phillip Baker, from the University of Sydney, said the answer was \"a strong global public health response - like the coordinated efforts to challenge the tobacco industry\".\n\nThe review acknowledges a lack of clinical trials showing exactly how UPFs damage health - but says that should not delay action to protect people worldwide from potential health harms.\n\nSome scientists have commented that it is difficult to untangle the effects of UPFs in people's diets from other factors in people's lives, such as lifestyle, behaviour and wealth.\n\nCritics of the Nova classification system say it relies too much on the level of processing in foods, and not on how nutritious that particular food is. For example, wholegrain bread, breakfast cereals, low-fat yoghurts, baby formula milk and fish fingers all count as ultra-processed but have lots of good in them.\n\nProf Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said: \"A study like this can find a correlation, but it can't be certain about cause and effect.\"\n\nHe said there was still \"room for doubt and for clarification from further research\".\n\n\"It seems to me likely that at least some UPFs could cause increases in the risk of some chronic diseases. But this certainly doesn't establish that all UPFs increase disease risk.\"\n\nIt is still not clear what it is about ultra-processed foods that could be causing or contributing to diseases.\n\nProf Jules Griffin, from the University of Aberdeen, said there were some positive sides to food processing, and more research to understand how it influences our health was \"urgently needed\".\n\nThe Food and Drink Federation (FDF), which represents the industry, says UPFs can form part of a balanced diet, like frozen peas and wholemeal bread.\n\n\"Companies have been making a series of changes over many years to make the food and drink we all buy healthier, in line with government guidelines,\" says Kate Halliwell, chief scientific officer at the FDF.\n\nThe amount of sugar and salt in products on sale in shops and supermarkets has gone down by a third since 2015, she added.\n\nThe UK's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition  said earlier this year that the association between higher consumpton of ultra-processed foods and adverse health outcomes was \"concerning\".\n\nBut it added it was \"unclear\" whether these foods are unhealthy due to processing or because many of them are high in calories, saturated fat, salt and free sugars.\n\nCurrent UK government advice on diet is to eat more fruit, vegetables and fibre, and cut back on sugar, fat and salt."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6n6j0d3xpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:54:37.955+00:00","title":"I won't be silenced, says French anti-drugs activist after murders of two brothers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amine Kessaci, a 22-year-old anti-drugs activist from Marseille, has vowed not to be silenced after the murder of his younger brother Mehdi, 20, in November 2025.

criminals last week,  five years after the murder of his elder brother, has vowed to stand up to intimidation and \"keep telling the truth about drugs violence\".\n\nAmine Kessaci, 22, was writing in  Le Monde newspaper  a day after the funeral of his younger brother Mehdi, whose murder last week has been described by the government as a turning-point in France's drugs wars.\n\n\"Yesterday I lost my brother. Today I speak out,\" he wrote in his opinion piece.\n\n\"[The drugs-traffickers] strike at us in order to break, to tame, to subdue. They want to wipe out any resistance, to break any free spirit, to kill in the egg any embryo of revolt.\"\n\nMehdi Kessaci, 20, was shot dead last Wednesday as he parked his car in central Marseille in what appears to have been a warning or punishment aimed at his older brother, Amine, from the city's drugs gangs.\n\nSpeaking after a ministerial meeting on drugs crime at the Elysée palace on Tuesday, Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said: \"We all agreed that this premeditated murder was something totally new. It's clearly a crime of intimidation. It's a new level of violence.\"\n\nMehdi was the second Kessaci brother to be killed by drugs criminals. In 2020 the body of Brahim Kessaci, then 22, was found in a burnt-out car.\n\nThat murder prompted Amine to launch his association, Conscience, which aims to expose the damage to working-class communities caused by gangs.\n\nMarseille is renowned for worsening drugs wars, and Amine Kessaci recently wrote a book called Marseille Wipe your Tears – Life and Death in a Land of Drugs.\n\nIn his Le Monde article, Amine revealed he was recently warned by police to leave Marseille because of threats to his life.\n\nHe attended his younger brother's funeral wearing a bullet-proof jacket and under heavy police protection.\n\n\"I speak because I have no choice but to fight if I don't want to die. I speak because I know that silence is the refuge of our enemies,\" he wrote, urging courage from citizens, and action from the government.\n\nMehdi Kessaci's murder has brought the national spotlight back on a drugs trafficking problem that French experts and ministers agree is reaching almost unmanageable proportions.\n\nAccording to Senate member Étienne Blanc, author of a recent study, turnover in the drugs trade in France is now €7bn (£6bn) – or 70% of the entire budget of the justice ministry.\n\nHe said around 250,000 people drew a living from the trade in France – more than the entire number of police and gendarmes, which is 230,000. According to Le Monde, the country counts 1.1 million users of cocaine.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday launched a broadside against such consumers, telling the weekly cabinet meeting that \"sometimes it is the city-centre bourgeoisie that is funding the traffickers\".\n\nMacron had called a special drugs summit the day before in response to Amine's murder and in order to review progress on a new anti-drugs law that was passed in June.\n\nIt sets up a special prosecutor's office dedicated to organised crime - similar to the office that tackles terrorism - which will eventually have 30 specialised magistrates.\n\nUnder the law, senior drugs convicts are made to serve their terms in isolation in a specially converted prison where it is hoped it will be harder to continue running operations from behind bars.\n\nAccording to Laurent Nuñez, there is evidence that the crackdown on drugs crime is having an effect - with the number of homicides in Marseille down from 49 in 2023 to 24 in 2024.\n\nThe number of dealing points in the city had halved from 160 to 80, he added.\n\n\"The war is not won, but we do have results.\"\n\nAccording to the author of a recent book, Narcotraffic, Europe's poison ,  \"France is at the heart of the geopolitics of drugs. With its two major ports of Marseille and Le Havre, it has an ideal geographical position in this Europe of free movement.\"\n\nMathieu Verboud said that the growth in world production of cocaine had triggered an \"explosion of supply and demand. The market has gone through the roof and so have the profits.\"\n\nThe sheer wealth of drugs organisations meant they had the power to corrupt everyone from dock-workers to local politicians, the author warned, a process he said was already well-advanced in countries like the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nSeveral French politicians have said it is time to call in the army to deal with drugs-trafficking and the gangs which hold sway in many high-immigration city estates.\n\nChristian Estrosi, mayor of the southern coastal city of Nice, said: \"Narcotrafficking has transformed into narcoterrorism. Its aim now is to terrorise, subjugate and rule.\n\n\"We have already successfully deployed the means to fight terrorism. It's time to act with determination against narcoterrorism.\"\n\nEstrosi was referring to wave of deadly jihadist attacks in the mid 2010s, when France deployed hundreds of soldiers on to the streets of many cities where they continue to patrol."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p4z8q9zko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:35:54.813+00:00","title":"Hasina's conviction for crimes against humanity is testing India-Bangladesh ties","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s former leader, has been convicted of crimes against humanity for her violent suppression of student protests in 2024, leading to her ousting and exile in India.

strategically valuable - and as politically costly - as its long embrace of Bangladesh's former leader Sheikh Hasina.\n\nDuring 15 years in power she delivered what Delhi prizes most in its periphery: stability, connectivity and a neighbour willing to align its interests with India's rather than China's.\n\nThese days she is across the border in India but  has been sentenced to death  by a special tribunal in Bangladesh for crimes against humanity over her crackdown on student-led protests, which led to her ousting.\n\nThe 2024 demonstrations forced her to flee and paved the way for Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead an interim government. Elections are due early next year.\n\nThe fallout from all this has created a diplomatic bind: Dhaka wants Hasina extradited, but Delhi has shown no inclination to comply - making her death sentence effectively unenforceable.\n\nWhat Delhi intended as humanitarian asylum is turning into a long and uncomfortable test of how far it is willing to go for an old ally, and how much diplomatic capital it is prepared to burn in the process.\n\nMichael Kugelman, a South Asia expert, says India faces four unappealing options.\n\nIt could hand Hasina over - \"which it really doesn't want to do\". It could maintain the status quo, though that will become \"increasingly risky for Delhi once a newly elected government takes office next year\".\n\nOr, it could press Hasina to stay silent and avoid  statements  or  interviews , something she is \"unlikely to accept\" as she continues to lead her Awami League party - and something Delhi is unlikely to enforce.\n\nThe remaining option is to find a third country to take her in, but that too is fraught: few governments are likely to accept a \"high-maintenance guest with serious legal problems and security needs\", Mr Kugelman says.\n\nExtraditing Hasina is unthinkable - India's ruling party and opposition alike view her as a close friend. \"India prides itself on not turning on its friends,\" according to Mr Kugelman.\n\nWhat makes this moment especially awkward for Delhi is the sheer depth - and asymmetry - of the India–Bangladesh relationship, rooted in India's pivotal role in Bangladesh's birth.\n\nBangladesh is India's biggest trading partner in South Asia, and India has become Bangladesh's largest export market in Asia. Total trade reached nearly $13bn (£10bn) last year, with Bangladesh running a sizeable deficit, heavily dependent on Indian raw materials, energy and transit routes.\n\nIndia has offered $8bn-$10bn in concessional credit over the past decade, provides duty-free access to some goods, built cross-border rail links, and supplies electricity - plus oil and LNG - from Indian grids and ports. This is not a relationship either side can easily walk away from.\n\n\"India and Bangladesh share a complex interdependence - relying on each other for water, electricity and more. It would be difficult for Bangladesh to function without India's co-operation,\" says Sanjay Bhardwaj, a professor of South Asian studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n\nYet, many believe, Bangladesh's interim government, under Yunus, appears to now be moving quickly to rebalance its external ties. His first months in office have been a burst of diplomatic outreach aimed at \"de-Indianising\" Bangladesh's foreign policy, according to political scientist Bian Sai in a  paper  published by the National University of Singapore.\n\nA government that once aligned itself with India at every regional forum is now cancelling judicial exchanges, renegotiating Indian energy deals, slowing India-led connectivity projects, and leaning publicly on Beijing, Islamabad and even Ankara for strategic partnership. Many believe the message could not be clearer: Bangladesh, once India's most dependable neighbour, is hedging hard.\n\nThe deterioration is already visible in public sentiment. A recent  survey  by the Dhaka-based Centre for Alternatives found more than 75% of Bangladeshis viewed ties with Beijing positively, compared with just 11% for Delhi - reflecting sentiments after last year's uprising. Many blame Delhi for supporting an increasingly authoritarian Hasina in her final years, and see India as an overbearing neighbour.\n\nProf Bharadwaj says that long-standing economic and cultural ties often endure beyond political shifts: data show that trade between India and Bangladesh grew between 2001 and 2006, when the \"less friendlier\" Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), was in power.\n\n\"While diplomatic and political relations often fluctuate with changes in government, economic, cultural and sports ties tend to remain largely stable. Even if a new administration is less friendly toward India, it does not automatically disrupt trade or broader bilateral relations,\" he says.\n\nFor Delhi, the challenge is not just managing a fallen ally in exile, but preserving a neighbour central to its security - from counterterrorism and border management to access to its restive north-eastern region. India shares a 4,096km (2,545 mile) largely porous and partly riverine border with Bangladesh, where domestic turbulence could trigger displacement or mobilisation of extremists, experts say.\n\n\"India should not be in a hurry,\" says Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London. The path forward, he argues, requires \"quiet, patient engagement with key political stakeholders in Dhaka -including the armed forces\". Diplomacy can buy time.\n\nDr Paliwal believes the relationship is likely to remain turbulent over the next 12–18 months, with the intensity depending on developments in Bangladesh after next year's elections.\n\n\"If the interim government is able to pull off elections with credibility, and an elected government takes charges, it could open options for the two sides to renegotiate the relationship and limit the damage.\"\n\nThe uncertainty has Delhi weighing not just immediate tactical moves, but the broader principle: How can India reassure friendly governments that it will stand by them \"through thick and thin\" without inviting accusations that it is shielding leaders with troubling human rights records?\n\n\"There are no silver-bullet operational solutions to this dilemma. Perhaps the deeper question that requires mulling is why India faces the dilemma in the first place,\" says Dr Paliwal. In other words, did Delhi put too many eggs in one basket by backing Hasina so consistently?\n\n\"You deal with whoever is in power, is friendly, and helps you get your job done. Why should you change that?\" says Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh. \"Foreign policy isn't driven by public perception or morality - relations between states rarely are.\n\n\"Internally, we can't control Bangladesh's politics - it's fractious, deeply divisive, and built on fragile institutions.\"\n\nWhether India can repair the deeper political rupture remains uncertain. At the same time, much depends on Bangladesh's next government. \"The key is how much Bangladesh's next government lets the Hasina factor impact bilateral relations. If it essentially holds the relationship hostage, then it will be tough to move forward,\" says Mr Kugelman.\n\nUltimately, the next elected government will need to balance Bangladesh's core interests - border security, trade and connectivity - against domestic politics and public anti-India sentiment, he says.\n\n\"I don't anticipate a serious crisis in ties, but I suspect they'll remain fragile at best.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m3ddkn3gdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"11:57:48.036+00:00","title":"Wicked: For Good leaves critics less spellbound than the first film","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The sequel to the 2024 film Wicked, titled Wicked: For Good, has received mixed but generally positive reviews from critics.

Clarisse Loughrey  in a two-star review.\n\n\"If your complaint about last year's Wicked was that it was so oddly lit that you could barely see what was going on, then fear not – in Wicked: For Good, you won't mind so much, because there's so little to look at.\"\n\nIn a one-star review,  the Telegraph's Robbie Collin said:  \"It doesn't amount to two hours of story – the stage show clips through the same plot in around half the time – and the padding is as obvious as it is exhausting.\"\n\nHe suggested the central pair's friendship \"rings false\", adding: \"What should be piercing, impassioned moments are by turns frivolous and sappy.\"\n\nHowever,  Kevin Maher of the Times was  much more positive, awarding the film four stars.\n\n\"They've only gone and done it,\" he said. \"The makers of this musical sequel have delivered a film that surpasses last year's box-office smash in verve, ambition and emotional ache.\"\n\nBoth movies have been directed by Jon M Chu, who was also behind Crazy Rich Asians, In The Heights and Now You See Me 2.\n\nChu is also set to direct a new big-screen adaptation of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, pencilled in for release

the pop star shows \"fragility\" in her more \"nuanced\" performance.\n\n\"Whereas Grande had a relatively one-dimensional role to play in part one, Glinda now faces a complex evolution,\" he said.\n\n\"Grande has been acting since she was a kid,\"  noted the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney,  \"and her quiet moments of introspection, anxiety or sadness show tender depths, as does her loyalty to Elphaba.\"\n\nBut he also praised her co-star. \"Make no mistake, Erivo remains a powerhouse, with pipes that shake the heavens and a wellspring of unforced emotional intensity that never runs dry.\"\n\n\"What a performance from Erivo,\"  agreed the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw  in a four-star review.\n\nHe added the sequel as a whole \"keeps the rainbow-coloured dreaminess and the Broadway show tune zinginess from part one\".\n\nThe stage musical was split into two parts for its film adaptation, but the two movies were filmed in one go.\n\nThe first was released last November and grossed more than £750m at the box office worldwide.\n\nIt went on to win two Oscars and two Baftas, for costume and production design, as well as the cinematic and box office achievement prize at the Golden Globes.\n\nOne problem facing the sequel is that most of Wicked's best-known songs, including Popular and The Wizard and I, appeared in the first film.\n\nIt's an issue it shares with the Broadway and West End musical. \"On stage, the second act lacks a song as strong as Defying Gravity,\" Debruge noted.\n\nIn his Empire review of Wicked: For Good, Nugent concluded: \"The tone is different from that of the first film: less peppy, more glum.\n\n\"With the exception of Goldblum - who appears to be acting in his own film, delighting in stuttery drollness - all the characters are much less cheerful than they were last time around, and as a result it's less enjoyable for us to watch.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/us/politics/contempt-inquiry-deportation-flights.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:22:55-05:00","title":"Stalled

Boasberg sent a warning to the Justice Department, threatening to open a contempt investigation into whether the Trump administration had violated an order he had issued directing officials to stop flights of Venezuelan immigrants from being sent to El Salvador in March.\n\nBut Judge Boasberg’s efforts to hold the administration accountable for the flights — a move backed up by an explosive whistle-blower complaint — was put on hold by a higher court, where it languished for much of the year. It was largely forgotten as public attention pivoted elsewhere in the endless flow of news that has marked President Trump’s second term in office.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, the contempt proceeding suddenly came back to life as Judge Boasberg, in the wake of an appeals court ruling late last week, took the bench at a hearing in Federal District Court in Washington and laid out a series of next steps in his investigation.\n\nThe judge said he wanted to hear testimony from witnesses who were involved in the deportation case — chief among them Erez Reuveni, a former Justice Department lawyer who had worked on the matter and filed the whistle-blower complaint that touched on his role in it after he was fired by the department in a related proceeding.\n\nThe judge said he also might want to hear from Drew Ensign, another Justice Department lawyer who had conveyed to administration officials his initial order to stop the flights of immigrants.\n\nAt the hearing, a different lawyer for the department told Judge Boasberg that the administration opposed reopening the long-stalled contempt investigation. But the judge had little patience for the objection.\n\n“I intend to proceed just like I did in April, seven months ago,” he said, adding, “This has been sitting for a long time and justice requires me to move quickly.”\n\nThe resurrected inquiry could finally get to the bottom of questions that have lingered since the first few months of the Trump administration: Did any top officials at the Justice Department or at other federal agencies purposefully disregard Judge Boasberg’s order to stop the planes from going to El Salvador? And if so, who? And why?\n\nLee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been representing the Venezuelan men, said he believed that Judge Boasberg would eventually get answers to the questions.\n\n“He was right to want to investigate at the beginning of the summer and now there’s a mountain of additional evidence showing the Trump administration deliberately violated his order, an order that would have spared these individuals months of extreme abuse and torture,” Mr. Gelernt said.\n\nThe deportation flights were part of an early effort by the White House to send scores of Venezuelan men accused of being members of the violent street gang Tren de Aragua to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the expansive authority of a wartime law passed more than two centuries ago. That law, known as the Alien Enemies Act, gives the president sweeping powers to detain and deport members of a hostile foreign nation in a time of war or during an invasion of the country.\n\nThe question of whether Mr. Trump used the act properly to expel the Venezuelans is now being considered by a different court in Texas and is likely to ultimately make its way to the Supreme Court. Judge Boasberg’s contempt proceeding will focus solely on the issue of whether administration officials complied with his instructions during an emergency Zoom hearing on March 15 to ground any deportation flights bound for El Salvador that day and turn around any planes that were already in the air.\n\nThat never happened, leaving nearly 140 Venezuelans in the custody of jailers at El Salvador’s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT. Those men were subsequently sent back to their homeland. Some are seeking, in a new action that was also argued on Wednesday, to get an order from Judge Boasberg that would allow them to return to the United States.\n\nAccording to Mr. Reuveni’s complaint, a pivotal meeting about the deportation flights occurred on March 14, when Emil Bove III, then an official in the deputy attorney general’s office, spoke bluntly about the administration’s plans. Mr. Bove informed his subordinates that Mr. Trump would soon invoke the Alien Enemies Act to fly the immigrants out of the country that same weekend. Two other officials in the deputy attorney general’s office — James McHenry and Paul Perkins — were in attendance, as well as Mr. Reuveni’s supervisors, Mr. Ensign and August Flentje, according to the whistle-blower document.\n\nMr. Bove “stressed to all in attendance that the planes needed to take off no matter what,” according to Mr. Reuveni’s account. Mr. Bove then broached “the possibility that a court order would enjoin those removals before they could be effectuated.”\n\n“Bove stated that D.O.J. would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you’ and ignore any such order,” according to the account. “Mr. Reuveni perceived that others in the room looked stunned, and he observed awkward, nervous glances among people in the room. Silence overtook the room.”\n\nThe No. 2 official at the Justice Department, Todd Blanche, has denied Mr. Reuveni’s account.\n\nJudge Boasberg’s initial order laying out the contempt investigation outlined an aggressive process for figuring out what had happened inside the administration. He said, for instance, that he might go so far as to refer the case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution if he determined there had been contempt.\n\nMoreover, recognizing the unlikelihood that the department under Mr. Trump’s control would actually bring charges, he said he would consider another final gambit: using a special provision of the criminal contempt law that permits him, as the judge in the case, to appoint a lawyer from outside the department to prosecute contempt.\n\nA three-judge panel of the federal appeals court in Washington, citing those aggressive proposals, killed the inquiry temporarily but said that Judge Boasberg could move forward if it managed to avoid being coercive.\n\nLawyers for the A.C.L.U. then asked the full appeals court to consider the panel’s ruling. And on Friday, the court effectively sent the case back to Judge Boasberg, saying he could proceed.\n\n“Respect for judicial orders, and courts’ independence, are essential to the rule of law,” the appeals court wrote.\n\n"},{"source":"https://cooking.nytimes.com/article/pies-thanksgiving-desserts","dateOfPublication":"0000-01-01","timeOfPublication":"00:00:00.000Z","title":"6 Pies So Good, You’ll Want to Skip Dinner","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article introduces a collection of easy, flavorful, and visually striking pie recipes ideal for Thanksgiving, emphasizing accessibility, balance in sweetness, and creative modern twists.

Thanksgiving: apple and cream, chocolaty espresso, honeyed cranberry, and more.\n\nGo straight to the good stuff this Thanksgiving: apple and cream, chocolaty espresso, honeyed cranberry, and more.\n\nIn the world of baked goods, it’s said that people usually fall into one of two camps: cake lovers or pie lovers. But we shouldn’t be so prescriptive. You can dream of both fluffy layer cakes and showstopping pies. You can find yourself craving a bite of chocolate cake one day, while yearning for apple pie the next.\n\nThat’s where my passion lies. I didn’t grow up having pie. Instead, my family and I ate cake: vanilla sponges from Chinese bakeries, sandwiching fresh whipped cream and sliced fruit, that were just sweet enough. It wasn’t until I was as an adult working at food magazines that I began making and eating pies. I came to find the whole process incredibly rewarding.\n\nUnlike a cake, which requires cooling and then frosting, a pie is ready to eat soon after you pull it from the oven, once it has taken a moment to cool — and in some of the cases below, it’s ready right away.\n\nYou don’t have to be a pie expert — or even a die-hard pie lover — to make the recipes in this collection. The pies below channel classic Thanksgiving flavors, but they’re also fruity, tangy and creamy like the cakes of my youth. (And, critically, they aren’t too sweet.) They’re also all stunning and delicious, and, most important, they’re easy, each one streamlined for success. For beginners, gingery-sweet crumb crusts and crunchy phyllo step in for trickier pie crust. The one pie that does call for dough has a simple twist: The top is shingled rather than woven into a lattice, creating a stunning result with little effort, so you can have your pie and eat it, too.\n\nThis pie takes inspiration from classic pumpkin pie, but it uses nearly the entire squash — flesh and skin — for both filling and garnish. The custard rests in a graham cracker crust, which I believe is the ideal choice for a pumpkin pie, since the crumbs actually benefit from absorbing some of the custard’s moisture. Garnished with candied squash slices, this pie is both a visual treat and a delicious one.\n\nIf I had to pick a favorite of this batch, it would be this one. The pie dough is forgiving, easy to work with and, best of all, requires no crimping. I encourage you to experiment with your top-crust design and then simply let the dough do its magic in the oven. A touch of heavy cream adds an unexpectedly perfect silkiness to the apples.\n\nHojicha, a toasted green tea from Japan with a smoky sweetness, is incorporated into a cream cheese custard with a subtle cream cheese swirl, guaranteeing that this pie will be the star of Thanksgiving. (Thankfully, this pie also travels well wherever you take it.) Baked in a shortbread crust, it feels almost like an elegant tart.\n\nThe simplest of the bunch (no pun intended) with ingredients that are available year-round, this sweet-tart banana pie skips the traditional crust in favor of phyllo dough, creating a dramatic, ruffly edge. The custard has a slight tang from the sour cream, which beautifully balances out the sometimes overly sweet banana.\n\nBuilt on a chocolate graham cracker crust with rich layers of chocolate and espresso pudding, this silky treat feels like the fanciest version of a diner-style pie. Each slice is stunning, with contrasting pudding layers and a tall cap of unsweetened whipped cream.\n\nThis dreamy creation combines lush cranberry and vanilla-honey mousses to create mesmerizing swirls of pink and white. It recalls the flavor of Yakult, a popular yogurt-like drink in East Asian cultures, and each bite melts in your mouth. A small amount of gelatin helps the mousses set and keeps them picture-perfect on the Thanksgiving table.\n\nFollow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

Mr. Capone studied case law, called a lawyer, requested a hearing, ran for the HOA board and kept the lights glowing for years.\n\nPotomac Yard is in Alexandria, Va., an affluent Washington suburb that is home to lawyers, federal workers, government contractors and politicians, including more than 100 members of Congress. Alexandria voted 77 percent for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and so did Potomac Yard. Mr. Capone voted for President Trump twice.\n\nThose politics, along with strong personalities and an exacting HOA that bans everything from brass front doorknobs to window boxes, have driven nearly five years of war between Mr. Capone and his outraged board. The battle stands out for its excess. Mr. Capone has spent $40,000 suing the HOA over his right to plant a Mickey Mouse flag in his front flower pot and revoke the street parking privileges of 22 neighbors. Seeking to oust him from leadership, his association started a multimedia campaign, including a video of his Zoom meeting outbursts that drew eyeballs from several states.\n\nThe case is another example of how the nation’s partisan divide has reached the hyperlocal level. Nearly one-quarter of Americans belong to an HOA, whose dominion over private property draws ever more complaints. In Florida, where nearly half of residents live in HOA communities, a Republican state legislator, Representative Juan Carlos Porras, is “seriously considering” legislation banning the associations entirely.\n\n“We should not have authoritarian boards dictate your day to day life with no accountability,” he wrote on X.\n\nMr. Capone, while hardly alone in his efforts, is singular in his approach. He calls it “targeting the devil.”\n\n“He’d be better off living on a rural road where he can just throw garbage out the back door,\" said Patrick Doherty, a board member of the homeowners’ association. “But he chose to live in an HOA.”\n\nA court in Virginia is set to decide who is right.\n\nMr. Capone, 50, sells cybersecurity systems to defense contractors and other corporations. He and his wife, Vanina Colombo, a human resources director who was born in Argentina, have lived in a three-bedroom townhouse in Potomac Yard since 2015, shortly before the birth of their twin daughters, now 9.\n\nMr. Capone has no legal training, but years of wrangling over property rights have turned him into a kind of townhouse lawyer who likes to quote case law and statutes.\n\nThe Potomac Yard HOA charges members $125 a month, which it spends mostly on snow removal and storm water management, insurance, common area maintenance and landscaping. It enforces its rules governing property exteriors through citations and occasional fines.\n\nThe rules ban garden sheds, jungle gyms, sandboxes, awnings, clotheslines, birdhouses, birdbaths and feeders. Residents may display an American flag, but no garden flags, banners or political signs. Homes are painted by the builder in one of 21 colors, and homeowners cannot change a house that was originally painted Green Porcelain to Rembrandt Ruby, for example. All exterior doorknobs and locks must be finished in “satin nickel.”\n\nLandscaping, including of individual homes, is done by the HOA. When plants need replacement, residents work with the landscaping committee, which keeps a list of approved native species.\n\nTo broadcast his belief in “free use and inalienability of property,” Mr. Capone has festooned his house with HOA-prohibited décor. He planted cartoon garden flags in the hedges, installed as many as four bird feeders and wrote Trump campaign messages on his garage and alley pavement in chalk last year. He displayed a Trump banner in front.\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Capone won the HOA board seat previously occupied by Rickey E. Dana, a communications professional. Ms. Dana had originally joined the association’s leadership to push for change, after its rules prohibited her from changing the color of her front door from “rotten salmon” to blue. But Mr. Capone had already irritated several of his neighbors, sometimes by photographing their homes and reporting what he viewed as violations to the HOA rules. He also posted various complaints on Nextdoor, the neighborhood-based social media platform.\n\nOnce on the board, Mr. Capone began digging through financial records and governing documents, searching for activity that went beyond the association’s legal powers. He homed in on street parking and landscaping policy.\n\nAlexandria required that Potomac Yard’s developer provide homeowners with parking, but two dozen of its 250 townhouses were built without garages. The HOA reserved parking spaces for them on an adjacent private road, which it owns, but Mr. Capone argued that it was illegal to give them exclusive right to those spaces since the road belonged to all residents, whose assessments paid to maintain it.\n\nNeighbors say that to prove his point, Mr. Capone ignores stop signs on the road or drives its length while blowing his car horn. In a public meeting, he said that because the road was private, stop signs were “nothing more than a mere suggestion.”\n\nMr. Capone further believes that the HOA should not maintain the landscaping surrounding individual homes. He accused board members of personally profiting from the parking and landscaping policies.\n\nBoard meetings soon devolved into a cacophony of charges, countercharges and shouting. Mr. Capone told board members they were “charging my kids for your customized landscaping” and accused the landscaping chairwoman of self-dealing for having some plants replaced.\n\nAs Mr. Capone berated her, “the heartbeat monitor on my Apple Watch went off,” said Mr. Doherty of the HOA board.\n\nMr. Capone’s accusations rattled the board. It halted its annual compliance inspections and conducted a review of legal documents, overseen by a lawyer who works in HOA law. The association says its legal bills grew to $139,000 in 2023 from $21,000 in 2021, before Mr. Capone joined the board.\n\nThe other four board members and several neighbors debated what to do. Removing a board member required approval from a majority of 725 homeowners in a community where most HOA meetings draw fewer than a half-dozen attendees. It would take an enormous campaign to oust Mr. Capone. Ms. Dana, the former board member, recalled discussions of whether that would be legal, ethical or counterproductive.\n\n“But then we were like, ‘Eye for an eye, baby,’” she said. “‘Bring it.’”\n\nIn October 2023, Ms. Dana started a petition on Change.org that sought to remove Mr. Capone “for disruptive behavior and misuse of power” and asserted that he had bombarded the board and related targets with 9,000 pages of emails containing “baseless accusations, insults, plots for personal vendetta, etc.”\n\nTwo neighbors created a website, RemoveFrankCapone.org, with a 35-minute sizzle reel of Mr. Capone erupting during meetings.\n\nHOA members who worked nearby at the Pentagon rose before dawn to deliver fliers to everyone in the “core area of operation,” as they called the neighborhood.\n\nMr. Capone disputes the number of emails but said he did have to send a lot because “the association was supposed to have a message board and never had it.”\n\nAs news of the battle spread among HOA members in the region, Mr. Capone complained to Change.org about the petition, and the site redacted his name. He sued Ms. Dana for defamation, seeking $9,800 in a small claims court in Virginia. In court, she produced a spreadsheet of his thousands of emails and transcripts from the board meetings. He lost.\n\nHe reported the RemoveFrankCapone.org website to the police. Its creators moved it to a private server.\n\nIn December 2023, Potomac Yard residents voted 405 to 4 to oust Mr. Capone from the board.\n\n“They attacked me because I’m a whistle-blower,” he said, “and I guess I got their attention.”\n\nAfter Mr. Capone’s ouster, the board began fining him as much as $50 a day for each violation outside his home. The penalties eventually reached $5,000.\n\nIn March, Mr. Capone and Ms. Colombo sued the Potomac Yard Homeowners Association in Alexandria Circuit Court. The suit challenged the reserved parking spaces and claimed that design provisions in the HOA governing documents did not specifically prohibit garden flags and bird feeders, among other décor.\n\nDespite the lawsuit, Mr. Capone has run in every board election since his ouster, saying he represents a “silent majority” of homeowners who agree with him. He has lost each time.\n\nAsked why he moved to Potomac Yard in the first place, he had a ready answer. “Mainly, location,” he said. Also it was less expensive than downtown Alexandria.\n\nThis year, he withdrew his candidacy, saying his lawsuit could pose a conflict. He got nine votes anyway; the winner received 238.\n\nDuring a visit to the couple’s home, Ms. Colombo said her husband’s fight “is what it is.”\n\nShe does not love the clutter outside their home, and with the $450 an hour they are paying a lawyer they could be “traveling the world with the kids,” she said.\n\nLast month, Mr. Capone notched an incremental victory.\n\nOn Oct. 8, an Alexandria Circuit Court judge denied the Potomac Yard HOA’s motion to dismiss Mr. Capone’s case. He set a trial for early April.\n\nMr. Capone was ebullient.\n\n“Once we win,” he said, “we’re probably going to go after them again, for other things.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/business/pif-saudi-arabia-fund-problems.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:08:10-05:00","title":"Saudi Arabia’s Prince Has Big Plans, but His Giant Fund Is Low on Cash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reveals that despite Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s public promises of a $1 trillion investment in the U.S. and bold economic transformation, the country’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) is facing severe financial strain. Once a modest fund, PIF has been overextended through ambitious and often delayed projects such as Neom, a failed coffee chain, and an electric vehicle startup. Behind the scenes, PIF is restructuring, cutting financial projections, firing project leaders, and shifting toward more liquid investments like publicly traded stocks. It now requires international investors to help bail out older, underperforming ventures in return for future funding.

In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told reporters, without providing details, that his nation would invest $1 trillion in America.\n\nBut a different reality is being whispered about in the power corridors of Riyadh and Wall Street: The kingdom’s vaunted Public Investment Fund, which Saudi Arabia has typically used to fulfill commitments like the one it made this week in Washington, is running low on cash for new investments.\n\nThat’s in large part because Prince Mohammed and his deputies have spent a vast portion of the nation’s bounty on projects that are in financial distress, and they are frantically trying to turn things around, according to 11 people briefed on its operations, including current employees, board members, investors and their representatives.\n\nThere is Neom, a vast would-be utopian region on the nation’s northern tip that was to feature robot workers, a ski resort and beaches of crushed marble but has instead confronted mountains of delays.\n\nThen there are other, more conventional projects in the ever-expanding PIF portfolio that are nowhere near fruition, such as a coffee chain with one shop so far and dreams of exporting beans to Austria; a cruise line with one ship; and an electric vehicle start-up begun three years ago that has yet to deliver a car.\n\nThe kingdom still sits on deep oil wealth. Its ability to pump, however, is heavily constricted by geopolitical agreements to curtail supply and a low price for crude overall. The government is running a growing budget deficit and taking on debt to fulfill Prince Mohammed’s domestic promises.\n\nWhile PIF says it holds nearly $1 trillion in assets, a huge portion of its portfolio is tied up in hard-to-sell assets for which no public valuations are available. Its representatives have begun telling international investors that it is all but unable to allocate any more money for the foreseeable future, six people with knowledge of those discussions said.\n\nUnlike some other comparable sovereign wealth funds, PIF posts only a page and a half of annual financial figures.\n\nA spokesman for the fund, Marwan Bakrali, said it had $60 billion in cash and similar financial instruments. He described it as “very liquid by regional standards.”\n\nBehind the scenes, PIF is actively restructuring its operations under the watchful eye of the crown prince, said the people briefed, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential business plans.\n\nThe prince has fired the head of at least one of its more imperiled projects, Neom, according to two people briefed on the matter. Meanwhile, the fund is furiously slashing internal financial projections for various investments, including a string of luxury resorts on the Red Sea that sit mostly empty.\n\nIts board is also drawing up plans to act differently in the future by investing in more conventional areas such as publicly traded stocks and bonds, one of the people said. It hopes to double in size to $2 trillion in the next five years, although it’s unclear how much of that would come from investment gains and how much would be new money from the Saudi government.\n\n“As a long-term investor,” Mr. Bakrali said, “our investments will be judged over generations, not quarters, and the returns will be measured both financially and through economic and societal impact.”\n\nIn the meantime, PIF’s bigger moves in recent months have been yet more private investments, this time in artificial intelligence companies.\n\nThe largest investment by PIF this autumn was bid for a controlling stake in the world’s largest video game maker, Electronic Arts. PIF’s representatives say it’s a long-term investment that will eventually double in value. People close to the fund point to another motivating factor: Prince Mohammed is an avid gamer.\n\nThe world of sovereign wealth funds can be a staid place. The world’s largest, Norway’s $2 trillion Government Pension Fund Global, invests largely in publicly traded stocks.\n\nOther countries’ funds look inward, such as India’s, which is barred from investing outside the nation.\n\nFor much of its history, PIF was not much different. It was created in 1971, funded by the Saudi government squarely to finance domestic companies such as nationally run banks and electric utilities.\n\nBy 2015, it had roughly $100 billion in assets, 50 staff members and zero name recognition. That March, a new Saudi king transferred control of the entity to his third wife’s eldest son, Prince Mohammed, then 29 years old.\n\nAnd the prince turned PIF into a central tool in his roll-up of power, so much so that PIF now says that was the year it was “reborn.”\n\nPrince Mohammed packed PIF with government cash, took out loans and redirected some of the nation’s oil sales (currently estimated by outsiders at $500 million per day) to the fund. He also transferred in assets that had been seized from political opponents and family members in what was termed an “anti-corruption” effort.\n\nThe government has attributed 1.1 million Saudi jobs to PIF projects, though that claim cannot be independently verified.\n\nPIF itself now has more than 3,000 staff members. Its annual report, released in August, indicates that its revenue increased 25 percent in the preceding year.\n\nThe expansion has also been huge for Yasir al-Rumayyan, the fund’s governor. A regional banker for most of his career, he said in one podcast interview that Prince Mohammed initially tapped him to find candidates to lead PIF. The royal, Mr. al-Rumayyan said, “wasn’t fully satisfied with the majority” and chose the man searching instead.\n\nHe has reveled in the role — showing one visitor a photo of his yacht — and goes so far as to sharply correct those who pronounce the fund’s name “Piff,” as opposed to spelling out the initials, according to three people who have heard him say so.\n\nMr. al-Rumayyan attended the Super Bowl last year with Benjamin Horowitz, whose venture capital firm manages money for PIF, and sat at Mr. Trump’s side last November at the post-election Ultimate Fighting Championship match at Madison Square Garden.\n\nHe has taken stakes for Saudi Arabia in American companies like Uber and Citi, and created a global league around his personal hobby, golf. Sports leagues and teams — including big brands like Formula 1 and the English Premier League team Newcastle United — sold stakes to PIF’s funds.\n\nPIF has also made some opportune bets in the public markets, including building a huge portfolio in U.S. stocks amid their pandemic nadir, which proved profitable when prices rebounded.\n\nMr. al-Rumayyan declined to be interviewed.\n\nRegarding PIF’s restructuring, Ahmed al-Khateeb, a PIF board member and Saudi Arabia’s tourism minister, characterized the moves as natural steps in Prince Mohammed’s broader effort to overhaul the Saudi economy.\n\n“You stop, you assess what went right, what went wrong, and then you improve,” Mr. al-Khateeb said.\n\nA major symbol of the influence of PIF and Mr. al-Rumayyan has been the Future Investment Initiative, dubbed Davos in the Desert, an annual gathering that hosts thousands of people in the nation’s capital.\n\nHistorically, among the most sought-after parties coinciding with the event has been a gathering at Mr. al-Rumayyan’s palm-tree-lined villa, formerly owned by a magnate jailed in Prince Mohammed’s infamous 2017 roundup of political opponents.\n\nSo when about 100 titans of global finance and industry convened at his villa, there would have seemed little reason to expect anything other than the usual cavalcade of abu al-karavatta, the dismissive term that some locals use to refer to tie-wearing out-of-towners seeking the kingdom’s cash.\n\nAs Mr. al-Rumayyan rose to give welcoming remarks in his personal ballroom, with waiters poised to serve lamb and rice, he was greeted by an unusual sight.\n\nAn unoccupied seat was marked with a place card for the private-equity billionaire Stephen A. Schwarzman, who had attended every prior annual dinner and whose firm, Blackstone, has made a small fortune off its relationship with the kingdom.\n\nMr. Schwarzman’s absence was noted by attendees, but he did arrive, hours late (after dessert). His spokeswoman blamed traffic.\n\nThroughout the conference, there was a sense of change, with wistful talk of a headier time for Westerners when it felt like most visiting businesspeople to Riyadh would return home with cash.\n\nThis year, PIF’s representatives told asset managers of new conditions for future investments: The only way it would give them more is in exchange for help bailing out its older investments, according to two of the fund’s staff members and five investors or their representatives.\n\nIn one illustrative deal outlined by a person who was in negotiations for an investment from PIF, the Saudi fund said it would allocate more money only if more than double its investment was funneled back into private Saudi companies.\n\nThe upshot would be international money flowing into PIF-owned projects, bolstering their status.\n\nOf reinvesting PIF’s money into private Saudi companies, another PIF spokesman, Rupert Trefgarne, said: “There’s no requirement. There’s certainly an encouragement.”\n\nEven the company that runs the annual conference itself is on the block. Majority owned by PIF, earlier this year it hired a U.S. investment bank to explore options, including selling itself to an outsider for cash, according to two people consulted by Future Investment Initiative executives.\n\nNo such buyer could be found. PIF now hopes to list shares in the conference organizer on the Saudi Stock Exchange, which it also owns. PIF’s spokesman said that had always been the plan.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/technology/nvidia-earnings.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:41:37-05:00","title":"Nvidia’s Profit Jumps 65% to $31.9 Billion.

Is It Enough for Wall Street?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-19T16:41:37-05:00\n\nJust three weeks ago, Nvidia became the first publicly traded company to be worth more than $5 trillion thanks to the cutting edge computer chips it makes for artificial intelligence.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia provided a reminder of just how much the world craves those chips. The company said that in its most recent quarter, its profit was $31.9 billion, up 65 percent from a year ago and 245 percent from the year before that. Among the tech industry’s giants, only Google’s parent company, Alphabet, made more money in the same quarter.\n\nNvidia controls about 90 percent of the market for the chips used in A.I. projects, and its financial performance has become a bellwether for what can be expected of the rest of the tech industry, which is investing trillions of dollars in big data centers all over the world.\n\nNvidia’s eye-popping profits could be enough to calm nerves on Wall Street, where there are increasing concerns that lavish spending is getting way ahead of demand for the products and services Silicon Valley’s engineers are building.\n\nThe S&P 500 is down 3.6 percent since Nvidia, the most valuable publicly traded company in the world, hit its $5 trillion milestone. Shares of Nvidia have fallen 10 percent during that time, though they are still up 34 percent so far this year.\n\nNvidia has experienced heady growth since the A.I. boom started three years ago, and the most recent quarter was no different. In the three months that ended in October, the company said sales of its chips for A.I. data centers rose 44 percent to $51 billion. The business helped lift the company’s total revenue to $57 billion, eclipsing Wall Street’s expectations for sales of $55.2 billion.\n\nImportantly, Nvidia also provided hints that a company with a stranglehold on an essential product can continue growing fast, even as total sales mushroom. Nvidia’s revenue in the current quarter is projected to rise 65 percent from a year ago to $65 billion, in line with recent quarters. The forecast blew past Wall Street’s forecast for sales of $57 billion.\n\n“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Jensen Huang, the company’s chief executive and co-founder, said in a news release. “Compute demand keeps accelerating.”\n\nShares of the company rose more than 3 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nIn recent months, Nvidia has worried investors because it is making investments in some of the customers that buy its chips. The deals have raised questions about whether Nvidia is paying itself. For example, it announced it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT. The start-up receives that money as it buys or leases Nvidia’s chips.\n\nOn Tuesday, it announced a similar deal with another A.I. company: Nvidia will invest $10 billion in Anthropic, which will purchase $30 billion in A.I. computing backed by Nvidia chips. Goldman Sachs has estimated that Nvidia will make about 15 percent of its sales next year from what critics call circular deals.\n\n“The fundamentals for the company are still intact, but you have these clouds that keep popping up,” said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus, a bank.\n\nJensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, has defended Nvidia’s investments. Speaking at a news briefing in Washington last month, he said that Nvidia hadn’t invested any of the $100 billion yet and that the deal was really an invitation to invest “along the way” as OpenAI builds toward an eventual public listing.\n\nNvidia is also facing questions about increased competition. AMD, which also makes high-quality A.I. chips, recently struck its own deal with OpenAI; and Qualcomm, another chipmaker, struck a deal to sell its A.I. products to Saudi Arabia.\n\nMr. Huang has remained optimistic about Nvidia’s prospects. Last month, he revealed that the company was expecting $500 billion in sales through the end of next year, which would more than double what it made over the previous two years.\n\nThe company’s sales are growing, even as it remains blocked from selling to China. Beijing has discouraged Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips, hindering its access to the world’s largest semiconductor market. Mr. Huang had been campaigning President Trump to approve the sale of Nvidia’s latest line of chips to China and encouraging Beijing to allow companies to buy them.\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s advisers discouraged him from weighing in on the issue for national security reasons when he recently met with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Mr. Trump instead said that Mr. Huang would have to negotiate directly with the Chinese.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/world/europe/us-russia-ukraine-peace-plan.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"17:49:22-05:00","title":"U.S.-Russian Peace Plan Would Force Ukraine to Cede Land and Cut Army","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A proposed peace plan between the U.S. and Russia, negotiated without Ukrainian input, would require Ukraine to surrender the entire eastern Donbas region, drastically reduce its army size, relinquish long-range weapons, and recognize occupied territories such as Crimea as Russian.

between the Trump administration and Russia, would require Kyiv to surrender territory, significantly reduce the size of its army and relinquish some types of weaponry, according to officials familiar with the proposal.\n\nThe 28-point proposal, drafted without Ukrainian involvement, reflects the maximalist demands the Kremlin has made throughout the war, which Ukraine has long denounced as amounting to capitulation. Parts of the plan were described by two officials who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly — one Ukrainian and one who did not want to be identified by country.\n\nIt is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reinvigorate stalled settlement talks in the nearly four-year-old war. But some Ukrainian commentators also saw the proposal as a bid by Russia to press Ukraine for concessions while the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky is weakened by a high-level corruption scandal, which could dissuade allies from sending aid. Kyiv is also under growing pressure on the battlefield, as Moscow’s forces make gains against a Ukrainian military that is stretched thin.\n\n“One thing is clear,” said Kostiantyn Yelisieiev, a former presidential foreign policy adviser. “Ukraine’s position right now is not strong, and this is seen not only inside the country but also by our partners, including the United States, and of course by the aggressor.” Mr. Yelisieiev is in the political opposition to Mr. Zelensky.\n\nThe White House did not comment on the contents of the proposal. Asked by reporters about the plan, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, said, “Don’t have any news or announcement to make on that.”\n\nThe United States is reviving its diplomatic efforts after meetings over the summer between Ukrainian and Russian officials, and between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, produced no breakthroughs. As part of this push, the Trump administration has pressed Russia and Ukraine to present in writing terms for a settlement that could become a basis of negotiations.\n\nA delegation of senior U.S. military officials arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday for talks with Ukrainian officials about breaking the impasse.\n\nMr. Zelensky, too, is seeking to resurrect long-dormant peace talks. He met on Wednesday in Turkey, where Ukraine and Russia have engaged in previous rounds of discussions, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr. Erdogan has offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S.-Russian plan emerged from talks between Steve Witkoff, a Trump administration envoy, and a Russian counterpart, Kirill Dmitriev. A senior Ukrainian official said the Trump administration had informed Ukraine of the talks but had not sought Kyiv’s input. The terms in the plan were unacceptable to Kyiv, the official said.\n\nThe proposal would require Ukraine to surrender to Russia the entire eastern Donbas region, even lands that Russian forces have not captured, according to the Ukrainian official. At the current rate of advance, Russia would have to fight an additional four years to seize that territory, according to DeepState, a group with ties to the Ukrainian military that maps the battlefield.\n\nThe proposed settlement would also cap the size of Ukraine’s army far below its current levels and would recognize the Crimean Peninsula and other occupied areas as Russian, the senior Ukrainian official said.\n\nAnother official familiar with the proposal said Russia was demanding that foreign troops be prohibited on Ukrainian-controlled territory after a cease-fire. This would rule out a French and British proposal to deploy what has been called a reassurance force to stabilize security in postwar Ukraine.\n\nThe plan, that official said, would also require Ukraine to relinquish some long-range weapons. Ukraine now routinely fires domestically made exploding drones at targets in Russia hundreds of miles from its border, including in Moscow.\n\nThe settlement proposal is similar to one that Russia presented in talks in 2022. Moscow subsequently lost about half of the territory it had captured in the initial invasion, before recapturing some in bloody, drawn-out fighting.\n\nThis fall, the tide has turned in Russia’s favor, as its forces have menaced long-held Ukrainian positions on the battlefield. Russia is advancing in small units into a partially surrounded city in eastern Ukraine, Pokrovsk, signaling momentum. Most analysts expect the city to fall soon.\n\nThe Ukrainian Army is strained, running short of soldiers. Analysts and members of Ukraine’s Parliament say gaps of more than 600 yards have opened along some stretches of the front line. Increasingly, Ukraine is relying not on infantry in trenches but on soldiers flying exploding drones to slow the onslaught.\n\nRussia has signaled a willingness to keep up its costly, incremental advances until Ukraine acquiesces to concessions limiting its security ties to the West. Kyiv says that such concessions would reward Russian aggression and leave Ukraine weak and vulnerable, arguing that Russia would use a cessation in fighting to recoup its strength for another invasion in the future.\n\nErica L.

Clooney is the title character, a charming movie star who has stayed on Hollywood’s A-list for decades with the help of his devoted manager, Ron (Sandler). But as Jay’s youngest daughter prepares for college, the man on every billboard realizes he’s barely been there for her at all.\n\nWhen he is invited to a festival tribute in Italy just as his daughter begins a vacation abroad, Jay follows her across Europe. Accompanied by Ron, facing his own crisis of confidence, Jay must confront the sacrifices he’s made by putting his career above all else.\n\n“The universal theme of this isn’t about being a movie star,” Clooney said. “This is about pretty much everybody who works and the sacrifices you make to succeed.”\n\nStill, when I met Clooney, Sandler and Baumbach last month at the Beverly Hills Hotel, each brought a unique perspective on fame and ambition.\n\nClooney was a working TV actor before “ER” catapulted him to global stardom and a high-flying film career, while “Saturday Night Live” helped establish Sandler as a comic movie star who was among the first big names to make the leap to streaming. Even Baumbach’s profile has risen substantially after directing the Oscar-winning “Marriage Story” and co-writing “Barbie” with his partner, Greta Gerwig.\n\nFor all three, “this is something that somewhere, at a very young age, we initiated, right?” Clooney said. “We had to have the temerity to think that you could write something and get it made and people would care. It’s madness that you think it’ll work — and if it does, you’re the luckiest.”\n\nThese are edited excerpts from our conversation.\n\nWhat did you think fame would be like before you had it?\n\nGEORGE CLOONEY I’d seen it from the point of view of my aunt [the singer Rosemary Clooney]. She was a big star in Hollywood in the ’50s, then pop music changed and she was out of business. She didn’t handle it well and lost about 30 years on drugs and booze being pretty angry at life.\n\nSo I got to see fame from the when-it-doesn’t-work-out side. It’s a great lesson because you understand how little it has to do with you and that there is no success at all without massive amounts of failure. I mean, Adam, how many auditions did you go on before you got a gig?\n\nADAM SANDLER Over and over, never got hired. But it didn’t ever get in my way.\n\nCLOONEY It didn’t deter you.\n\nSANDLER Because I was young and I just was like, “All right, keep going. Go, go, go, until it happens.”\n\nCLOONEY For most people, that first “no” is devastating. The difference in what we do for a living is that the goods you’re selling is you — it’s not a set of encyclopedias. So when they say, “No thank you,” it’s personal. You have to be tough-skinned enough to say, “I’m going back in there.”\n\nAdam, what do you remember about meeting George when he hosted “S.N.L.” in 1995?\n\nSANDLER It was at the height of “ER,” and I went to a Knicks game with George. I remember feeling as invisible as I’ve ever felt. I thought I was becoming a star and I was like, “Oh, not a soul’s looking at me.” Every woman in the place was looking at him, every guy’s going, “Man, I wish I was that guy.”\n\nCLOONEY That was really fun. We’ve always kept in touch but never found a project. Then Noah called.\n\nNoah, you’ve become more famous in the last several years, too. Have you noticed that people treat you differently?\n\nNOAH BAUMBACH Yeah, you notice that. Not everybody, though.\n\nCLOONEY Never your kids.\n\nBAUMBACH They don’t know any different.\n\nHas your own experience of fame and success struck you in a way that made it into this movie?\n\nBAUMBACH I thought about this in the middle of writing it, that a lot of my movies are about people who self-identify as a failure because the lack of success, to them, has equaled failure, which is not the case. But defining yourself by your success does the same thing: It’s just another way to not look at yourself as who you might actually be. That’s definitely the case for Jay.\n\nGeorge, you’ve said you’re glad you became successful later, in your 30s. But Adam, you were hired on “S.N.L.” only two years after college. What’s that experience of early fame like?\n\nSANDLER I was excited for it. Back then, that’s all you wanted. I got on MTV when I was 18. I started walking around New York and having people say, “Hey, dude!” They didn’t always know my name.\n\nCLOONEY When was the moment they actually knew your name?\n\nSANDLER Probably the third season of “S.N.L.” When you start, you’re just one of the guys on the show. Then, all of a sudden, they say your name and you get excited.\n\nCLOONEY When I moved to L.A., my cousin Miguel was best friends with Shaun Cassidy, just off “The Hardy Boys.” He’d go, “Come on, boys, let’s go to the mall and be famous.” And you’d go and everybody would cheer and scream. I was like, “Jesus Christ, this is overwhelming.”\n\nSANDLER I was looking for that when I was young. I remember telling my parents somebody recognized me, and my father was like, “That made you feel good?” I’m like, “Yeah!”\n\nWhat’s the down side to that?\n\nSANDLER Sometimes you feel like you’re supposed to react a certain way in public because of who you’re perceived as being. So if I have a moment of not handling something right, it’s an extra-long look of, “What the hell happened? I didn’t think Adam would behave like that.”\n\nDo strangers ever say, “Tell a joke, be funny”?\n\nSANDLER I think every comedian gets that. [Chris] Farley was the best at that. Someone would get excited he was there, and they’d say some “be funny” kind of thing, and he’d be funny.\n\nCLOONEY Comedians are not known for being the happiest people when they’re not onstage.\n\nSANDLER That’s true. It’s not a guarantee you’ll get the best of us.\n\nCLOONEY I played in the comedy basketball league at the Hollywood Y. Man, it was like hate all day, laugh all night.\n\nHow much do you let the public perception of you affect your actual personality? Jay is so committed to his persona that it sometimes seems to blur into his real life.\n\nBAUMBACH The acting teacher [in the movie] says you’re acting twice if you are famous: Your job is to be an actor, and your other job is to act the part of the movie star.\n\nCLOONEY The secret is to take everything with a grain of salt. I’ve always been surrounded by people who were around when I wasn’t successful and slept on their couches. It’s helpful to have that perspective. Those are the people laughing when somebody tells you how great you are.\n\nBAUMBACH These two guys really do handle it with amazing generosity. I’ve been walking around New York with Adam and every person who walks by feels like they had a real moment with him, and we haven’t broken stride in our conversation.\n\nCLOONEY There’s certain people — Adam, Bill Murray — where there is this expectation that something really great is going to happen when they see you. I’ve been around Adam when people are like, “Hey,” and he puts them at ease. Most people try to put up a defense layer.\n\nThe movie touches on how the life of a famous person can be somewhat circumscribed. Some celebrities, like Jay, stop going out in public altogether. But Adam, it sounds like you’ve figured out how to navigate that. You’re still willing to interact with people.\n\nSANDLER I like jumping out there. Even when they say, “Do you want a car to take you to the premiere?” I always just say, “Let me drive myself.” Sometimes it gets too overwhelming, but that’s my instinct.\n\nCLOONEY I’m not as good at getting out as you are. I have a tendency to go, “If I go out, that’s going to be an extra hour of talking to people.” Paul Newman actually talked about this to me.\n\nWhen I first met him, he was at Warner Bros. doing “Message in a Bottle” and I was on “ER.” Newman was sitting outside smoking a cigarette, so I pulled up in the golf cart and was like, “Hey, just wanted to say hi.” He had no idea who I was, but everybody who came by on golf carts was like, “Hey, George.” “George!” So bit by bit, he figured out I was successful in the industry in some way.\n\nThen he goes, “George, don’t let them keep you at home.” He meant very specifically that tendency to isolate because you’re trying to hold onto some privacy. My tendency at that moment was to stay in, and hearing Newman say that, it made sense immediately.\n\nJay is so committed to the maintenance of his A-list career that it almost seems he’s operating from a place of fear. We’ve seen actors get too cautious about losing their place in the pecking order.\n\nCLOONEY But time always wins, ultimately. I did this series with Frank Langella and we were showing an old clip of him, and he looked at me and goes, “I was so beautiful.” He said you have to make peace with time, that you become more invisible as you get older.\n\nNow, some guys were never going to be invisible — I was good friends with Gregory Peck, and if you walked in a room with him, everybody would stand up. But for most of us, you have to deal with the idea of aging.\n\nBAUMBACH The movie is about time as well, and it was interesting for an American movie star to play his age because part of what we want from them is for them never to grow old. Cary Grant stopped acting because …\n\nCLOONEY … he didn’t like how he looked kissing a girl.\n\nBAUMBACH He didn’t think people wanted to see him that way. He wasn’t going to be “Cary Grant.” It was exciting for me to think about an American star like George to show something very revealing. It’s something Europeans did — Marcello Mastroianni aged and went for it — but not a lot of American actors have.\n\nJay watches a tribute reel that uses moments from George’s films. George, what kind of takeaway do you have when you watch one of those at a gala?\n\nBAUMBACH His takeaway is in the movie, because that’s him watching the reel for the first time.\n\nCLOONEY I didn’t know Noah was doing that, I was shocked. When I grab Adam’s hand, that was very real — we were both kind of tearing up. There’s that thing of, “I remember this was my big break, and this was such a failure, and this changed the trajectory of my career.” All of those things keep flooding by you.\n\nBAUMBACH Watching yourself get older, too.\n\nCLOONEY You don’t really have the perspective of aging that other people have of you. The only way that works is if you go away for a while and come back, but if you’re doing it constantly, slowly, it’s the frog in the water. It’s fascinating to sit in that room and feel it.\n\nPart of it is, you’re shocked that it’s been 40 years. Laura Dern and I did a movie together 40 years ago [“Grizzly II: Revenge”] — she was 15! But there’s also a feeling of accomplishment. There’s some shame in some things you’ve done and some pride in some things you’ve done, which is good. It should be both.\n\nVideo camera operator: Gilles O’Kane\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz91dk0l50no","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"00:23:14.958+00:00","title":"On the front line of Europe's standoff with Russia's shadow fleet","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the growing threat posed by Russia's so-called 'shadow fleet'—a network of tankers using false or invalid flags and opaque ownership to circumvent Western sanctions on Russian oil exports.

Europe's standoff with Russia's shadow fleet\n\nOut on the western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker.\n\n\"Swedish Coastguard calling… Do you consent to answer a few questions for us? Over.\"\n\nThrough heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship's insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt.\n\n\"I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,\" says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin.\n\nThis is the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\"; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports.\n\nAfter the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance.\n\nSome \"shadow\" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or \"spoofing\" their location data.\n\nOut on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating.\n\nAs the BBC has learned, a growing network of \"shadow\" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance.\n\nThat is a troubling trend, given many are practically \"floating rust buckets\", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann.  If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, \"good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost\".\n\nDriven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database.\n\nThe BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag.\n\nThe head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two.\n\nThe rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk.\n\nWhat's more, he suggests, it's brazen: \"There's no secret made about it.\"\n\nWe spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure.\n\nJourneying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction.\n\nThe BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship.\n\nTracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap.\n\nOriginally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade.\n\nBack in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea -  which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships.\n\nBy late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK.\n\nThe tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number.\n\nIn August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as \"false\". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry.\n\nThe BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called  FMTC Ship Charter LLC , but our emails and our calls went unanswered.\n\nThe beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI.\n\nOpaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection.\n\nPurged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point \"where they just don't even bother at all\", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann.\n\nUnity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it.\n\nBy 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication.\n\nThe tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties.\n\nBack in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly  detained  at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages.\n\nUnity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to  UK and EU service and port bans  as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin.\n\nNevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago.\n\nAnalysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air  finds  that \"shadow\" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself.\n\nWhile politicians  talk of toughening action , navy and coastguard officers point out that a country's power to act fades the further you go out to sea.\n\nThe right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it.\n\nCountries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event.\n\n\"There's a complexity associated with it,\" argues Commodore Ivo Värk. \"With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis.\"\n\nThe Estonians speak from experience.\n\nWhen they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has \"constantly\" had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk.\n\nThe fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken.\n\n\"Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,\" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, \"we don't want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself\".\n\n\"Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies.\"\n\nBack on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up.\n\n\"Thank you for your co-operation,\" says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia.\n\nThe exchange lasted just over five minutes.\n\n\"You need to see it in a larger perspective,\" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: \"This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.\"\n\nBut as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: \"You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.\"\n\nThere is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile \"the dark fleet is getting darker\".\n\nThe BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West's \"anti-Russian sanctions\" were \"illegitimate\" and \"undermine established principles of global commerce\".\n\n\"Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,\" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to \"easily resolved\" issues such as administrative delays.\n\nIt was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had \"heightened\" the risks by \"forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape\".\n\nAdditional reporting by Adrienne Murray, Michael Steininger and Ali Zaidi"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/well/mind/suicide-crisis-syndrome.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"11:49:43-05:00","title":"When a Person in Distress Denies Being Suicidal, Should They Be Believed?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the limitations of traditional suicide risk assessments, which often rely on patients admitting to suicidal intent — a method that fails to detect suicide risk in many cases.

Suicidal, Should They Be Believed?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-19T11:49:43-05:00\n\nIn his nearly 40-year career as a psychiatrist, Dr. Igor Galynker has lost three patients to suicide while they were under his care. None of them had told him that they intended to harm themselves.\n\nIn one case, a patient who Dr. Galynker had been treating for a year sent him a present — a porcelain caviar dish — and a letter, telling Dr. Galynker that it wasn’t his fault. It arrived one week after the man died by suicide.\n\n“That was pretty devastating,” Dr. Galynker said, adding, “It took me maybe two years to come to terms with it.”\n\nHe began to wonder: What happens in people’s minds before they kill themselves? What is the difference between that day and the day before?\n\nNobody seemed to know the answer.\n\nSuicide rates continue to rise; it is now the third leading cause of death worldwide among those 15 to 29. But despite decades of research into suicide prevention, it is still very difficult to know whether someone will try to die by suicide. The most common method of assessing suicidal risk involves asking patients directly if they plan to harm themselves. While this is an essential question, some clinicians, including Dr. Galynker, say it is inadequate for predicting imminent suicidal behavior. A better solution, they say, is to identify and treat the symptoms that lead to a suicidal state of mind: a condition they call suicide crisis syndrome, or S.C.S.\n\nDr. Galynker, the director of the Suicide Prevention Research Lab at Mount Sinai in New York City, has said that relying on mentally ill people to disclose suicidal intent is “absurd.” Some patients may not be cognizant of their own mental state, he said, while others are determined to die and don’t want to tell anyone.\n\nHe and his team have now spent more than 15 years researching S.C.S., and have submitted an application to add it to the mental health diagnostic manual used by clinicians, the D.S.M.-5, as a new diagnosis. It is a lengthy process that can take years. But Dr. Galynker says it is their best shot at getting clinicians to take S.C.S. symptoms seriously.\n\nClinicians often look for suicidal ideation and behavior when determining suicide risk. The Columbia Protocol, an evidence-based suicide risk assessment used around the world, asks patients to disclose whether they have been thinking about, intending or planning suicide. Patients receive a score of 0 — the lowest possible risk — if they deny ideation, unless they admit to either having tried or planned to end their life in the past.\n\nIt can be difficult for people to share suicidal thoughts. According to one literature review, about half of those who died by suicide had denied having suicidal intent in the week or month before ending their life.\n\nEight years ago, Dr. Fred Miller, an emergency psychiatrist in the Chicago area, was distraught when a few patients who had been treated in his department killed themselves, all within a two-month time span.\n\nThe patients had denied being suicidal during their most recent visits at NorthShore University HealthSystem, now Endeavor Health, where Dr. Miller was working as the chair of psychiatry.\n\nThe uptick in suicides could have been viewed as a statistical anomaly, a tragic consequence of severe psychiatric illness. But he didn’t see it that way.\n\n“It was a sort of déjà vu,” he said.\n\nIn 2013, several years earlier, Dr. Miller’s 24-year-old daughter Alyssa had died by suicide. He had pleaded with her psychiatrist to admit her to a hospital — she was agitated and kept “thinking about thinking.” She was also having difficulty sleeping and had become withdrawn. But Alyssa’s doctor refused to hospitalize her, partly because she had denied feeling suicidal.\n\nDays later, she was dead.\n\nSuicide crisis syndrome is considered the last of a four-stage mental progression toward suicide that often begins with ongoing problems like alcoholism and the lingering effects of childhood trauma. When these issues are combined with character traits like perfectionism or impulsivity as well as stressful life events and thoughts of being a failure and a burden, it creates a perfect storm.\n\nTo be diagnosed with S.C.S., Dr. Galynker said, patients must have a “persistent and intense feeling of frantic hopelessness,” in which they feel trapped in an intolerable situation.\n\nThey must also have emotional distress, which can include intense anxiety; feelings of being extremely tense, keyed up or jittery (people often develop insomnia); recent social withdrawal; and difficulty controlling their thoughts.\n\nBy the time patients develop S.C.S., they are in such distress that the thinking part of the brain — the frontal lobe — is overwhelmed, said Lisa J. Cohen, the supervising psychologist at Mount Sinai Beth Israel who is studying S.C.S. alongside Dr. Galynker. It’s like “trying to concentrate on a task with a fire alarm going off and dogs barking all around you,” she added.\n\nAlthough S.C.S. is not yet an official diagnosis, the syndrome is being used to assess suicidality in select health centers in the United States as well as in other countries, including Israel and Norway.\n\nDr. Miller, the psychiatrist at Endeavor Health in Chicago, first learned about S.C.S. after the patient suicides. He then led efforts to screen every psychiatric patient for S.C.S. at his hospital system. In trying to implement the screenings there have been “fits and starts,” he said.\n\n“It’s like turning the Titanic,” he added. “There are so many stakeholders that need to see that a new approach is worth the time and effort.”\n\nUltimately, based on results from a sampling of practitioners from Dr. Miller’s hospital system and other institutions, the clinicians reported that S.C.S. was useful in assessing near-term suicide risk. And in 2024, Dr. Miller and his collaborators published a study showing that when E.R. patients were diagnosed with S.C.S., and admitted to the hospital with moderate to severe suicidal ideation, they were about 75 percent less likely to be readmitted to the hospital than patients with the same level of suicidal ideation who did not have S.C.S.\n\nThe results suggested that those with S.C.S. benefited from “immediate, high-intensity treatment,” Dr. Miller said.\n\nMarisa Russello, 39, first learned about S.C.S. several years ago while working as a consultant in Dr. Galynker’s lab, four years after she tried to take her life.\n\nThe syndrome “really put my experience into words,” she said.\n\nOn the night that she nearly died, Ms. Russello wasn’t initially planning to harm herself. Life had been stressful, she said. She felt overwhelmed at work. A new antidepressant wasn’t working. She and her husband were arguing more than usual. But she wasn’t suicidal.\n\nShe was at the movies with her husband when Ms. Russello began to feel nauseated and agitated. She said she had a headache and needed to go home. As she reached the subway, a wave negative emotions washed over her.\n\n“I feel like my husband is going to divorce me,” she thought. “I’m too much for him. I can’t go on without him.”\n\nBy the time she got home, she had “dropped into this black hole of sadness.”\n\nAnd she decided that she had no choice but to end her life. Fortunately, she said, her attempt was interrupted.\n\nHer decision to die by suicide was so sudden that if her psychiatrist had asked about self-harm at their last session, she would have said, truthfully, that she wasn’t even considering it.\n\nNow, she said, when she finds herself entering the same state of mind — restless, ruminative, hopeless — Ms. Russello seeks help right away by confiding in her husband.\n\n“It’s important that people, even lay people, recognize what this is,” she said.\n\nDr. Paul S. Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University who has reviewed proposed additions to the D.S.M.-5., wonders whether diagnosing patients with S.C.S. could have a “stigmatizing effect.”\n\n“What does that do to your insurability?” Dr. Appelbaum asked. Is it something you’d have to reveal when you apply for a professional license? Should people be diagnosed if they deny suicidal intent and insist that they don’t plan to harm themselves?\n\nDr. Appelbaum also questioned whether S.C.S. was truly a mental disorder, asking whether it could be better described as “a set of circumstances and symptoms” that help predict suicidal behavior.\n\nThe latest evidence, much of which has been funded by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention points toward S.C.S. as a unique syndrome, Dr. Galynker said. But he and his colleagues have not yet obtained the funding for the gold standard in research: a large randomized controlled trial.\n\nFor Dr. Galynker and his collaborators, there is an urgent need to more accurately identify and treat the people who are most at risk of ending their lives.\n\n“You don’t come to the emergency room with crushing chest pain and just wait,” Dr. Miller said. “You have to treat that.”\n\nThe same should be true of the suicidal state of mind, he added.\n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/world/middleeast/israeli-strikes-gaza-deaths.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:41:11-05:00","title":"Israeli Strikes Kill at Least 25 in Gaza Amid Truce, Officials Say","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 19, 2025, Israel launched a series of airstrikes in Gaza, killing at least 25 people, thereby breaking a six-week truce brokered by the Trump administration, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey.

series of strikes on Gaza on Wednesday, killing at least 25 people, according to the local health ministry, and piercing a cease-fire in the territory that has mostly held for the past six weeks.\n\nThe truce between Israel and Hamas has been punctuated by occasional eruptions of deadly violence. Both sides have said, however, that they are still committed to maintaining the cease-fire.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli military said several militants had opened fire on its forces near the southern city of Khan Younis in Gaza without causing injuries. In response, Israeli forces were “striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip,” the military’s statement said.\n\nHamas said Israel’s assertion that its troops had been targeted was a “transparent attempt to justify its ongoing crimes.” The Palestinian militant group called on the United States to rein in Israeli military actions.\n\nGaza’s Civil Defense emergency workers said they had recovered 10 bodies after an Israeli strike on a building in Gaza City, in the north. Another woman was killed and two others were wounded in a strike in southern Gaza, according to he agency.\n\nAfter more than two years of devastating war, Israel and Hamas agreed to a truce in mid-October that had been brokered by the Trump administration, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. But the cease-fire did not decisively end the war, and sporadic violence has erupted several times since the agreement was signed.\n\nAs part of the deal, Hamas turned over the remaining hostages it had held in Gaza in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a new withdrawal line that left them in control of about half of the enclave.\n\nThe Trump administration, along with other mediators, is trying to move ahead with the next steps in President Trump’s ambitious vision for peace in Gaza. That includes Hamas laying down its weapons, the deployment of an international security force and a full Israeli withdrawal.\n\nBut many observers fear the cease-fire could fall apart long before it ever reaches that stage.\n\nIsraeli forces have come under fire multiple times since mid-October, killing at least three soldiers. Blaming Hamas for the attacks, Israel has responded with great force, killing more than 280 Palestinians since the truce went into effect, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The ministry’s toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.\n\nIn late October, Israeli forces killed at least 100 people across Gaza, including children, in a single night of strikes, according to Palestinian health officials. Israeli officials said they had been responding to an attack that killed an Israeli soldier, as well as Hamas’s failure to promptly hand over the remaining bodies of hostages still believed to be in Gaza.\n\nSince the cease-fire came into effect, Israeli forces have also attacked Gazans that the military said had crossed the line that now divides the territory, in violation of the agreement. One attack struck a civilian vehicle carrying several members of an extended family.\n\nAt least nine people were killed in that strike, including several children, according to relatives. The Israeli military confirmed firing on the car, saying the driver had ignored warning fire and crossed the cease-fire line.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/opinion/saudi-mbs-trump-khashoggi.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"16:15:23-05:00","title":"Trump’s Fawning Meeting With the Saudi Prince Was a Disgrace","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article criticizes President Donald Trump for conducting a fawning, inappropriate meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, where he downplayed the crown prince’s involvement in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, despite credible evidence from the CIA and UN indicating the prince's likely responsibility.

Defeating foreign threats often requires the help of countries that fall far short of being liberal democracies that respect human rights. Saudi Arabia is a classic example of such a country today. It both has a disturbing human rights record and is a legitimately valuable American partner in countering Iran’s aggressions and building a more stable Middle East.\n\nBut working with imperfect partners does not mean that the United States should cover up and lie about their misdeeds, as President Trump did when receiving Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, in the Oval Office on Tuesday. It was a fawning, cringe-worthy performance that belied America’s more powerful status. It was absolution rather than realpolitik.\n\nMr. Trump embraced the prince’s implausible claim of innocence in the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and journalist, and berated Mary Bruce, of ABC News, for asking about the killing. The C.I.A. has concluded that the crown prince almost certainly ordered the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a critic of the prince who was living in self-imposed exile in the United States and was murdered while visiting a Saudi consulate in Turkey. A United Nations investigator and a coalition of nongovernmental organizations reached similar conclusions.\n\nThese inquiries noted that Saudi officials offered conflicting accounts of the killing and concealed information about it. Eventually, the kingdom investigated several members of Prince Mohammed’s inner circle for the killing.\n\nThe president’s performance was alarming for three main reasons. One, it suggested that the truth was irrelevant, and it discarded the hard work of American intelligence in trying to determine that truth. It continued a long pattern of Mr. Trump lying when it suits his interests.\n\nTwo, he whitewashed a brutal human-rights violation — a killing by strangulation, followed by the dismembering and disposal of the body, committed by a team of Saudi operatives. The United States does not have the power to rid the world of human-rights abuses. At its best, though, this country has successfully nudged allies toward better behavior. Mr. Trump, by contrast, signaled this week that foreign despots can eliminate bothersome critics without worry of American disapproval.\n\nThree, the president showed open disdain for the principles of press freedom enshrined in the Constitution. Traditionally, foreign leaders who visit the White House understand that they will not be able to avoid hard questions, as authoritarian leaders can at home. Ms. Bruce, the ABC correspondent, lived up to this tradition with a two-part question about the Trump family’s business dealings in Saudi Arabia and the prince’s role in Mr. Khashoggi’s killing.\n\nMr. Trump unpersuasively waved away his conflicts of interest before demeaning Mr. Khashoggi — “a lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about” — and defending Prince Mohammed. “He knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,” Mr. Trump said. “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.”\n\nThe role of the news media in our democracy is not to flatter foreign leaders or, for that matter, American ones. It is to pose important and sometimes challenging questions and publish the facts. As president, Mr. Trump repeatedly shows contempt for this principle. Over the past week alone, he called Ms. Bruce “a terrible person” and told another female reporter, “Quiet, piggy.” His behavior suggests that he would prefer an American news media that behaves more like Saudi Arabia’s largely muzzled and obsequious media.\n\nThe prince is a complicated dictator. He has pushed his country to become more modern and open in important ways, including by expanding women’s rights, reducing the influence of religious hard-liners and diversifying the economy. He also remains an authoritarian. In addition to evidently masterminding the savage killing of Mr. Khashoggi, he regularly jails critics and has overseen a sharp increase in executions for low-level drug offenses. The appropriate role for the United States is to make him uncomfortable about his abuses and push Saudi Arabia toward a freer future.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Lorrie, who was 15 at the time and his eldest daughter, raced to him on the tarmac in a moment immortalized by a photojournalist: Grinning ecstatically, she had her arms outstretched for a hug, and her feet were off the ground as if levitating.\n\n“It was like when you’re a little kid, and Santa is going to be coming, and you know it’s going to be amazing but you don’t know how amazing it’s going to be,” Ms. Stirm Kitching, now 68, said in an interview.\n\nHer sister and two brothers also hurried toward their father, smiling, as did their mother, Loretta, who wore a large corsage for the occasion.\n\nSlava Veder, an Associated Press photographer known as Sal, was on assignment to cover the reunions and rushed to a makeshift darkroom inside a women’s bathroom on the base after rival photographers from United Press International took the men’s bathroom.\n\n“It was a hell of a moment and, in that moment, you are grabbed,” said Mr. Veder, who is now 99. “It was overwhelming.”\n\nHis published photograph, titled “Burst of Joy,” appeared in newspapers across the country and was awarded the 1974 Pulitzer Prize for feature photography. Lt. Col. Stirm, dressed in his military uniform, back to the camera, face unseen, served as a representative of every serviceman who returned to loved ones from Vietnam, Mr. Veder told Smithsonian magazine in 2005.\n\nDonald M. Goldstein, a co-author of “The Vietnam War: The Story and Photographs” (1997), described the moment to the magazine as “a hero’s welcome for guys who weren’t always seen or treated as heroes.” After a lost war that “tore us apart,” Mr. Goldstein said, “it was finally over, and the country could start healing.”\n\nFor Colonel Stirm, the joyous homecoming captured on camera obscured the agonizing reality he had braced for on the flight home: the dissolution of his marriage.\n\nHis will to survive as a P.O.W., he later said, was built on memories of his domestic life and the hope of returning one day to his family. Those thoughts sustained him after he was shot down and was forced to eject from his F-105 Thunderchief during a bombing mission over North Vietnam on Oct. 27, 1967, and they continued to sustain him in prison camps, including the notorious “Hanoi Hilton,” where he was starved, tortured and subjected to mock executions.\n\nHe held the rank of major at the time he was taken prisoner and was eventually elevated to colonel. He was among 591 American prisoners of war released as part of Operation Homecoming after the Paris Peace Accords ended the United States involvement in the Vietnam War. Three days before he landed at Travis Air Force Base, he was handed what he described as a “Dear John” letter from his wife.\n\n“I have changed drastically — forced into a situation where I finally had to grow up,” his wife of 18 years wrote. “Bob, I feel sure that in your heart you know we can’t make it together — and it doesn’t make sense to be unhappy when you can do something about it. Life is too short.”\n\n“I love you — we all love you,” she continued, “but you must remember how very unhappy we were together.”\n\nMs. Stirm Kitching said her mother acknowledged in the letter of having an affair during her husband’s captivity that ended before his return.\n\n“She was a really great mother,” Ms. Stirm Kitching added, recalling that she led the family in nightly prayers for Colonel Stirm’s safe return and kept his memory alive for the children by explaining, when asked, the date and place and circumstance of each photograph of him that hung on a wall in the family room.\n\nThe affair, Ms. Stirm Kitching said, was a “sad, unfortunate thing.”\n\n“She met somebody who pursued her and called her and sent her flowers,” she said. “She was feeling like, ‘Oh gosh, I’ve been this mom, just taking care of my kids, making sure they’re good and growing up well, and then somebody wants to pay attention to me.’”\n\nDespite the painful letter to her husband, Loretta Stirm offered to try to make her marriage work, her daughter said.\n\nColonel Stirm later told The Associated Press that he had found it impossible to forgive his wife for the affair. Days after a bitter divorce in 1974 that made the news, both remarried. Colonel Stirm kept several copies of the picture autographed by Mr. Veder but, while his children displayed them, he did not.\n\nRobert Lewis Stirm was born on March 22, 1933, in San Francisco and grew up in Hillsborough, Calif. His father, H. Glenn Stirm, owned a steel-fabrication business. His mother, Virginia (Lewis) Stirm, ran the household.\n\nHe joined the Air Force aviation cadet program in 1953, graduated from the University of Colorado in 1954 with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and earned his pilot wings in 1959. After numerous postings and advanced training, he served as an F-105 pilot with the 333rd Tactical Fighter Squadron at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force in Thailand from August 1967 until he was shot down that October.\n\nHe said little about Vietnam after returning home, Ms. Stirm Kitching said, but he told a story about a fellow P.O.W., John S. McCain, the Navy pilot and future U.S. senator, who told a joke by tapping on the wall in code to Colonel Stirm in an adjacent cell. “My Dad said it was the first time he laughed in jail,” she said, adding, “I wish I knew the joke.”\n\nColonel Stirm retired from the Air Force in 1977 and worked as a corporate pilot and in the family steel-fabrication business. His military decorations included three awards of the Silver Star as well as two awards of the Legion of Merit and the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nHis marriages to Loretta Mrosko and Nancy Smith ended in divorce.\n\nIn addition to his daughter Lorrie, he is survived by two other children, Cynthia Pierson and Roger Stirm; three sisters, Virginia Hall, Marjorie Stirm and Nancy Stirm Bronstein; a brother, John Stirm; nine grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. His son Dr. Robert “Bo” Stirm Jr., a dentist, died in 2023.\n\nIn 2005, Ms. Stirm Kitching told Smithsonian that when she looked at the Pulitzer-winning photograph, she felt fortunate because many families had not been reunited during or after the Vietnam War.\n\nToday, she said, she feels “joy and happiness” when seeing herself, always running to hug her father, whom she called her hero. She keeps the photo in the foyer of her home near San Francisco. When guests arrive, she said, she likes to tell them, “This is my way to welcome you; I’m so happy you’re here.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/climate/electic-vehicle-chargers-north-dakota.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:59:02-05:00","title":"Driving an E.V.

Across North Dakota? Thank the Standing Rock Tribe.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-18T20:59:02-05:00\n\nThis summer, Len Necefer finally planned the road trip he’s been thinking about for nearly a decade: Going coast-to-coast in an electric vehicle, stopping only to charge on tribal lands.\n\nAs a Navajo citizen and tribal energy expert who used to work in the federal government, he saw it as the ultimate test of how far energy infrastructure had come.\n\nStop by stop, his plans came together until North Dakota, where a dearth of chargers seemed to prevent a Midwest crossing. Then, he spotted it: a level-2 charger at Sitting Bull College on the Standing Rock Reservation.\n\n50 States, 50 Fixes is a series about local solutions to environmental problems. A few more to come this year.\n\nIt was more than a lucky break. Over the past three years, Standing Rock has installed chargers across the reservation as part of the Electric Nation project, a regional effort to create an intertribal charging network.\n\nBy the time the project wraps at the end of November, Standing Rock Nation will operate 13 E.V. chargers, most of them in North Dakota. While there aren’t many E.V.s in town yet, each new charger makes driving one easier than before.\n\n“I want to show folks that this technology is not out of our affordable reach, but that it is here for us to use,” said Joseph McNeil, the chief executive of SAGE, a clean energy organization owned by the tribe that is spearheading the project.\n\nThe Standing Rock Reservation, home to the Lakota and Dakota peoples, is rural and spread out, straddling the border between North and South Dakota. The cost of gas aggravates the reservation’s high poverty rates. With the closest commercial centers at least an hour away, access to reliable transportation is a measure of well being.\n\n“Our economic situation shouldn’t dictate our access to sustainability,” Mr. McNeil said. He wants every SAGE project to create jobs or revenue for the tribe. Institutions that are hosting the E.V. chargers, like the college, will eventually take ownership of them and collect any revenue.\n\nSAGE’s project director, Fawn Wasin Zi, said E.V.s were part of a longstanding push for clean energy on the reservation. In 2016, the tribe was in the midst of planning a wind farm when protests to block the Dakota Access Pipeline engulfed the reservation. Their fight against a plan to transport oil over their sacred lands was recognized with an award from the Wallace Global Fund, which came with a $250,000 prize and a $1 million investment earmarked for the ongoing wind farm project.\n\nThe tribe may be widely known for the anti-pipeline movement, Ms. Wasin Zi said, “but there’s so much more going on.” She was managing the wind project at the time and used the prize to start SAGE. “The traditional way is to live with Unci Maka, Grandmother Earth, not against her,” she said.\n\nThe pipeline also helped inspire the regional E.V. project.\n\n“As I was protesting, I thought, ‘What if we connected all the tribes in an electric vehicle charging network?’” said Robert Blake, a solar energy developer in Minneapolis. “It would be another form of resistance against fossil fuel infrastructure.” A few years later, Mr. Blake formed Native Sun, a nonprofit group dedicated to renewable energy outreach in tribal nations.\n\nIn 2021, Native Sun and SAGE teamed up and jointly won a $6 million Department of Energy grant to create Electric Nation. More funders followed, and the project took off.\n\nToday, eight chargers have been installed at key locations around Standing Rock including local schools, a tribal administration building, Sitting Bull College and two casinos. Four more, coming later this month, will mark the completion of the project.\n\nThere’s even more in Red Lake Nation, where Mr. Blake is from. He has heard from other tribes in different parts of the country who now want to recreate Electric Nation on their lands. The network is a crucial first step in helping residents see gas-free cars as a viable, climate-friendly option.\n\nSAGE has also used grant funding to give six electric vehicles to various institutions across the reservation.\n\nThese vehicles are improving daily life in small but meaningful ways. Sitting Bull College’s facilities director, Scott Gates, now uses a Ford Lightning E.V. to haul equipment and rescue cars stuck in the snow. Leo Red Horse, a clerk at the tribe’s administrative offices, takes an electric shuttle, provided by Standing Rock Public Transit, to work most mornings. Four teachers share a ride to the local elementary school in a Chevy Blazer, which is often plugged in to the school’s solar-powered chargers.\n\nIn November, Standing Rock Public Transit added a new electric van to its fleet, with a longer driving range than the first. It will take riders as far as Bismarck, N.D., the nearest commercial hub, an hour away. The school district also has plans to purchase several more electric vehicles for teacher car pools, along with some electric school buses.\n\nSAGE hopes to eventually place a community-shared E.V. and charger in each of the reservation’s eight districts. In a place with a 40 percent poverty rate, free access to an E.V. matters. Even though electric cars typically cost less than gas ones over the lifetime of the vehicle, the initial purchase does not.\n\nThere’s also broad concern about how the cars will fare in the region’s harsh winters. Cold weather, combined with energy needed to heat the car, can affect battery efficiency and cause an E.V.’s range to drop by up to 30 percent.\n\nClimate-friendly choices often have to take a back seat in light of the struggles many people on the reservation face daily, like affording food for the next day, said Steve Sitting Bear, the tribe’s recently elected chairman.\n\nBut, “inherently, as tribal members, we don’t like to see the destruction of the environment, of our land, the poisoning of our water,” he said. “I want us to be a self-sufficient, sovereign nation leading the way, whether that’s with wind or solar.”\n\nToday, SAGE’s small team is juggling several projects alongside building out the electric vehicle network, including the ongoing wind farm development and a community solar project.\n\nOwing to the complexities of tribal treaties and land ownership, these projects tend to face more red tape than others like them. And a new grant for Electric Nation 2, set to begin expanding the charging network to new areas soon, was recently canceled by the Trump administration as part of a broader push to undo renewable energy projects.\n\n“I just hope that one day our tribe can be self sustaining,” said Wilberta Red Tomahawk, chairwoman of the SAGE board. “That means making this E.V. project bigger and bigger.”\n\nIn the coming months, Mr. Necefer, the energy expert, plans to undertake his long-awaited road trip. His stop in Standing Rock is proof that tribes will continue to pursue clean energy, even if state and federal governments won’t, he said.\n\n“Even though tribes have been skipped over and underfunded,” he said, “They’ve become a keystone to filling in infrastructure gaps in rural America.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/science/comet-3i-atlas-nasa-mars.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:44:10-05:00","title":"NASA Releases Images of Comet 3I/ATLAS: It ‘Doesn’t Look Like a Spacecraft’","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NASA released newly captured images of Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object that passed near Mars in early October 2025.

photographs of a comet do not typically fuel conspiracy theories of an imminent alien invasion.\n\nBut this is not quite an ordinary comet; 3I/ATLAS came from beyond the solar system and is now on its way back out to the empty interstellar reaches of the Milky Way. The federal government’s recent 43-day-long shutdown added to the intrigue.\n\nSpacecraft near Mars, including NASA’s, pointed their cameras at 3I/ATLAS when it zoomed past the red planet in early October. But during the U.S. government shutdown, the images from the NASA spacecraft remained out of sight. Space agency officials did not even acknowledge that the pictures existed.\n\nNASA finally put them out on Wednesday, for all the world to see.\n\n“I’d like to address the rumors right at the beginning.” Amit Kshatriya, the associate administrator of NASA, said during the news conference. “This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet.”\n\nHe and other NASA officials presented a series of images taken by the fleet of spacecraft, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Lucy mission, which is headed for fly-bys of asteroids trapped in Jupiter’s orbit, and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory.\n\n“It’s a little bit as if our NASA spacecraft were at a baseball game watching the game from different places in the stadium,” said Tom Statler, the lead scientist at NASA for solar system small bodies. “Everybody’s got a camera, and they’re trying to get a picture of the ball, and nobody has a perfect view, and everybody has a different camera.”\n\nThe image taken by Lucy shows a backlit comet. “We could not get this view from the vantage point of the Earth,” Dr. Statler said. The various views from different spacecraft and ground-based telescopes could allow scientists to assemble a three-dimensional view, he said.\n\nMeasurements of the comet show that it is unusual in some ways compared with those that formed within the solar system. But none of those quirks would indicate it was something sent by an alien civilization.\n\n“We haven’t seen any technosignatures,” said Nicola Fox, the associate administrator for NASA’s science mission directorate, using the word preferred by scientists to describe potential extraterrestrial technology.\n\nDr. Statler said 3I/ATLAS had notable differences from solar system comets, among them the ratio of carbon dioxide to water and the ratio of nickel to iron. The light reflected off dust shed by the comet was “unusual,” he said, indicating that the distribution of dust grains according to size might be different.\n\nBut, he added, the differences were like what a drinker of Hawaiian Kona coffee might notice when trying a brew from a different part of the world for the first time. “It’s different, and yet it’s still coffee,” he said.\n\nThe high-resolution camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured a relatively close-up view, from just 19 million miles away. But that camera is designed for taking photographs of the bright surface of Mars. The image it made shows a bright center and a cloud of gas and dust, known as a coma.\n\n“It’s a smeared image,” Alfred McEwen, a professor of planetary geology at the University of Arizona and until recently the principal investigator for the camera, said in an interview. “The spacecraft is designed to be stable over 10 milliseconds for imaging Mars, but this is like a three-second exposure.”\n\nBecause of the smearing, it will probably not provide better estimates of the size of the comet nucleus. In July, scientists using the Hubble Space Telescope said the comet was no wider than 3.5 miles in diameter and possibly even as small as 1,400 feet. At the time, the comet was more than 270 million miles from Earth, and Hubble.\n\nWhile the new image could yield information, Dr. McEwen said, “there’s nothing obvious that jumps out.”\n\nHe added, “It definitely looks like a comet. Yes, it’s fuzzy. It’s got a coma. Doesn’t look like a spacecraft.”\n\nThe comet was first spotted in July by telescopes on Earth. Last month, it made its closest approach to the sun, passing just inside the orbit of Mars. Scientists know it must have arrived from interstellar space because of its high speed, reaching more than 150,000 miles per hour. It is now on its way out from the solar system.\n\nAvi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard, has provoked wider interest about Comet 3I/ATLAS. He has speculated that it could have been sent by aliens, given some of its peculiarities.\n\nDr. Kshatriya said he thought the attention was wonderful. “It expanded people’s brains to think about how magical the universe could be,” he said.\n\nHe noted just a few months ago that NASA scientists had presented results about an intriguing rock on Mars that could include signs of past life.\n\nThe comet was out of view from Earth for a couple of months because it was on the other side of the sun.\n\n“Getting data at a time when none of the ground-based telescopes can observe it is very valuable,” Karen Meech, a planetary astronomer at the University of Hawaii, wrote in an email. “This includes estimates of the brightness and getting estimates of the amount of gas coming off the comet.”\n\nShe noted measurements of hydrogen emissions made by MAVEN, another NASA spacecraft orbiting Mars. Hydrogen is produced by sunlight breaking apart water molecules, and the brightness of the emissions “will ultimately tell us how much water was coming off the comet,” Dr. Meech said.\n\nThere are more observations yet to be made. The comet will come closest to Earth on Dec. 19, when it will be some 170 million miles away. Next spring it will pass by Jupiter, and NASA’s Juno spacecraft in orbit there can take a look.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/business/saudi-investment-forum-kennedy-center.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"21:19:14-05:00","title":"Saudi Arabia, Once Shunned, Has Corporate Titans Swooning for Deals","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details a dramatic shift in U.S.-Saudi business relations, moving from years of secretive and tense interactions following the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi to a bold, public, and high-profile era of economic collaboration.

But those visits were sometimes done stealthily and often with little fanfare, particularly after agents of the kingdom killed Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and Saudi critic, in 2018.\n\nBut on Wednesday, some of America’s most prominent executives strolled the red-carpeted interior of the Kennedy Center in Washington reveling in all things Saudi.\n\nAt an event billed as the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, the corporate leaders mingling and applauding speeches by President Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman included Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce; Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia; Dina Powell, the vice chair of BDT & MSD Partners and a former Goldman Sachs executive; and Alex Karp, the chief executive of Palantir.\n\nFor many, the reasons they came to the event were simple.\n\n“We can do deals here.” John Kelly, the chief technology officer of Global AI, said. “We can develop partnerships. Like, real quick, very fast, in the course of two days — dinner, breakfast meetings, side meetings.”\n\nMr. Kelly summed up the underpinnings of the transactional flurry: Saudi Arabia “needs this technology, and we need energy, and we need our technology to go beyond the United States.” That dynamic has made Nvidia, which makes powerful computer chips that are essential to A.I. projects, a powerful lever in global negotiations.\n\nElon Musk announced from the stage with Mr. Huang that his xAI, which makes the Grok chatbot, and Nvidia would team up with the state-backed Saudi company Humain to build a data center in the kingdom. The center is expected to consume as much as 500 megawatts of electricity.\n\n“You’ve done such a good job,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Huang on Wednesday as he asked the executive to stand for the room to applaud. Executives who could not fit in the Kennedy Center auditorium watched the president on screens in the lobby.\n\nThe Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia said in a release on Wednesday that the kingdom and the United States had pledged than $575 billion in deals and agreements — though that does not mean those deals will necessarily come to fruition.\n\nAmong the announcements, Blackstone’s chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, said from the stage that his private equity firm had agreed to develop a data center in Saudi Arabia with Humain. Humain also struck deals with Global AI, AMD and Cisco.\n\nMr. Trump had made it clear at a White House news conference on Tuesday that Mr. Khashoggi’s murder was not a concern, and he chided a reporter for asking Prince Mohammed about it. U.S. intelligence agencies have said the killing was carried out on the prince’s orders.\n\nThe Saudi minister of investment, Khalid al-Falih, said in an interview on the sideline of the Kennedy Center event that it and the state dinner honoring Prince Muhammad on Tuesday revealed that the U.S.-Saudi relationship “is rising to new levels.” It is one, he said, that is also being “illustrated openly.”\n\nMr. Trump’s family has its own business ties to the kingdom. Among them: The Saudi sovereign wealth fund is the lead investor, alongside Mr. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, in a $55 billion deal for the video game company Electronic Arts.\n\nThe shift from hushed deals to boldly pledged allegiances was underlined by the attendees at the White House dinner on Tuesday. Mingling alongside Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and the soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo was David Ellison, the new chief executive of Paramount Global.\n\nMr. Ellison is working on a bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal that would create a media colossus and a giant in the news industry combining CNN and CBS News. That bid is fully backstopped by his father, Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle — but the Saudis could ultimately participate in the deal.\n\nA photo from the black-tie dinner featured David Ellison with Salesforce’s Mr. Benioff and the investor Michael Dell. On Wednesday, Mr. Benioff posted the photo on social media with the message, “The enterprise software guys are in the house.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/us/cherfilus-mccormick-fema-florida-indictment.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:57:56-05:00","title":"Florida Lawmaker Stole FEMA Funds for House Campaign, Prosecutors Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Democratic congresswoman from Florida, has been charged with stealing $5 million in FEMA disaster funds and using it to support her congressional campaign.

confirmed on Wednesday that the entertainment company had purchased the gold toilet, describing it as “one of the wildest acquisitions in its history.”\n\n“It is now the most valuable and certainly the shiniest exhibit ever to join the Ripley’s collection,” the spokeswoman, Suzanne Smagala-Potts, said in a statement. “Melt it down, and the gold alone would fetch about $10 million at today’s rate, which makes this perhaps the most tempting bathroom break in art history.”\n\nRipley’s has dozens of attractions worldwide, putting its own spin on aquariums, museums and mirror mazes. It has not said where the toilet will end up, though its intention is to display it. The company is even exploring, it said, “whether visitors may someday be allowed to use it.”\n\nSotheby’s, the auction house that ran Tuesday’s sale, had priced the artwork based on the equivalent value of gold. Ripley’s paid that, and another $2 million in premiums to Sotheby’s.\n\nThe artwork, titled “America,” was made in 2016 by the conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, who fabricated two versions of the sculpture. Thieves stole and destroyed one in 2019 when it was exhibited at Blenheim Palace in England. The version bought by Ripley’s was previously owned by Steve Cohen, a financier who owns the New York Mets.\n\nCohen maintains a large art collection that is said to include other works of dark humor or political commentary, such as Jasper Johns’s 1958 “Flag” painting and Damien Hirst’s “The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,” from 1991, which involves a tiger shark preserved in formaldehyde.\n\nThe amount that Cohen paid for his toilet, which he bought in 2017, was not disclosed. When the version of the toilet on display at Blenheim Palace was stolen two years later, its worth was estimated at $5.9 million.\n\n“Finding the unbelievable is our business,” John Corcoran, Ripley’s director of exhibits, said in a statement. “But even we never imagined we would one day need a plumber on standby for an art installation.”\n\n“Our No. 1 idea is to keep things free-flowing,” he added. “No. 2 is making sure nothing gets clogged up and flushes away future possibilities.

Chips\n\nPublished: 2025-11-19T17:43:09-05:00\n\nNvidia, which has become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company by dominating the market for computer chips used in artificial intelligence projects, announced its most recent earnings this afternoon. Its business is still rapidly growing.\n\nThe company said that in its most recent quarter, profit was $31.9 billion, up 65 percent from a year ago and 245 percent from the year before that. Such eye-popping results could be enough to calm nerves on Wall Street, where there have been increasing concerns that the A.I. craze is a bubble.\n\nNvidia’s financial performance has been considered something of a bellwether for the rest of the tech industry, which is investing trillions of dollars in A.I. data centers. It controls about 90 percent of the market for A.I. chips.\n\nNvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, has also become close with President Trump this year. The Trump administration has even used the company’s chips as a tool in trade and peace talks.\n\nIn other economic news:\n\nTrump’s sweeping tariffs took a toll on trade in August, new data showed. Imports of goods and services dropped 5.1 percent from the month prior.\n\nThe Fed was divided over how quickly to lower interest rates, according to notes from last month’s meeting. The December rate cut is in doubt.\n\nLindsey Halligan — the lawyer who was handpicked by Trump to prosecute James Comey, the former F.B.I. director — told a federal judge today that she had never shown the final version of the indictment of Comey to a full grand jury.\n\nThe admission seemed to stun the judge, who grilled Halligan and one of her subordinates about irregularities in the case, which is the first criminal case of Halligan’s career. Grand jurors have to vote on indictments to approve them, and the development could give the courts reason to dismiss the case.\n\nIn other Trump administration news:\n\nThe president is expected to soon sign a bill demanding that the Justice Department release its files on Jeffrey Epstein. But there are loopholes that could mean that not all of the files may be released.\n\nTrump’s advisers recommended that FEMA be reformed but preserved, rejecting his suggestion that it dissolve.\n\nThe administration proposed weakening the Endangered Species Act.\n\nOver the past two weeks, anticorruption investigators in Ukraine have slowly unfurled details in an investigation that poses the most significant threat to President Volodymyr Zelensky’s power since Russia’s invasion in 2022.\n\nMembers of the president’s inner circle are accused of siphoning off and laundering $100 million from the state-owned nuclear power company. And an anti-Zelensky political coalition is beginning to coalesce, threatening his control over his party. Here’s what we know about the investigation.\n\nAt the same time: Today, at least 25 people were killed and some 73 wounded when a Russian missile hit an apartment building in western Ukraine. The strikes came while Zelensky was in Turkey making a push to revive peace talks.\n\nAs Gen-Z upends generations of secularization in the U.S., the ancient tradition of Orthodox Christianity is attracting waves of new adherents. Many are conservative young men who say they are drawn to Orthodoxy because they see it as a more demanding, even difficult, practice of Christianity. The surge has been fueled in part by online influencers who highlight the ways Orthodoxy affirms their masculinity.\n\n“In the whole history of the Orthodox Church in America, this has never been seen,” one priest said.\n\nFor more: Two of our religion reporters discussed how they cover Christianity.\n\nMiddle East: Israeli strikes killed at least 25 people in Gaza, local officials said. The Israeli military said the strikes were a response to Palestinian militants firing on its forces.\n\nMedicine: A new gene-editing strategy that focuses on “nonsense mutations” could create a standardized method to use for many diseases.\n\nHealth: This could be a harsh flu season in the U.S., with a virus that causes more severe symptoms than last year’s and seems to be spreading more rapidly and earlier than usual.\n\nImmigration: A Times poll found that 60 percent of immigrants support Trump’s border efforts but fewer support his raids, which are causing noncitizens to curtail their lives.\n\nF.B.I.: A former agent-in-training sued the agency, claiming that he was illegally fired for displaying a pride flag at his desk.\n\nHousing: New research shared with The Times found that home insurance prices have spiked as global reinsurance companies experience a “climate epiphany.”\n\nDrugs: In a makeshift bar on a college campus, researchers found that smoking cannabis could lead to less drinking.\n\nCheese: Climate change is stressing Italy’s cows, which could lead to a “milk apocalypse.”\n\nNew York City: Scaffolding is ubiquitous in the city. Officials unveiled six new designs to make it less unpleasant.\n\nMany artists find that movies about the art world often miss the mark. They can be too melodramatic or too didactic or just plain unrealistic. So my colleagues at T Magazine asked 10 artists and dealers to each pick out a movie that accurately captures their world.\n\nSee their choices, which include Kelly Reichardt’s 2022 quiet comedy-drama “Showing Up” and Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1966 biopic “Andrei Rublev.”\n\nThanksgiving is a pie holiday. There’s always the classic pumpkin (my colleague Melissa Clark has a great recipe). But if you’re looking to make something extra special this year, consider these six stunning pies.\n\nThey are fruity, tangy and creamy, but not overly sweet. The best part: the recipes are made for beginners like me.\n\nFound in a shoe box: The actress Zosia Mamet explained the mystery behind her canary diamond ring.\n\nAsk our Well desk: Can SAD lamps actually help with seasonal depression?\n\n“Eternity” cast: Elizabeth Olsen, Miles Teller and Da’Vine Joy Randolph came to The Times’s kitchen studio to make their ultimate pizzas.\n\nTrash or treasure: My colleagues at Wirecutter spent over $700 to buy a 450-pound, 6-foot-tall mystery box of returned products. Here’s what they found inside.\n\nCook: There’s something safe and comforting about a biscuit. This vegan recipe does the trick.\n\nWatch: Here are this month’s best under-the-radar streaming picks.\n\nRead: “The Rush” is one of our columnist’s favorite recent historical fiction books.\n\nListen: Tap your feet (or sing along) to these songs from musicals.\n\nTend: A botanical designer explains how to make your houseplants stand out.\n\nTest yourself: Take our quiz to see how well you know these award-winning books.\n\nPlay: Here are today’s Spelling Bee, Wordle and Mini Crossword. Find all our games here.\n\nKissing has always been something of a evolutionary mystery. It doesn’t present much benefit for survival. It has minimal reproductive advantages. And it’s mostly symbolic. But according to a new study, species have been locking lips for at least 16 million years.\n\nIt’s not just humans and our ancestors, either. Ants? They smooch. Fish? Kissers. So, too, are albatrosses and polar bears. It suggests that perhaps there’s something primitive about our search for connection.\n\nHave a loving evening.\n\nThanks for reading. I’ll be back tomorrow. — Matthew\n\nPhilip Pacheco was our photo editor.\n\nWe welcome your feedback.

Lauder swooped in with a $131 million donation, the largest in the museum’s history.\n\nLauder five years later bestowed his benevolence on the Metropolitan Museum of Art, giving it a Cubist trove valued at $1 billion, the most significant gift in its history.\n\n“Most collectors give a big gift and then it’s over,” Lauder told The New York Times last year, “I never stop.’’\n\nLike Lauder, Agnes Gund was a major supporter of institutions like the Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 and did more than simply write checks. In the 1990s, when her fellow MoMA board members balked at adding living contemporary artists to the collection, Gund — known as Aggie — not only spoke up, but showed up with donations of works by the likes of Nick Cave, Julie Mehretu, Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker.\n\n“Where it required moral leadership, Aggie was always there,” said Glenn D. Lowry, the museum’s former director, “despite a lot of pressure from her peers.”\n\nFor half a century, Lauder and Gund were among the leading lights of arts philanthropy in New York, but both died this year, leaving a gaping hole in the cultural firmament and highlighting the dearth of comparable titans coming up behind them.\n\n“There are very few all-in-one philanthropists. Leonard and Aggie were those all-in-one philanthropists,” said Adam D. Weinberg, the former longtime director of the Whitney. “They could open doors, they could bring people together, they would give money, they would give art. It takes three different board members to contribute what they could.”\n\nThe arts in New York, and beyond, have been built on the shoulders of people who were not just wealthy, but also passionately committed to supporting the growth of cultural institutions. The Astors, Carnegies, Rockefellers, Fricks and Guggenheims made supporting the arts powerful and prestigious.\n\nIn some cases — Andrew Carnegie comes to mind — philanthropy was the flip side of a certain ruthlessness in the pursuit of business goals. And sometimes generous donors have defaulted on their donations or been tainted by scandal. But whether virtuous or simply ambitious, the breed of arts magnates seems to be dwindling at a time when cultural organizations most need champions.\n\nFederal art funding has been cut. Many nonprofit arts groups continue to struggle to regain prepandemic audiences. And the data points to a precipitous decline in private donations.\n\nOne-third of American museums have lost government grants or contracts since President Trump took office, according to a survey released this month by the American Alliance of Museums, which represents 35,000 museums and museum professionals across the country. The losses have forced museums to defer construction projects, reduce or cancel programming and lay off employees.\n\nIndividual donations to arts institutions fell by more than 30 percent in just one year, according to a recent study by SMU DataArts, the National Center for Arts Research, at Southern Methodist University, which analyzed data from more than 6,500 arts nonprofits. Corporate support declined by 41 percent, government funding by 26 percent and foundation funding by 25 percent.\n\n“When you look across the entire donor landscape, what you see is increased expenses, massively smaller audiences and fewer donors,” said Karen Brooks Hopkins, the former long-serving president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. “When you put these three things together, you have a serious financial problem.”\n\nPart of the decline in cultural giving is because of an overall sense of financial uncertainty under Trump’s tariffs, arts experts say, as well as the competing pull of social and political causes. Aggravating matters, tax law changes due to take effect in 2026 will affect arts donations by introducing a floor on itemized deductions, capping the deduction benefit for high-income donors.\n\n“That will make it even less attractive for wealthy people to contribute to charities,” Hopkins said.\n\nWhile Gund and Lauder distributed their largess among multiple institutions and maintained it over decades, arts experts say that today’s donors may step up for one particular gala, capital campaign, performance or exhibition.\n\n“Where are the most important arts patrons — the ones we could count on to support so many things?” said Michael M. Kaiser, chairman of the DeVos Institute of Arts and Nonprofit Management at the University of Maryland, who used to head the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. “We’re now in this time where we’re losing so many of these around the country.”\n\nDonors in the league of a Gund or a Lauder are themselves often well past 70, without a clear crop of new blood in their wake.\n\nMichael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and the financier who gave $130 million gifts to the Perelman Performing Arts Center in Lower Manhattan and the Shed in Hudson Yards, is 83. David Geffen, the entertainment mogul who gave $150 million to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s new building and $100 million toward the New York Philharmonic’s refurbished home at Lincoln Center, is 82.\n\nStephen A. Schwarzman, the Wall Street financier who gave $150 million to Yale University for a cultural center and $100 million to the New York Public Library, is 78. And David M. Rubenstein, the former chairman of the Kennedy Center who contributed $120 million to that institution over the years, is 76.\n\nLauder’s brother, Ronald S. Lauder, who helped found the Neue Galerie, gave a large gift of arms and armor to the Met and has donated generously to MoMA as a trustee, is 81.\n\n“If you look at the arc of New York City history over the last 100 years, there were seminal figures who played unique and transformational roles in defining art and culture,” said Darren Walker, the former president of the Ford Foundation. “They were people who defined the landscape of cultural life in the city through the institutions they built, the art they bought and donated and the kinds of artistic endeavors they supported — whether it was in museums or dance or theater or music.\n\n“They weren’t just arts patrons, they were civic leaders,” he added, “and other wealthy philanthropists followed.”\n\nThe landscape is not devoid of generous art devotees. A younger generation includes Sarah Arison, 41, who last year became president of MoMA’s board of trustees; Anne-Cecilie Engell Speyer, 49, who recently became president of the Whitney; and Blair Effron, 63, who serves on the boards of both the Met Museum and Lincoln Center.\n\nAgnes Hsu‐Tang is another younger philanthropist who has become an important supporter of the arts. She is 53, though her husband, Oscar L. Tang, is 87. Together they have given $125 million to the Met Museum’s new Modern and contemporary wing, $40 million to endow the Philharmonic’s chair for the maestro Gustavo Dudamel, and $20 million for ​​the New York Historical to complete its new Wing for American Democracy.\n\nEngell Speyer said that, given New York’s long tradition of cultural giving, philanthropic leaders will emerge over time. “It takes years,” she said. “You’re not born a legend.”\n\nMario J. Palumbo Jr., the chairman of the High Line, added that it was important for cultural organizations to move beyond the fund-raising model of “burrata salads at events” and think creatively about how to increase earned revenue and ease the burden on individual donors (the High Line is working on a new retail program).\n\n“Aggie Gund and Leonard Lauder were giants and I don’t see giants behind them,” he said. “But I see deeply engaged people who care a lot about these organizations who are determined to grow the bases of support and that gives me hope.”\n\nGund’s legacy grew because of the breadth of her involvement (she was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1997). She championed female artists and artists of color, co-founding the Center for Curatorial Leadership to train a diverse crop of curators; founded Studio in a School to give artists steady teaching work; and used $165 million from the sale of her prized Roy Lichtenstein to create Art for Justice to support organizations working in criminal justice reform.\n\nGund was known for traipsing around to artist studios, classrooms, galas and gallery openings — no matter how far-flung — even into her final days, as her physical capacities became more limited.\n\n“In some ways, her collecting was secondary to her relationship to the artists themselves,” said the artist Glenn Ligon. “Lots of people collect work and are generous and serve on boards. She would show up for things.”\n\nArts experts say that kind of deep and reliable commitment is going to be hard to come by going forward.\n\n“It’s a very scary time for the arts,” Kaiser said. “Many organizations have been losing some of their major patrons. And they’re not being replaced.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/us/politics/george-conway-congressional-run.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"15:13:29-05:00","title":"George Conway, a Vocal Foe of Trump, Eyes Congressional Run","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"George T.

Conway III, the former conservative lawyer and one of President Trump’s fiercest critics, is moving closer to announcing a run for Congress in one of Manhattan’s wealthiest and bluest districts, pitching himself to potential donors as a top attorney who does not “have any more effs to give.”\n\nMr. Conway, 62, who currently lives in Bethesda, Md., has hired the Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg to work on a budding campaign to succeed Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who is retiring. He is also scouting apartments in the district where he lived and worked for years before relocating to Washington in 2017 when his wife at the time, Kellyanne Conway, joined the first Trump administration as a senior White House official. (The Conways divorced in 2023.)\n\nMr. Conway outlined his pitch on Tuesday night at a private virtual event for paid members of Democracy Docket, the media outlet founded by Marc Elias, the Democratic attorney.\n\nThere, he said he had landed on the idea of running for Mr. Nadler’s seat after feeling frustrated by the eight Senate Democrats who caved this month and voted with Republicans to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health care subsidies.\n\nOnce he started thinking about it, Mr. Conway said, he quickly came to the conclusion that “this is crazy, but the crazy thing about it is it’s not so crazy,” according to a video of the event obtained by The New York Times.\n\nMr. Conway, once a card-carrying member of the conservative Federalist Society who also worked behind the scenes on behalf of former President Bill Clinton’s accusers, said he would run as a Democrat.\n\n“That will put some people off, I think,” he said.\n\nBut he said his pitch to voters would be that he has proved himself to be a fearless opponent to Mr. Trump. And he said he would serve in Congress as a “wingman” to attorneys like Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, and Representative Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York, who won his seat in Congress after serving as the lead counsel in Mr. Trump’s first impeachment trial.\n\n“This is the time for a lawyer who has never been in politics to go into politics,” Mr. Conway said. “This is lawyering now.”\n\nReferring to Mr. Trump and his administration, he added: “We need to do things to make sure there is accountability. We need to undo the damage that he has done to the Justice Department. And then we have to create new safeguards that are going to make the Watergate safeguards look like child’s play.”\n\nMr. Conway, once a Trump supporter who cried tears of joy on election night in 2016, began publicly rebuking the president shortly after he was sworn in for his first term, when he fired James Comey, the director of the F.B.I. Mr. Conway’s vocal critiques of the president, coming from a man whose wife served as one of his top White House advisers, helped Mr. Conway build a following online.\n\nThere, he often diagnosed Mr. Trump with narcissistic personality disorder and declared him unfit to hold office.\n\nMr. Trump helped fuel the feud, calling Mr. Conway a “stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!” When the Conways divorced in 2023, Mr. Trump congratulated Ms. Conway on finally ridding herself of her “wacko husband.”\n\nIf he were to run, Mr. Conway would enter a crowded field that might still become larger. There are already 10 people running in the Democratic primary, including a Kennedy scion, a Gen Z democratic socialist and Mr. Nadler’s own longtime confidant who has been considered the favorite and heir apparent to the seat.\n\nOn the Tuesday night call, Mr. Conway told the group that Democrats needed “people who don’t have any more effs to give. That’s the advantage I have. I’m not going to run for anything else.”\n\nHe added: “I want to fight these mothers. This looks like a way to do it.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/opinion/rolex-gold-trump-corruption.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:03:43-05:00","title":"The White House Gold Rush Is On","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article criticizes the Trump administration for widespread corruption, including financial gains from deals, foreign gifts, and pardons, with specific examples involving Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Swiss business leaders, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Part of the president’s relationship with Prince Mohammed includes lucrative ties between the Trump Organization and Saudi firms, to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. It is for this reason, perhaps, that the president angrily dismissed the idea, evidence of which U.S. intelligence long ago gathered, that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, in 2018. The crown prince denies it. “Things happen,” Trump said.\n\nEarlier this month, top Swiss business leaders arrived at the White House bearing lavish gifts fit for a king. The chief executive of Rolex gave President Trump a gold-plated desk clock. Not to be outdone, the chief executive of a gold-refining company presented him with a 2-pound gold bar engraved with 45 and 47, in honor of his two presidencies. A week later, the president rewarded Switzerland with a favorable break on tariffs, reducing them from 39 percent to 15 percent.\n\nThis summer, The New Yorker reported that the Trump family had earned $3.4 billion through deals it had arranged since Trump entered the White House in 2017. The Trump Organization is also expanding its operations around the world, developing more than 22 properties in at least 10 countries, whose leaders have every incentive to flatter the president with gifts and handouts.\n\nAnd ProPublica reports that Kristi Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, directed more than $220 million worth of funding for an ad campaign to a consulting firm with “longstanding personal and business ties to Noem and her senior aides at D.H.S.”\n\nIn any other administration, at any other time in American history, this level of corruption would be a political disaster — a scandal that could bring down the administration. For the Trump administration, it is a Tuesday.\n\nIf Trump’s first term was marked by a level of graft and self-dealing that would have embarrassed a Tammany stalwart, then his second term seems to be an explicit effort to outpace his previous record and set a new high-water mark for political corruption in the United States.\n\nIn the first six months of his second term, Trump made nearly a hundred visits to his properties — paid for by the American taxpayer. Foreign governments and special interest groups routinely use those properties for events — putting millions of dollars directly in the family’s coffers. And then there are the pardons for donors and supporters like Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of Binance, the world’s largest exchange for cryptocurrency. Zhao had been working to give a boost to a crypto company founded by Trump’s sons.\n\nBy any and every measure, in other words, Donald Trump is the most corrupt person to ever sit in the Oval Office. And if the A plot of the second Trump presidency is his authoritarian aspirations, then its B plot is his shameless and pervasive corruption.\n\nHere, it’s easy to imagine the response of one of the president’s many apologists. This is normal, they would say, don’t kid yourself. Washington has always been corrupt. Isn’t it better that Trump is honest about his self-dealing? At least he’s not a hypocrite.\n\nThis is a common tactic of those who would abuse the public trust. If everyone does it, then there is no point in blaming anyone in particular. The MAGA effort to make Hunter Biden the poster child for political corruption under the previous administration was an example of just this, a tactic meant to obscure the wanton corruption of Trump and his allies.\n\nThere is no question that American politics has had its fair share of corrupt acts and corrupt people. But the office of the presidency in particular has never seen anything like the petty jobbery and open malfeasance of Trump and the people around him. All misdeeds are not the same, and there is a real difference between the unseemly revolving door between business and government — the plum position on a corporate board or an easy lobbying gig — and a new status quo in which business leaders and heads of state give the president actual tribute in order to put themselves in the good graces of the White House.\n\nConsider the way that FIFA, the international soccer organization, created a new global “peace prize” following Trump’s failed effort to win a Nobel Peace Prize. It will be announced Dec. 5 in Washington. I wonder who’s going to win. It would be funny — the stuff, at least, of a late-night television sketch — if it weren’t so corrosive.\n\nIn truth, it is probably wrong to describe the president’s corruption as the B plot of his administration. When we look at authoritarian leaders abroad, we see a tight connection between autocratic governance and extreme graft. If the regimes of both Vladimir Putin in Russia and Viktor Orban in Hungary are models for Trump and his far-right allies in both ideological and practical terms, then it is worth observing the extent to which both men use their governments to siphon wealth from the public and hand it to small cadres of regime loyalists. Their obsession with national greatness — with ethnic chauvinism and so-called traditional values — is little more than a cover story for common thieves whose great aspiration is to steal and loot with abandon.\n\nSo it goes for Trump, whose effort to rule the United States as an autocrat is as much about clearing the way for a smash and grab as it is anything else. The old Republican Party was a stool with three legs: social conservatism, economic conservatism and national security conservatism. So too is the MAGA Republican Party. One of those legs is the nativist extremism of Stephen Miller. The second is the anti-government extremism of Russell Vought. And the last is the open, flamboyant corruption of Donald Trump — a corruption that degrades a people’s faith in government and makes it all the easier to remake the state in the image of a single man.\n\nAmericans of the Revolutionary era feared nothing more than the specter of corruption which was, in this usage, a malady of both the individual spirit and the body politic.\n\n“In a Republic,” declared Samuel West, a prominent Massachusetts Congregationalist minister, in 1786, “the people are not only the source of authority, but the exercise of it, is in a great measure, lodged in their hands. Corruption therefore among the people at large, must be immediately felt, and if not seasonably prevented, proves fatal in the end.”\n\nAmericans fretted over the potential corruption of the political system, in which public good was captured by private interest. In the years before independence, those colonists steeped in republican ideology identified this with the Crown’s use of personal flattery and patronage to try to curb popular discontent. To bestow favors and titles on Americans was to, for these critics, to erode the people’s capacity for self-government. In “The Creation of the American Republic: 1776-1787,” the historian Gordon Wood quotes a Virginian lamenting, in 1775, that the “vices” of Britain had “extended to America”: “The torrent as yet is but small; only a few are involved in it; it must soon be stopped, or it will bear all before it with an impetuous sway.”\n\nAmericans also believed that this political corruption would fuel personal corruption and degrade the morals of society as a whole. “Whenever democratic states degenerate from those noble republican virtues which constitute the chief excellency, spring, and even basis of their government, and instead of industry, frugality, and economy, encourage luxury, dissipation and extravagance,” Joel Barlow, a poet, politician and later United States minister to France, warned in 1787, “we may justly conclude that ruin is near at hand.”\n\nThis preoccupation with corruption made its way into the Constitution, both as a set of specific prohibitions on titles and emoluments — as well as one of the named offenses (“bribery”) that would justify impeachment — and as a vital part of the structure of the system itself. Why does the Constitution require members of Congress to resign their positions before taking service in the federal government? To guard against “intrigue” among those who serve in the national legislature. “If we do not provide against corruption,” Virginia’s George Mason said in reference to this provision at the constitutional convention in Philadelphia, “our government will soon be at an end.”\n\nWhy, in the case of an Electoral College tie or plurality, does the House and not the Senate choose the president? Because to have such a small and unrepresentative chamber make the decision “lays a certain foundation for corruption and aristocracy,” as another delegate in Philadelphia put it. And why did the framers easily agree to give federal judges life tenure as well as constitutional protection for their compensation? To preclude the corrupt manipulation of the judiciary by those in power. Recall that in the Declaration of Independence, American revolutionaries complained that the King George III had “made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of their Offices, and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries.”\n\nThe Constitution was meant, in other words, to be a bulwark against corruption of the system and thus of the people. It is obviously not working.\n\nA prohibition like the Article II Emoluments Clause is nothing more than a parchment barrier — if no one acts on it, then it doesn’t really exist. Congress, for reasons of partisan and political self-interest, has been inert. And the Supreme Court, which has claimed for itself the right to remake the Constitution as it sees fit, has all but nullified any attempt to hold corrupt officials accountable by defining bribery out of existence. For Chief Justice John Roberts especially, if it isn’t a direct quid pro quo — one assumes with a sack of money marked with dollar signs — then it doesn’t actually count.\n\nHere it is important to remember that neither the Congress nor the Supreme Court owns the Constitution. Nor, for that matter, does the president. As much as it may often seem otherwise, we are still the authors of our own fates. If we, as citizens, decide that we want to resurrect our nation’s dead commitment to a politics of anti-corruption, then we can. It is within our power to do so, a task to accomplish through political action on the street and at the ballot box.\n\nAnd if corruption and authoritarianism are tied together — if they are two acts in the same story — then the struggle against Trump’s authoritarian designs must also be a struggle against his personal corruption as well as the corruption of the political system.\n\n“Just as good customs require laws in order to be maintained,” Machiavelli observed in his commentaries on the Roman historian Livy, “so laws require good customs in order to be observed.”\n\nWhen either laws or customs degrade, when the body politic begins to drift toward corruption, the only recourse — if the people hope to preserve a republic — is to build new institutions and with them new ways of political life.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
