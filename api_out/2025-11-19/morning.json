The market is already nervous \n       \n  By John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market’s  recent bout of volatility . So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The stock market rally —  ﻿ that had been going practically nonstop since April until this month’s blip — largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years.\n \n\n   \n  Investors are now eager to know whether demand for Nvidia’s chips — and its optimism about the future — are continuing to grow or if there are signs of AI fatigue.\n \n\n   \n  Less-than-stellar earnings this month from tech company Palantir ( PLTR ), which uses AI for its government contracts, gave Wall Street pause — and fueled a  sell-off in AI stocks  over the past several weeks. Nvidia’s stock ( NVDA ) has fallen more than 10% this month, although it’s still up 35% this year.\n \n\n   \n  ”The market for the first time is questioning whether the hype will turn into reality,” Bob Elliott, CIO at asset management firm Unlimited Funds, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s chips power part of practically every major AI venture, meaning investors will scrutinize its earnings as well as chief executive Jensen Huang’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  “Nvidia takes on even greater weight than normal,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t confirm high expectations built into the market, then watch out below.”\n \n\n   \n    Market-moving earnings\n \n\n   \n  Every investor should care about Nvidia’s earnings this afternoon: Nvidia accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. That means investors — and those with 401(k)s — are increasingly exposed to the company’s strong gains. Similarly, they are more exposed to a drop in Nvidia’s stock price.\n \n\n   \n  Since Nvidia last reported earnings in August, concerns have been rising about  circular financing , with tech companies entwined in a massive web of extraordinarily lucrative deals.\n \n\n   \n  Now nerves are fraying about whether the money being poured into the AI boom will be justified. On top of that, tech stocks have become relatively expensive.\n \n\n   \n  “Nvidia’s earnings on Wednesday are particularly important given the rising skepticism regarding the longevity of the AI cycle and current AI stock valuations,” James Demmert,   CIO at Main Street Research, said in an email. “Anything less than a stellar report and outlook could make stock indexes vulnerable.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’s bigger than just Wall Street. There are concerns that the AI boom — which has helped boost US economic growth this year — is now masking signs of weakness in the economy.\n \n\n   \n  At its market value of $4.4 trillion, Nvidia is currently larger than every country’s economy except the United States, China and Germany.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia’s fate is interlinked with other big tech companies that depend on its products. A sign of a slowdown in demand could signal that the other tech companies are less confident about the AI buildout. \n \n\n   \n  Some Wall Street analysts are optimistic that Nvidia will continue to deliver impressive earnings. AI chatbots like ChatGPT — and the data centers powering AI — depend on the company’s chips. It’s the foundation of the current AI wave.\n \n\n   \n  “That is why everyone listens to every word that Jensen Huang has to say, because it’s a good gauge of the health of the AI ecosystem,” said Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Matt Egan contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/target-stock-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"07:35:00-05:00","title":"Target May Have Hit Rock Bottom: Sales Drop, Profit Guidance Cut, Leadership Change, and Customer Backlash","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Target is facing a deep downturn in sales and market share, with declining customer trust, shrinking profits, and a loss of relevance in an inflationary economy.

season of significant change as a number of high-profile designers made their debuts at big brands. While many of those designs are not yet available for general purchase or widespread red-carpet wear, they’ve already been spotted in the wild — worn by an exclusive few.\n \n\n   \n  Getting their clothes on famous individuals is important for brands. “In some cases, it’s because the brands have employed these people as ambassadors, so they’re on payroll,” said Booth Moore, a veteran editor and author of books including “American Runway,” pointing to the actor Greta Lee, who was recently named as a global face for Dior and has attended several high-profile events wearing the brand’s latest designs. “In other cases, it’s people who are highly visible because they have a show or film to promote, like Sarah Paulson who has been wearing Balenciaga. Sometimes, it’s just a one-off, like we’ve seen with Michelle Obama, who is arguably one of the most visible women in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Only a few years ago, the red carpet was representative of fashion’s production schedule, with celebrities wearing runway looks around the time that the collections arrived in stores. These moments played a key part in motivating shoppers to buy — even if it is a more affordable lipstick or perfume. That pipeline has now shrunk to reflect shorter attention spans: what was shown on the catwalk a mere month ago can now be seen at movie premieres, film festivals, awards ceremonies, talk shows, galas, and other glitzy celebrity events, which seem to be multiplying in abundance.\n \n\n   \n  Some fashion designers, including Dario Vitale of Versace, have sped things up even further by  showing their designs on the red carpet even before they hit the catwalk . “There are a record number of brands trying to change their image at the same time,” said Moore. “They’re in races against each other, and their reliance on Hollywood as a promotional machine has increased so much in recent years, that there’s this kind-of feeding frenzy to reach the right people, and to get to them first.”\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the competition is now heated among stylists to outdo each other, as they vie for the approval of online commentators and the media’s best-dressed lists. For some, there is kudos in  reviving an archival or vintage design , but for many others, being the first to wear something still translates to access, status, and trend-setting power. And while celebrities have typically worn custom designs to the biggest red carpet events, any occasion now seems to be fair game.\n \n\n   \n  See the latest catwalk looks — and who wore them where — below.\n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   \n    \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/middleeast/iran-us-nuclear-talks-intw-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00-04:00","title":"Exclusive: Iran open to resuming nuclear talks with the US but won’t shift its conditions, supreme leader’s adviser says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran, under the leadership of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and advised by Kamal Kharrazi, has expressed willingness to resume nuclear talks with the United States on the condition of mutual respect and equal footing, without altering its pre-June 2025 positions.

adviser says \n       \n  By Frederik Pleitgen, Claudia Otto and Abbas Al Lawati, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:01 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran is willing to resume  nuclear talks with the United States  if they are conducted respectfully, a senior Iranian official told CNN on Tuesday, while insisting Tehran will not move from the position it held before the  US and Israel attacked it in June. \n \n\n   \n  “They have to make the first move to show that they are ready to engage with us on the conditions that we put… it has to be based on equal footing and mutual respect,” said Kamal Kharrazi, foreign policy adviser to Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , in an exclusive interview with CNN from Tehran. “The agenda would be prepared in advance to ensure the clarity of substance and the process of discussions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, President (Donald) Trump does not believe in diplomatic engagement but rather prefers to use force to achieve his objectives,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Later on Tuesday, Trump said that Iran is “very much” signaling interest in striking a deal with the US over its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  “They’d like very much to make a deal with us, and they call us, and we’ll end up probably doing that, that’s Iran,” Trump said in a room filled with high-profile guests at a White House dinner honoring Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s comments echoed remarks he made earlier in the day, when he indicated he was open to pursuing negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Kharrazi indicated that Iran’s conditions for a rapprochement with Washington have not changed since the US and Israel struck its nuclear facilities in June, adding that uranium enrichment will continue because the country needs the fuel for its power plants and for medical purposes. Tehran’s ballistic missile program, which he said is expanding, will also be off the negotiating table. “It is only the nuclear issue we will discuss with the United States,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration and Iran were in the middle of talks to settle their dispute in June when Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran, eventually drawing in Washington, which carried out strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, the first direct US attack inside Iran.\n \n\n   \n  Almost five months on, the damage to Iran’s nuclear facilities has yet to be assessed, Kharrazi said.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Saeed Khatibzadeh told CNN that despite serious damage to “infrastructure, machineries” and “buildings,” the country’s nuclear program  remained “intact.”  On the same day, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that no uranium enrichment was taking place “right now” because the country’s facilities had been attacked.\n \n\n   \n  During the Iran-US talks in the summer, Washington had insisted that Iran stop enriching uranium altogether, while Tehran was adamant about continuing domestic enrichment to a purity that cannot be used to build nuclear bombs. Highly enriched uranium is a key component of a nuclear weapon.\n \n\n   \n  Kharrazi said the “degree of enrichment,” not enrichment itself, would be the focus of potential negotiations with the US.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he is concerned about another military confrontation with the US or Israel, he said: “Everything is possible. But we are ready for that.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported in June that Washington had made a proposal for a nuclear deal under which the US would invest in Iran’s civilian nuclear power program and  join a consortium  that would oversee the enrichment of low-level uranium inside Iran for an unspecified amount of time. That potential consortium would be expected to include Middle Eastern nations and the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Iranian officials repeatedly said they are open to the idea of an enrichment consortium but insisted Iran must be able to keep control of its own enrichment capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN if there is room to reach an understanding with the US on Iran’s nuclear program, including on a potential consortium, Kharrazi said, “I think so.”\n \n\n   \n  “If there would be genuine negotiations between Iran and the United States, there are ways and means (of) how to ensure that Iran can continue its enrichment and at the same time assure the others that it’s not going to look for nuclear weapons.”\n \n\n   \n  Kharrazi also had a message for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Start with a positive approach with Iran. If it will be positive, certainly it will be reciprocated. But for that, they (the US) have to refrain from any force against Iran,” he said. “They have tried that and they now understand that it’s not acceptable and it’s not workable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/weather/polar-vortex-cold-snowy-december-stratosphere","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"07:36:00-05:00","title":"The polar vortex is about to bring a wild weather pattern change","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sudden stratospheric warming event in the stratosphere above the North Pole is weakening the polar vortex, a high-altitude wind pattern that normally contains cold Arctic air.

Over the next 10 days, changes in the stratosphere will upend weather patterns and set the stage for a cold, snowy December across parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\n \n\n   \n  It will mean a dramatic swing in weather for parts of the US that are currently simmering in record heat just a week before Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  It could also be one of the earliest significant  polar vortex disruptions  recorded since the dawn of the satellite era.\n \n\n   \n  Think of the stratospheric polar vortex   like a wall of wind, corralling the ultra-cold, Arctic air over the North Pole. When it weakens, cold air spills south into places like the Lower 48, Europe and Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Right now, the air in the stratosphere — the layer of the atmosphere above where most weather occurs — is warming quickly and dramatically, in a phenomenon known as a  sudden stratospheric warming event .\n \n\n   \n  But the sudden warming in the far upper atmosphere is going to result in anything but warmth. It is causing the polar vortex winds to weaken, said Amy H. Butler, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they could even reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists are still trying to figure out why these warming events happen, and for good reason: they can trigger the most intense “polar vortex” cold-air outbreaks in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next two weeks, these shifts could start to be felt in North America, Europe and Asia as the polar vortex weakens and tumbles south, like a spinning top that slows and wobbles off course.\n \n\n   \n  One unusual feature of this event is its timing; sudden stratospheric warming events of this magnitude are almost unheard of in November, said meteorologist Judah Cohen, a research scientist at MIT.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still not certain there will be a major winter blast, but scientists are watching for colder than normal conditions to develop in the mid-latitudes — where most of the world’s population resides — over the next month or so. Once the polar vortex is disrupted, it can take a month or more to recover, said Andrea Lopez Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n \n\n   \n  What’s most difficult to predict is where the polar vortex will deliver its icy blast, and the temperature outlooks aren’t taking it fully into account, yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see more active and shifted storm tracks and increases in cold air outbreaks in regions across the Northern Hemisphere,” she said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Both Butler and Lopez Lang said having accurate forecasts for polar vortex events can help make 7- to 10-day forecasts better, which can be beneficial for decision-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Even though the stratospheric polar vortex is miles above us, it’s sometimes connected to our weather via invisible puppet strings we describe with atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics,” Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  For example, other polar vortex events early in the winter have been followed by colder and snowier Decembers in the US, she said. Polar vortex events like these tend to generate a ridge of warm, high pressure over Alaska, which triggers a dip, or trough, in the jet stream to the east. That trough can usher in colder, snowier weather over the Central states and portions of the Eastern US.    \n \n\n   \n  As impactful as these polar vortex events are, scientists are losing some of their eyes on this layer of the atmosphere, Lopez Lang said.\n \n\n   \n  Satellites are crucial to observing the stratosphere and making predictions about sudden stratospheric warming events,   she said, and some of that data is blinking out as satellites age and  NOAA makes budget and program decisions  that affect the availability of current and future measurements. She cited some  newly missing data from polar-orbiting satellites  as an example.\n \n\n   \n  “The only way that we really observe these phenomena is via satellite data,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/politics/lame-duck-presidency-trump-epstein-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Is Trump a Lame Duck Now?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, despite being in office during his second term, is facing growing political isolation within the Republican Party, particularly on issues like the release of non-classified files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

And he fell in line.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than face a massive defection of Republican votes in the House,  Trump flipped to support a bill  to force the Department of Justice to release non-classified files related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The flip-flop was a long time coming. The House of Representatives stayed out of session for more than a month during the government shutdown, which helped to shield Trump from this vote. After Trump ultimately endorsed the bill he had previously opposed, there was near-unanimity  when the House voted on it Tuesday .\n \n\n   \n  It now appears to be on a glide path to Trump’s desk.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear that Trump will appear in the remainder of the files as he did in  emails from Epstein’s estate  released by the House Oversight Committee last week. But it’s definitely clear that Trump has no interest in continuing to talk about Epstein. When a reporter asked Trump in the Oval Office Tuesday why he doesn’t just release the files, he shot back that she was a bad reporter.\n \n\n   \n  “Quiet, piggy,” was how he sternly reacted with a pointed finger to another reporter last week on Air Force One when she asked about the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  The argument that seems to have convinced Republicans to break with Trump on releasing the Epstein files and vote was best expressed by Rep. Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who has tangled with the administration on multiple issues.\n \n\n   \n  “The deal for Republicans on this vote is that Trump will protect you if you vote the wrong way,” Massie told CNN’s Manu Raju last week. “In other words, if you vote to cover up for pedophiles, you’ve got cover in a Republican primary. But I would remind my colleagues that this vote is gonna be on your record for longer than Trump is gonna be president.”\n \n\n   \n  Pair that sentiment with Trump’s recent acknowledgment that he will not be on the ballot in 2028, which means he won’t be president in 2029, and you have the makings of a lame-duck presidency.\n \n\n   \n  There are other issues dividing the GOP, as  CNN’s Aaron Blake noted Tuesday.  In addition to the Epstein files, Republicans are grousing about Trump’s foreign focus; his apparent  lack of understanding of the issue of  affordability  and how it relates to his tariff policy; the destruction of the White House East Wing; and the way his family is appearing to enrich itself.\n \n\n   \n  Pretty much all of these issues were on display at Trump’s Oval Office appearance Monday, when he sat next to and defended  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman .\n \n\n   \n  None of this means that Republican lawmakers are going to turn on Trump en masse in the near future. But it does mean you will hear that term, lame duck, with more frequency.\n \n\n   \n    What is a lame duck?\n \n\n   \n  Believe it or not, “lame duck” is a technical term in US politics. Historians in both the House and Senate track lame-duck terms.\n \n\n   \n  To them, it refers to a politician in the period after their successor has been elected, but before that person is sworn in. The outgoing politician still technically has power, but is no longer really accountable to voters.\n \n\n   \n    Is Trump a lame duck now?\n \n\n   \n  From a technical standpoint, no. US voters will vote twice before Trump leaves office: in midterms next year and the general election to replace him in 2028. His presidency will play a factor in both of those elections. The government will have to be funded each year, and natural disasters and other events will require leadership.\n \n\n   \n  But the term also has a more colloquial meaning that refers to anyone who can’t be reelected. That included Trump starting on Day 1 of his second term. But his superpower in recent years has been his hold over the Republican Party. That power, at least in theory, will fade a smidge every time he asks Republican lawmakers to do something voters will not like.\n \n\n   \n    Lame-duck presidencies can be dangerous times\n \n\n   \n  Just because a president is losing power does not mean there is nothing important going on. The ultimate lame-duck disaster occurred in 1860, after the election of Abraham Lincoln but before he was sworn in. That’s when Southern states started seceding from the union,  starting with South Carolina in December .\n \n\n   \n  George W. Bush ushered in a bailout to the financial system during the Great Recession just before his successor, Barack Obama, was elected.\n \n\n   \n    How have lame ducks changed?\n \n\n   \n  The 20th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1933 in part to shorten the length of lame-duck sessions. Originally, in the pre-modern horse-and-buggy era, unless the president called Congress into session earlier, lawmakers would not convene for a new Congress until  13 months  after Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a lot more time than that — a little less than 36 months — until the next presidential election.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/business/stimulus-check-trump-tariff-dividend","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"4 Reasons You Probably Won’t Get a $2,000 Check from Trump Soon (and 1 Scary Reason You Might)","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has promised to distribute $2,000 tariff rebate checks to American households in 2026, citing revenue from new tariffs as a source.

won’t get a $2,000 check from Trump soon (and 1 scary reason you might) \n       \n  Analysis by Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has promised to deliver $2,000 tariff rebate checks next year, raising hopes of a lifeline for millions of Americans  struggling to make ends meet .\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money. We’re going to be issuing dividends…probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that, of thousands of dollars for individuals of moderate income, middle income,”  Trump said  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump has suggested  these checks  are essentially a done deal, the reality is there are major, perhaps insurmountable,  obstacles standing in the way .\n \n\n   \n  Experts tell CNN it is improbable the federal government will  send out $2,000 checks  next year – unless it looks like the US economy needs to be rescued from an imminent recession.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s highly unlikely there is some sort of stimulus check sent out next year. I would be pretty shocked,” Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, told CNN in a phone interview.\n \n\n   \n  Bettors on prediction platform Polymarket seem to agree. They  place just an 11% chance  that Trump creates a tariff dividend by March 31.\n \n\n   \n     The math doesn’t math \n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the biggest obstacle is that the numbers don’t add up.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs are undoubtedly generating gobs of money for the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new tariffs are projected to raise $158.4 billion in total revenue in 2025, and another $207.5 billion in 2026, according to  estimates  from the Tax Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to say exactly how much tariff dividend checks will cost because virtually no details have been released.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the Tax Foundation modeled three designs for tariff dividends – and all of them would cost more than the new tariffs are projected to bring in this year.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, if the checks went out only to tax filers and spouses, and had a hard cut off at $100,000 in individual income, they would still cost $279.8 billion, according to the analysis. That’s $121 billion more than projected new tariff revenue this year.\n \n\n   \n  At the high end of the scenarios analyzed, tariff dividends could go out to tax filers and non-filers as well as spouses and dependents. That would cost up to $606.8 billion – or nearly double the combined 2025 and 2026 projected new tariff revenue.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a problem because the Trump administration has already held up tariff revenue as a way to offset the cost of the sweeping tax and spending package Trump signed into law earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  “This is like the magic money tree. You just go to it anytime you need money. Of course, that’s not reality,” said Lincicome.\n \n\n   \n     The votes may not be there \n \n\n   \n  Another major problem is Congress would need to sign off on dividend checks – and it’s far from clear there are the votes for that.\n \n\n   \n  Deficit hawks were already reluctant to back the president’s tax law and this would only magnify budget worries.\n \n\n   \n  “I find it extremely implausible that Republican budget hawks are just going to be okay with blowing another $300 billion to $600 billion,” Lincicome.\n \n\n   \n  After topping $34 trillion for the first time in January 2024, the national debt has continued to mount,  hitting $38 trillion  late last month.\n \n\n   \n     Dividend checks could backfire \n \n\n   \n  There’s no doubt many Americans could use $2,000 checks from Uncle Sam as they struggle to catch up to high prices at the grocery store, on car insurance and elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  However, some economists warn that stimulus checks could backfire by worsening the affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  The problem is that while some people may use the money to pay down debt, others would likely spend it, and that would increase demand. As the last inflation crisis demonstrated, boosting demand without increasing supply drives up prices.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, many Republicans blamed former President Joe Biden’s 2021 stimulus checks for causing the inflation crisis. That could make it difficult for those same lawmakers to support Trump-era stimulus checks.\n \n\n   \n  Academic research has found those  stimulus checks contributed  to the four-decade high in inflation, though they were hardly the only factor. Trillions of dollars in other stimulus, including Trump’s 2020 stimulus checks and the Paycheck Protection Program also contributed.\n \n\n   \n  Even some Trump-friendly economists are highly skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending out checks to people is a bad way to stimulate the economy,” Stephen Moore, co-founder of Unleash Prosperity and a former Trump economic adviser, told CNN in an email. “If there is tariff revenue, that should be used to cut income taxes across the board. Stimulus checks only stimulate inflation.”\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, redeploying tariff revenue to pay for dividend payments risks sparking a  revolt among the so-called bond vigilantes  that drives up Treasury yields that set a benchmark for a number of loan rates. That in turn would make it even more expensive for small businesses to borrow and homebuyers to get a mortgage.\n \n\n   \n  “What Congress and Trump are trying to do with stimulus, the bond market could take away instantly,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James.\n \n\n   \n  That’s one reason stimulus checks are normally reserved for actual emergencies like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n     Supreme Court could wipe out tariff revenue \n \n\n   \n  Beyond the budget, political and economic obstacles, there are legal ones, too.\n \n\n   \n  Most Supreme Court justices during oral arguments earlier this month  sounded skeptical  about Trump’s reliance on emergency powers to impose his global tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The Tax Foundation estimates the tariffs that could get struck down account for about 75% of the new tariff revenue coming in.\n \n\n   \n  “If the Supreme Court says the bulk of the tariffs are illegal, that could throw a wrench in the tariff rebate plan,” said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  For all these reasons, investors and economists on Wall Street are hardly counting on the arrival of $2,000 tariff dividend checks in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve learned that late night Truth Socials are not a direct line to reality,” said Bob Elliott, CEO and chief investment officer at alternative investment firm Unlimited.\n \n\n   \n     ‘Break-the-glass’ moment? \n \n\n   \n  However, one way Trump’s $2,000 dividend checks could become a reality is if they become a necessity.\n \n\n   \n  If trouble in the job market intensifies and the unemployment rate climbs significantly, then the White House could argue direct payments are necessary to prevent a recession or minimize the damage of one.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s almost like we shouldn’t want stimulus checks to happen,” Mills said, “because it would be an indicator of something wrong. This is a break-the-glass, use in case of emergency tool.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/europe/poland-fighter-jets-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"06:03:00-04:00","title":"NATO scrambles fighter jets as rare Russian strikes on western Ukraine kill 19","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant escalation of the Ukraine war, Russia carried out a massive overnight attack on western Ukraine using 470 drones and 48 missiles, killing at least 19 people and injuring dozens, including 16 children.

EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  NATO scrambled fighter jets in Polish and Romanian airspace as Russia carried out a massive overnight attack across Ukraine, killing at least 19 people and injuring dozens more.\n \n\n   \n  Romania’s defense ministry said a  Russian drone entered its airspace  during the attack, which struck apartment buildings in the western city of Ternopil.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of people were injured in the strikes on Ternopil, 16 of them children, Ukraine’s emergency services said.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian attack involved 470 drones and 48 missiles and mostly focused on western areas of Ukraine, which lie close to the borders of Romania and Poland. Russia’s attacks have more commonly targeted the eastern part of the country and many Ukrainians have fled to the west, seeing it as safer.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of people were also wounded in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, where drone strikes damaged apartment buildings and left several cars burning on the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Romania’s defense ministry said it scrambled two Eurofighters, part of NATO’s fleet, and later two Romanian F-16 fighter jets after a Russian drone was detected crossing into the eastern Tulcea region.\n \n\n   \n  Polish and allied fighter jets were also launched to protect Polish airspace on Wednesday morning, the country’s  operational command  said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Russia said it shot down four US-made ATACMS long-range missiles “deep within” its territory on Tuesday, that Ukraine claimed it fired. The missiles were taken down over the city of Voronezh, around 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the Ukrainian border, the Russian defense ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  The use of the missiles, which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles), was first approved under the Biden Presidency and their use has previously been seen by Russia as  a major escalation .\n \n\n   \n  Many regions of Ukraine were left without power Wednesday after strikes on the country’s energy infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Poland’s Rzeszow and Lublin airports, in the country’s east, were also closed “due to the need to ensure freedom of operation for military aviation,” the country’s air navigation service PANSA said on X.  ﻿ They were later reopened.\n \n\n   \n  The latest move by NATO comes during a tense week. Polish officials have pointed the finger at Russia after a  key train track was destroyed  in what Warsaw said was an “unprecedented act of sabotage” committed by two Ukrainian citizens who were “collaborating with Russian services.” Russian officials have denied the accusation.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Poland’s Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski said he would close the last Russian consulate in the country in response to the destruction of the train track. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed regret over the move.\n \n\n   \n  The latest aerial attack by Moscow came hours after Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Turkey to meet with his counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan as he tries to “reinvigorate” peace talks and prisoner of war exchanges with Russia.

house was an ornate treasure. A bitter legal dispute has turned it into an empty eyesore \n       \n  By Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:48 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For more than two centuries, the Antico Caffè Greco has been part of the cultural landscape of Rome. Authors and artists, movie stars and princesses — even cowboys — have all made the pilgrimage to Via dei Condotti, at the foot of the Spanish Steps, to soak up the storied atmosphere of the Italian capital’s oldest coffee house.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, that all changed. The café, a favorite for Romans and tourists, shut its doors. Portraits of former clientele — including Wild West sharpshooter Buffalo Bill — were stripped from its walls; plush red velvet chairs, seating booths and bar stools removed; gilded porcelain tableware carried away.\n \n\n   \n  The venue, as popular among Rome’s 19th-century bourgeoisie as it was with the 1960s “La Dolce Vita” in-crowd, became an empty shell.\n \n\n   \n  Antico Caffè Greco’s sudden demise was the result of a long-running rent dispute between its proprietors, Carlo Pellegrini and Flavia Iozzi, and their landlord, the Israelite Hospital of Rome. The hospital is  a  private institution that also provides healthcare to patients through Italy’s national health service.\n \n\n   \n  It began in September 2017 when an 80-year lease expired and the Israelite Hospital raised the monthly rent from 17,000 euros to 120,000 euros — a leap from about $20,000 to $140,000. The move, it said, was in line with other properties on the street, which is home to stores that include Gucci, Versace and Dior.\n \n\n   \n  High commercial rents have pushed many small businesses out of the center of Rome in recent years, especially since the Covid pandemic when lockdowns fueled the rise of home delivery and online shopping.\n \n\n   \n  “We would be ready to pay more rent to keep the café open but not six times the amount we’re paying now,” Pellegrini said when the Antico lease expired eight years ago. “I feel very angry, but we will fight this.”\n \n\n   \n    Casanova’s café ‘tryst’\n \n\n   \n  That fight was dealt a decisive blow in 2024, when the hospital finally won a court battle to remove the café’s occupants. It’s aim is to reopen the venue with a new tenant.\n \n\n   \n  Until last month, portraits on the walls reflected the café’s past, including the day in 1890 when Buffalo Bill  took his morning coffee  there with some fellow cowboys. It was a favorite haunt of Charles Dickens, Henry James and John Keats in the 19th century. Later, Orson Welles, Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren all spent time there.\n \n\n   \n  Notorious 18th-century seducer Giacomo Casanova even mentioned a “tryst” at the café in his memoir. The sofa in the back where it was said to have taken place became popular with lovers over the centuries since.\n \n\n   \n  Despite above-average prices, customers always seemed to think sipping a cappuccino or hot chocolate from the same cups as Pablo Picasso or Princess Diana was worth paying extra.\n \n\n   \n  Pellegrini and Iozzi were formally evicted in October after losing five appeals and retrials.\n \n\n   \n  The café was shuttered with the help of the military police. The locks were changed and the heavy wooden doors closed for the last time. Lawyers for the hospital removed a temporary “closed for vacation” sign that had been taped to the doors since September.\n \n\n   \n  The court stipulated that the hospital must preserve the historical integrity of the property, but departing staff told CNN through their lawyer that they removed the café’s artwork in September, which included portraits, sculptures and memorabilia said to be worth around 8 million euros, fearing damage from a leaking pipe.\n \n\n   \n  Antonio Maria Leozappa, special commissioner for the Israelite Hospital, told CNN the removed works and furnishings have since been seized by authorities and are now being protected by Italy’s Culture Ministry until new tenants can be found. He said that the hospital was not seeking backpayment from Pellegrini for an annual 100,000 euros rent shortfall since the legal battle began eight years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The Israelite Hospital is a public health asset, and the revenue generated by its properties has always been and will always be used by the Israelite Hospital, an institution affiliated with the National Health System, for the sole purpose of improving healthcare,” the hospital said in a  statement  in 2023 after having won one of many court battles.  It said the rent increase was an attempt to improve healthcare “for the benefit of all citizens.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A tragedy’\n \n\n   \n  Leozappa said the café will open again once work is done in the building. “It is a historic café, it is one of the first in Italy, it dates back to the late 18th century,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Under a new owner, the Antico Caffè Greco will “continue to enjoy a long history, respecting tradition and the established regulations, and the historic character of the place will be preserved,” he added. ”The city, Romans, and tourists will continue to enjoy their coffee at the Antico Caffè Greco for centuries to come.”\n \n\n   \n  Pellegrini isn’t ready to give up the battle just yet. “The matter cannot be closed like this,” his lawyer, Alessandro Ciciarelli, said when the locks were changed.\n \n\n   \n  Whatever happens next, the once-grand space is now an eyesore on one of the most prestigious streets in the city center — one of many empty storefronts, some of which sit vacant for years, that have appeared as a result of soaring commercial and residential prices.\n \n\n   \n  The Antico Caffè Greco’s wooden outdoor terrace now has signs that its empty planters   are not garbage bins.” Curious tourists peer through the windows into the empty space. Inside, the lights are on, but no one is making coffee.\n \n\n   \n  “I came here every day for almost 15 years,” Manuel Capponi, an elderly local who lives at the top of the Spanish Steps, told CNN. “It is a tragedy that it had to close this way, the fights, the anger. But this café — and this city — have weathered worse storms. There will be another café and I’m sure the prices will reflect the higher rent.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/europe/denmark-asylum-immigration-system-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:32:00-05:32","title":"Denmark’s hardline immigration laws have caught Britain’s eye.

Here’s why \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:32 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Denmark’s  biggest exports include  Ozempic , Carlsberg and Lego. But now, European leaders think it has something more valuable to sell: an immigration system tough and effective enough to neuter the hard right and keep mainstream parties in power.\n \n\n   \n  Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, has achieved what many center-left governments of recent years have found impossible: getting reelected. In an age when incumbents keep getting hammered at the ballot box, many in Europe are looking to the asylum policies of Frederiksen’s Social Democrats – which won elections in 2019, 2022, and, polls show, are on course to win again in 2026 – as a model to imitate.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s  Labour government  – which has been hounded by the  populist Reform UK party  over its struggle to control  illegal immigration  – has been so impressed by the Danish model that it sent officials to find out how the system works.\n \n\n   \n  Announcing a  radical overhaul  of Britain’s asylum system on Monday, Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, said while Britain had “held rigidly to the old model, other countries have tightened theirs.” She singled out Denmark as a poster child.\n \n\n   \n  The old model referenced by Mahmood is a creature of Europe’s post-war milieu. The United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951 applied only to Europe and sought to settle wartime refugees – primarily Jews who survived the Holocaust, ethnic Germans expelled from Eastern Europe and dissidents fleeing Soviet regimes. The treaty was expanded in 1967 to apply universally, in part to atone for colonialism.\n \n\n   \n  But the proliferation of conflict and climate disasters – coupled with cheap travel, rising rates of literacy, and the ease of online communication – has put immense strain on the post-war architecture of asylum. At the end of last year, 123 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced according to the UN, up from about 44 million people in 2010. “Our asylum system was not designed to cope with this,” Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said bluntly Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Britain is now poised to embark on a policy route first charted by Denmark a decade ago. In 2015, Europe received its most requests for asylum in a single year since World War II, as civil wars in  Syria  and Libya helped spur around 1.3 million people to travel to the region, mostly from the Middle East. When Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said “Wir schaffen das (We can do it)!” urging Germans to  welcome in refugees , Denmark took a different approach.\n \n\n   \n  Under Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Frederiksen’s predecessor as prime minister who then led the center-right Venstre party, Denmark aimed to reduce the number of asylum seekers, improve integration, and swiftly deport those who arrived illegally.\n \n\n   \n  Rasmussen, who is now the foreign minister, first made refugee status temporary, not permanent. Before 2015, refugees could stay in Denmark for five years, after which their residence permits would automatically become permanent. Now, residence permits last for only one or two years, and refugees must wait for eight years before they can apply for permanent status. Even then, it is not guaranteed: Refugees must be fluent in Danish and have held a full-time job for several years.\n \n\n   \n  Denmark has also made it harder for refugees to be joined by family members. Both must be aged 24 and above and have passed a Danish language test. The refugee must not have claimed government benefits for the past three years, and they must also put up a financial guarantee.\n \n\n   \n  Michala Clante Bendixen, head of the refugee advisory group Refugees Welcome Denmark, said removing the assumption that refugee status will become permanent has been detrimental to integration.\n \n\n   \n  “Attachment to the labor market, learning the language and understanding the society – these are very important things for successful integration,” Bendixen told CNN. But she feared the tightened requirements had “set the bar too high” for many new arrivals, discouraging some from trying at all – particularly older people with lower levels of education.\n \n\n   \n  “It creates a feeling of hopelessness. I’ve met so many refugees who say, ‘No matter what we do, it’s never good enough. I have done everything they require of me, and still it’s not enough,’” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Denmark has also been criticized for its policy on “ghettos” (now termed “parallel societies”), which allows the state to sell off or demolish housing estates where more than 50% of residents are from “non-Western” backgrounds. Successive Danish governments had worried about poor levels of integration in certain neighborhoods. In 2004, then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned of areas where “the men are unemployed, the women are isolated, and the families speak only the language of their home country.”\n \n\n   \n  A charitable interpretation of the “ghetto” law, introduced in 2018, is that it supports integration by encouraging people from different backgrounds to live together, not merely side-by-side. But not everyone is convinced. In February, a senior adviser to the EU’s top court said the policy amounts to discrimination based on ethnic origin.\n \n\n   \n  Other laws have also been criticized by human rights groups. Under the so-called “jewelry law,” authorities can seize assets worth over 10,000 Danish Krone (around $1,500) to help cover the cost of asylum support. The measure was only applied 17 times over its first six years, but still has dark historical resonances, with some drawing comparisons to confiscations of valuables by the Nazi regime.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Performative cruelty’\n \n\n   \n  Few dispute that Denmark’s policies have achieved their stated aim. In 2014, Denmark granted refugee status to 6,031 people. By 2019, that figure had dropped to 1,737.\n \n\n   \n  While Denmark grants far more residence permits today than it did 30 years ago, the vast majority of these go to students and workers, not refugees. Of the 99,811 residence permits Denmark granted last year, just 859 went to asylum seekers – less than 1%.\n \n\n   \n  “Denmark in recent decades has shown that it is politically and practically feasible to transition to a system of overall higher migration, and more employment- and education-intensive immigration,” according to a report last month from Bruegel, a Brussels-based economic think tank.\n \n\n   \n  Over time, this has deterred refugees from seeking asylum in Denmark. Britain’s Home Office said Denmark’s policies had reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the removal of 95% of those whose claims are rejected. In 2024, there were four new asylum claims per 10,000 people in Denmark, compared to 16 per 10,000 in Britain, and 20 per 20,000 for the European Union as a whole.\n \n\n   \n  Although the Danish model has won the Social Democrats praise abroad, some are growing disillusioned at home. In local elections Tuesday, Frederiksen’s party lost control of Copenhagen for the first time in more than a century. While much of the discontent is over the capital’s high housing costs, analysts say the party’s hardline stance on immigration has alienated its more progressive urban base.\n \n\n   \n  Whether the Danish model can be imported wholesale by other governments remains to be seen. Britain plans to quadruple the wait for permanent settlement from five years to 20 – much longer than the eight-year wait for refugees in Denmark. A refugee’s status will be reviewed every two-and-a-half years; if their home country is deemed to have become safe during that time, they will be deported. Those seeking asylum could also be stripped of assets including jewelry to cover the costs of their accommodation.\n \n\n   \n  Bendixen warned the new 20-year path to permanent settlement would destroy refugees’ sense of the future and make them “feel like they are second class citizens forever.”\n \n\n   \n  “Integration fails when you give young people the feeling that they don’t belong. That’s where you see gangs and crime and areas where people have their own rules. That’s because they don’t feel like they’re part of society. A rule like this would make (that feeling) much, much stronger,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Many UK Labour Party politicians would agree. Although Starmer, like Frederiksen, insists that a more stringent asylum system is compatible with the progressive values of compassion and tolerance, others say the proposals are needlessly cruel and will not have the desired effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Plans to leave refugees in a state of perpetual uncertainty about where and if they can rebuild their lives are not just performative cruelty, they are counterproductive to integration and the economy,” Stella Creasy, a Labour MP, said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Alf Dubs, a Labour member of the House of Lords who came to Britain on the Kindertransport in 1939 fleeing the persecution of Jews in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, told the BBC that he was “depressed” by Labour’s hardline turn, and called the new measures “a shabby thing.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/north-carolina-charlotte-ice-raids-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-05:00","title":"As immigration enforcement expands in North Carolina, New Orleans may be next.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rheba Hamilton was sipping coffee   on her porch Saturday morning as she watched the two workers she‘d hired begin    draping her front yard tree with lights in a quiet Charlotte, North Carolina, neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Suddenly, a gray minivan – doors already ajar –  made a sharp stop at the corner . Two federal   agents emerged and asked the landscapers for their papers. Hamilton joined the men on the lawn and started recording. Shortly after, the agents retreated.\n \n\n   \n  The abruptness of the incident took Hamilton by surprise,  mirroring the shock local officials and residents  felt as Charlotte became the latest city caught up this year in a string of targeted immigration actions.\n \n\n   \n  What began in Charlotte quickly spread to other cities in the state as the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown continues to expand nationally.  Gregory Bovino , the top Border Patrol official charged with enforcement operations, is expected to head to New Orleans in coming weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Here is where things stand:\n \n\n   \n    Next city to be targeted may already be in enforcement crackdown’s sights\n \n\n   \n  While the spotlight has been focused on North Carolina’s most populated city, immigration enforcement action has started to spread to other areas of the state and is expected to reach New Orleans within weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino – who for many has become the face of the crackdown – is expected to arrive in New Orleans the first week of December, according to two sources familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year his administration was “making a determination.”\n \n\n   \n  As immigration enforcement is expected to spread further throughout the South, Customs and Border Protection agents  were seen Tuesday in North Carolina’s Wake and Durham counties , Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said during a City Council meeting. The counties are home to Raleigh and Durham, two of the state’s other major cities and part of the Research Triangle, with Chapel Hill. .\n \n\n   \n  “We are just encouraging everyone, if you feel unsafe or you see something that you think is illegal, to please call the Raleigh Police Department or your local jurisdiction and to stay safe,” Cowell said.\n \n\n   \n  Residents of Cary, North Carolina, west of Raleigh, have  also reported seeing federal agents  at hospitals, restaurants and construction sites, Mayor Harold Weinbrecht told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters  gathered at Moore Square in downtown Raleigh  on Tuesday night, holding American flags and signs printed with slogans like, “No fear no hate, no ICE in our state” and “Respect due process,” aerial footage from CNN affiliate WRAL shows.\n \n\n   \n    DHS arrests more than 200 people in Charlotte\n \n\n   \n  Over  200 people have been arrested  in immigration raids in Charlotte over the last three days, the Department of Homeland Security said in an update Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, 44 people of the over 130 people the agency arrested had criminal record﻿s, it said. It was not clear if those records were for charges or convictions. CNN has reached out to the department for updated numbers.\n \n\n   \n  “Criminal records of those arrested include known gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony,” a Tuesday DHS statement said.\n \n\n   \n  DHS Secretary Kristi Noem  said Tuesday  the Charlotte operation was based on previous investigative work, specifically citing “a high number of child abuse, trafficking, neglect type of instances that we had identified over our work there.”\n \n\n   \n  Two men were also  federally charged in Charlotte  for allegedly using their vehicles in separate incidents to assault federal officers who were conducting immigration enforcement, the US Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina announced Tuesday. The charges don’t stem from protests in the area, the US attorney said.\n \n\n   \n    Charlotte community takes some tips from Chicago\n \n\n   \n  While the targeted immigration raids were unexpected to many of those in the Charlotte community, they were ready to meet the moment.\n \n\n   \n  People throughout Charlotte  were seen Monday  using many of the tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights.\n \n\n   \n  Their vigilance comes as many businesses across the city have closed their doors, fearing their customers will be a target. About  half the mom-and-pop businesses  the community development organization  CharlotteEast  works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.\n \n\n   \n  A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear   chased and tackled people outside the shop. A program for immigrant and refugee children  was also suspended until further notice  Monday after Border Patrol was active at their site.\n \n\n   \n  A local laundromat is taking a different approach, with  the owner locking their doors  while customers are inside in an attempt to keep them safe.\n \n\n   \n  “People are just here peacefully trying to do their laundry, trying to do their chores and daily activities,” said owner David Rebolloso. “I know these folks as my customers, and I’m familiar with their stories, and I know them, and I’m pretty certain they’re not … criminals. They’re only here to make a living and try to get by.”\n \n\n   \n    About 20% of students absent from Charlotte-area schools Monday\n \n\n   \n  More than  30,000 students were absent  from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment. CNN has reached out to the district to see how attendance was affected Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The district  issued a statement Sunday night  that no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and that leaders   hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS follows all federal and state laws protecting students’ right to a public education. The U.S. Supreme Court guarantees that all children, regardless of immigration status, have the right to attend public school,” CMS Assistant Communications Officer Tom Miner said in a statement to school district families.\n \n\n   \n  High school students in the district  staged a walkout Tuesday morning  to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, an aerial Getty photo of the demonstration showed.\n \n\n   \n    North Carolina governor and local leaders denounce the raids\n \n\n   \n  Many Democratic leaders across North Carolina have denounced the raids.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve reached out to the White House,”  North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said Tuesday.  “We haven’t gotten any word. We’re not hearing directly from Customs and Border Patrol, so we don’t know for sure where they’re going, how long they’ll be here, where else they’re going.”\n \n\n   \n  Stein went on to criticize the tactics used by federal agents, saying they are “not promoting safety in our communities.”\n \n\n   \n  In the county where Charlotte is located,   the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday to affirm constitutional protections and express support for the immigrant community.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not an issue of policy. This is an issue of morality,” Chair Mark Jerrell said. “It’s immoral to profile, to tear families apart. It’s not right to have people living in fear … This board declared tonight that we don’t condone it. We won’t stand for it.”\n \n\n   \n  While the governor and local leaders vocally oppose the federal action, North Carolina’s Republican Party  praised the immigration enforcement  operation, saying “the need is real.”\n \n\n   \n  Though some people are overwhelmed with the intensity of the moment, Councilmember LaWana Mayfield  said during a City Council committee meeting Monday  that this moment is “an opportunity to show up for each other.”\n \n\n   \n  “Get to know your neighbors, get their phone numbers, go to their back door, bring them over to your house so the children can feel safe, let the kids play together, because they don’t need to be going through all of this,” Mayfield said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/sport/curacao-football-world-cup-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"04:31:00-05:00","title":"Curaçao Makes History as Smallest Nation by Population to Qualify for a World Cup","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Curaçao, with a population of 156,115, made history by becoming the smallest nation by population to qualify for the World Cup, achieving this through a 0-0 draw with Jamaica.

engineer the vote that ‘ripped MAGA apart’ \n       \n  By Edward-Isaac Dovere, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The House vote  to release the Jeffrey Epstein files  was, in the end, 427-1. That’s a margin typically reserved for proclamations and post office namings, not for what was  perhaps the biggest defeat  of President Donald Trump’s second term, a fight that GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene declared on Tuesday had “ripped MAGA apart.”\n \n\n   \n  A group of Epstein’s survivors, sitting together in one section of the House gallery, applauded. Democrats applauded. Some Republicans applauded. No one seemed to say much to Rep. Ro Khanna as he stood in the center of the floor, toward the front, chitchatting with colleagues. When Illinois Rep. Joshua Jackson patted Khanna on the back a moment later, it wasn’t clear if he was acknowledging Khanna’s work or just trying to squeeze by to get to someone on the other side.\n \n\n   \n  That morning, Khanna had noticed that Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, his Republican co-sponsor on  the discharge petition leading to Tuesday’s vote , were trending on X and he wasn’t. He is trying to be fine with that, as playing down the Democratic role to woo Republican support was always part of the plan. He offered a “Schoolhouse Rock”-like optimism about legislating, saying, “It feels like you can make a difference in Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  But Khanna doesn’t hide his belief that Tuesday’s triumph proves he should be taken seriously as a party leader and maybe even for the long-shot 2028 presidential run he is always happy to talk about. He argues the vote vindicates the value of his long relationships with Republicans – he and Massie connected years ago working on  legislation to halt US military support to Saudi Arabia  for its war in Yemen – and his willingness to talk to almost any party.\n \n\n   \n  “I make no secret about wanting to be part of shaping the national future of the Democratic Party of this country. I make no secret about the fact that I believe I have the best economic vision for this nation,” he said in an interview with CNN before the vote, ticking through his emphasis on forgotten communities abandoned by billionaires he says have rigged the system.\n \n\n   \n  “The knock on me from some — I mean, there are many knocks on me — but one of the knocks on me has always been: ‘Okay, Ro, you can write books on this, you can write op-eds on this, but can you really, brass tacks, get things done?’ And it’s easier if you’re a mayor or a governor or a Cabinet member to show you can get things done. And what this is showing is, you know what? On one of the biggest things, which is getting MAGA on board, it’s not just ideas. I’m able to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n  Others are willing to give him credit too.\n \n\n   \n  “It took him on his side and me on my side, and our working relationship before this, to be able to do this,” Massie said after finishing thanking the survivors at their press conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning. “Our chance of success was about 4 percent at the beginning, and we’re going to succeed. So I am a little bit surprised. I’m used to fighting battles and not winning.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think Ro Khanna is a brilliant human being. I think he stands for justice. He’s on the right side of history,” said Haley Robson, an Epstein survivor helping organize the trembling “sister survivors” who tend to arrive holding up pictures of themselves when they first met Epstein, speaking to CNN after the vote. “If it wasn’t for Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ro Khanna, I don’t think any of this would have been possible. They are just incredible people who genuinely care.”\n \n\n   \n    How he strategized\n \n\n   \n  Khanna, a 47-year-old who represents Silicon Valley, has gotten used to often getting a better reception as the token Democrat on right-wing media than he does from some of his colleagues. This time, he’d like a little more credit for being ahead of the curve.\n \n\n   \n  “In the beginning,” he told CNN, “I’m not going to say who, but some of the folks in our own party were like, eyerolls, ‘There goes Ro on one of his issues…’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of eggs?’ ‘Why aren’t we talking about the price of health care?’ ‘What’s up with this?’ And I said, ‘No, there is something legitimate here.’”\n \n\n   \n  That included building a relationship with Greene, whom he said he barely knew before – but had never blasted on Twitter like so many of his colleagues – and now texts with. Or carefully maneuvering how to get Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert in September to sign the discharge petition that forced the vote. Massie relayed that she’d do it if she didn’t have to wait in line, so Khanna pulled the paper away from a Democratic colleague on the House floor and let her walk over and do it.\n \n\n   \n  To report about Khanna is to inspire exasperation from political journalists and operatives who’ve rued for years how many stories the congressman always manages to put himself into as the hinge point.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s also to hear from a person who speaks to Barack Obama often that the former president keeps an eye on Khanna as an administration alumnus (Khanna was a deputy assistant commerce secretary in the first term, before launching a primary against an incumbent whom Obama endorsed). Without overstating it, the person said, Obama “appreciates that Ro is willing to show up across all varieties of platforms.”\n \n\n   \n  That gives Khanna a phone full of contacts to promote himself and his ideas, from MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon to forever never-Trumper Bill Kristol to  Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president whom Khanna is now disgusted to think he was on the phone with arguing about economic policy just weeks ago. The batch of Epstein estate emails  released last week revealed Summers had been asking Epstein for advice  on how to sleep with a mentee of his until just before Epstein’s final arrest.\n \n\n   \n  “If there was no media attention to this,” Khanna said, “this thing would never have gotten a vote. So the idea of politicians being ambitious to raise issues they care about to the American public is a good thing, if the ambition is for a good public purpose. This idea that we should not be savvy about getting our message out in the media is setting us up for being ineffective.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who voted for and touted the win, didn’t respond when asked what the Democratic leader made of Khanna’s pushing the bill through.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Bacon, the retiring Nebraska Republican who’s become friendly with Khanna through their subcommittee work, argued Republicans always wanted to release the files, despite Speaker Mike Johnson in a floor speech on Tuesday calling the vote a distraction from “urgent legislative work.”\n \n\n   \n  “It could have been anybody” leading the charge, Bacon said. Then he reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  “He was smart enough to get on it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Anger and regrets\n \n\n   \n  At first, Khanna says, he took up the Epstein files cause because it was another way of sticking it to the elite class, the ones he travels the country talking about under his “economic patriotism” umbrella for shipping out their jobs and selling out their communities. But he was changed by what he calls the “emotionally horrific” meetings with survivors who started to come through his office — the guilt of having recruited friends, the trauma of being coerced, the women breaking down about how they’ve blocked memories of their own rapes and wanting the records of what happened so they can at least reclaim their own experiences.\n \n\n   \n  He should have listened sooner, he said Tuesday. He shouldn’t have let it slide when he says he brought up releasing the Epstein files with former Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democrat and House Oversight chair who died in 2019. He shouldn’t have waited until Trump’s backing off his promise to release them got him going in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  “Had I met the survivors in 2019 or 2020,” Khanna told CNN. “I would have been more vocal in the Biden administration. I think it is a fair point that all of us should have been more vocal earlier.”\n \n\n   \n  Khanna’s father taught him to be stoic, he said, so tears don’t tend to flow, but the anger does. This was insidious, he felt, “a rottenness in our civilization that allowed this to happen — like, how are we allowing these people to get away with this stuff?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This wasn’t about billionaires rigging the system, Khanna started to say. Men so rich and powerful and interconnected that they had means and the gall for a “rape island” and then to try to intimidate away any consequences represented something more: This, he argues, was about “the Epstein class.”\n \n\n   \n    A ‘proof of concept’\n \n\n   \n  Khanna doesn’t know if he’ll be invited to the bill signing Trump is now promising. He hasn’t talked to the president since January 6, 2021, not that their relationship was ever much more than hellos at first-term bill signings and one chat in the Oval Office about a new term-limits law. He thinks Trump won’t be able to wiggle out of his promise, or of complying, and believes there are too many survivors’ lawyers and former Justice officials who’ve seen the files to know if they get selectively scrubbed.\n \n\n   \n  Khanna is already talking to Greene about joining together to try to ban private equity firms from buying up single-family homes. He wonders if he can get a few Republicans to extend Medicare to people starting at 55, even though he still favors Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All. Cutting defense budgets seems to have some crossover appeal. Maybe they can come up with a billionaire’s tax that they’ll say is all about taking on the Epstein class.\n \n\n   \n  “My point is, if your goal is just, ‘How do Democrats win,’ maybe anti-Trump is enough for a moment. If your goal is, ‘How do we build an enduring majority, which is what progressive Democrats like me want to do?’ This is absolutely essential,” Khanna said. “This is a proof of concept that we need to actually figure out how we bring disaffected MAGA voters into our coalition, that we need to focus much more on railing against a system that has screwed Americans and offering a hopeful message about how we help them, more than just meme-ing against Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/us/chkhikvishvili-neo-nazi-nyc-guilty-plea-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"04:10:00-05:00","title":"Neo-Nazi leader behind plot to give poisoned candy to Jewish kids in NYC pleads guilty","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Michail Chkhikvishvili, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi from Georgia known as 'Commander Butcher,' pleaded guilty in Brooklyn to soliciting hate crimes and promoting violent attacks against Jews and racial minorities.

EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Melania Trump will join second lady Usha Vance Wednesday for a pre-Thanksgiving visit with North Carolina military families Wednesday, offering the latest signal that the first lady is more actively engaging with her role after a quiet start to her second term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Vance are expected to participate in engagements with service members and their families at Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River. They will also deliver formal remarks at an aircraft hangar, according to the first lady’s office, and “show appreciation for those who serve this holiday season.”\n \n\n   \n  The North Carolina trip will mark their first public joint appearance without their husbands 10 months into the Trump-Vance administration.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how much the two women have substantively engaged with each other behind the scenes, though the Vances hosted the Trumps at the Naval Observatory for dinner last month, spending about an hour and a half at the vice presidential residence. The first lady’s office declined to respond to CNN’s inquiries about their relationship.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, a  former high-powered lawyer , is navigating the delicate dynamic of being a top figurehead in a new administration alongside the first lady, who has taken  her own approach  to the spousal role.\n \n\n   \n  The second lady has joined her husband on key trips across the country and abroad as she has quietly promoted a cause of children’s literacy, all while transitioning three small children to a life under the microscope.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, took a more hands-off approach to her role, spending most of her time in the first months of the president’s second term away from the White House in New York or Palm Beach, Florida, often disappearing for weeks between public appearances.\n \n\n   \n  She has a much smaller staff compared with her first term. Though she was an active steward of White House preservation during her husband’s first term, she has left many of those decision to the president this time around,  culminating dramatically  last month with the demolition of  the East Wing , which has served as headquarters for presidential spouses since the Carter administration.\n \n\n   \n  But recently, the first lady has returned to public view with a series of engagements on a range of topics.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has held events advocating for children’s well-being and artificial intelligence safety, launching a  global coalition  on the issue called “Fostering the Future Together.” She joined the president as he signed an executive order last week on a (unrelated) “Fostering the Future” initiative for children in foster care. And she back-channeled with Russian President Vladimir Putin on releasing allegedly abducted Ukrainian children with  mixed results .\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear why the first lady is choosing to reemerge now, and her office declined to respond to questions on whether this might portend a more active role.

comments escalates \n       \n  By Jerome Taylor, Ross Adkin, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:04 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   China  has warned there is “no market” for  Japanese seafood exports,  the latest veiled threat from Beijing as its diplomatic spat with Tokyo escalates over recent comments by Japan’s leader on defending Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  The two neighbors have been engaged in a  rapidly spiraling dispute  after Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi, in response to a question in parliament, said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival,” and thus could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan’s sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a week, China and its state media has issued near daily denunciations of Takaichi   as well as threats to economically punish Tokyo unless the comments are retracted.\n \n\n   \n  Seafood emerged as the latest pressure point at a regular press briefing on Wednesday from China’s foreign ministry.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the erroneous remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on important Taiwan issues, there has been strong public outrage in China,” spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters. “Under the current circumstances, even if Japanese seafood were exported to China, there would be no market for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Mao was responding to reports earlier that day in Japanese media that China had already informed Tokyo that it planned to ban seafood exports from Japan. Both NHK and Kyodo ran the reports, citing sources.\n \n\n   \n  However Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters Tokyo has yet to receive any confirmation from the Chinese government on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Mao’s response did not confirm a ban was in place, but it has raised the prospect that one might be on its way as well as further punitive measures.\n \n\n   \n  “Japan should first retract its erroneous remarks and take concrete actions to safeguard the political foundation of China-Japan relations; otherwise, China will have no choice but to take further measures,” Mao said.\n \n\n   \n    Fukhshima era ban\n \n\n   \n  China had only  partly resumed imports  of seafood from Japan earlier this year after banning them in August 2023 in response to Tokyo’s decision to begin releasing treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused water within the plant to be contaminated with highly radioactive material. Tokyo had argued that it had treated the water properly, but Beijing had long led regional opposition to the water being returned to the ocean.\n \n\n   \n  The threat of a new   seafood ban comes after Beijing last week advised its citizens against travelling to Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Although the move is non-binding, it is hugely symbolic – nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern later published notices on their websites offering customers refunds or free changes on certain tickets to Japan, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  Japanese companies are starting to report cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  Tokyo-based tour operator East Japan International Travel Service said it had lost 70% of its bookings for the remainder of the year, because of the ongoing row between Japan and China.\n \n\n   \n  Yu Jinxin, the company’s vice president, told CNN it was “a huge loss for us”, adding Chinese tour groups are a key part of their business.\n \n\n   \n  “We can withstand a short-term impact of one to two months, but if the situation becomes prolonged, the financial strain on our operations will be significant,” Yu added.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response to avoid ruffling feathers in China – Japan’s biggest trade partner.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi,  a hawk who has pushed to strengthen Japan’s defense capacity,  visited Taiwan earlier this year – before she became Prime Minister – and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time.\n \n\n   \n  She has previously criticized Beijing’s increasing military presence in East Asia, and during the APEC summit, she met with Taiwan’s representative, again angering China.\n \n\n   \n  She met Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the same summit, at which she said she had asked China to resume imports of Japanese beef and seafood imports.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Mai Takiguchi and Kloe Zheng contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/entertainment/nicki-minaj-speech-nigeria","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:36:00-05:00","title":"Nicki Minaj’s Diplomatic Moment, Explained","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nicki Minaj addressed a public gathering in New York to spotlight the alleged persecution of Christians in Nigeria, a topic previously raised by U.S. President Donald Trump, who suggested military action and aid cuts.

She then said it was “an honor” to be present “to shine a spotlight on the deadly threats faced by thousands of Christians in Nigeria.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stand here as a proud New Yorker with a deep sense of gratitude that we live in a country where we can freely and safely worship God regardless of one’s creed, background, or politics,” she said. “No group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion, like I recently stated on social media. And we don’t have to share the same beliefs in order for us to respect each other.”\n \n\n   \n  The US president  recently sparked alarm in Nigeria  after he said he was considering military action there and would cease aid over what he claimed was the Nigerian government’s failure to protect Christians from a  “mass slaughter” by Islamist insurgents in the African nation.\n \n\n   \n  Experts have said the situation is  more nuanced than presented by the US president , with both Christians and Muslims being victims of violence by Islamic extremists.\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government also rejected Trump’s comments. “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Calling Nigeria “a beautiful nation with deep faith traditions,” Minaj noted in her address on Tuesday that some of her devoted fanbase, known as the Barbz, live there.\n \n\n   \n  “I am joined here today by peace builders, by faith leaders, by those who saw violence, saw intolerance, saw the threats clearly before us and chose not to look the other way,” Minaj said. “I am inspired by their work to build interfaith ties, to see the humanity across the lines which might divide us and to vie and to fight for security and liberty for all those who pray.”\n \n\n   \n  Waltz shared how Minaj’s invitation to speak at the US mission in New York came about in an interview on Fox News on Tuesday morning, saying she was asked to speak after expressing support of a Truth Social post from Trump in connection with the Nigeria issue. “To our astonishment, she accepted,” Waltz said. “She is reaching a whole other swath of people who may not follow these issues, and it’s going to be a great day.”\n \n\n   \n  Waltz  wrote earlier this week  that the rapper “is not only arguably the greatest female recording artist, but also a principled individual who refuses to remain silent in the face of injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m grateful she’s leveraging her massive platform to spotlight the atrocities against Christians in Nigeria, and I look forward to standing with her as we discuss the steps the President and his administration are taking to end the persecution of our Christian brothers and sisters,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Minaj  posted about her gratitude  for the invitation on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Ambassador, I am so grateful to be entrusted with an opportunity of this magnitude,” she wrote. “I do not take it for granted.

month after a judge ordered she not be removed to the country over fears she may be tortured or violently persecuted.\n \n\n   \n  The government has said it will allow Britania Uriostegui Rios, a Mexican national,   to return to the US if she is able to make it to the border. Once she has returned, she will be placed back in ICE custody while the administration tries to deport her to a different country,   court documents show.\n \n\n   \n  The case marks the latest example of the Trump administration wrongfully removing someone protected by court orders or special status as it works to carry out the president’s goal of a  history-making  mass deportation program. Uriostegui Rios is  at least the fifth  such case this year, including the administration’s  dramatic legal showdown  over the removal – and  eventual return  – of Salvadoran man Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n \n\n   \n  Uriostegui Rios’s attorneys are suing the administration and demanding that she not be required to return to federal custody once she is back in the US – “if she happens to make it to a port of entry without dying.”\n \n\n   \n  Mexico is one of the deadliest countries in the world for transgender people, according to the  Trans Murder Monitoring Project . Though the full scope of risk to transgender people in Mexico is unclear, journalists and advocacy groups  have documented  pervasive – and  often fatal  – violence.\n \n\n   \n  Since entering the US in 2003, Uriostegui Rios has racked up a lengthy criminal history that includes convictions for disorderly conduct, sexual solicitation and DUI, according to  court filings  from a Department of Homeland Security official.\n \n\n   \n  An immigration judge  ordered her deportation  in March after she was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in Las Vegas.\n \n\n   \n  But the judge simultaneously blocked the government from removing Uriostegui Rios to her native Mexico, finding there was a likelihood she could face “torture” there.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Uriostegui Rios was flown from a detention center in Louisiana to Texas on November 11, where her attorneys say she was taken across the border to Mexico without money, her daily medications or a cell phone.

court at Crypto.com Arena Tuesday night to begin his 23rd season in the NBA, the 40-year-old added yet another record to his illustrious resumé – the longest career in league history.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Tuesday, James shared the accolade with Vince Carter, who played 22 NBA seasons from 1998 to 2000.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just fun to be out there with the guys, man. It’s been rough mentally for me,” the four-time NBA champion said after the game, “this is the first time I’ve started a basketball season and not played since I’ve started playing basketball, like nine years old, I’ve never missed the beginning of a basketball season.”\n \n\n   \n  Sporting his famed No. 23 jersey, James was on the hardwood for the opening tip against the Utah Jazz.\n \n\n   \n  The public address announcer in the arena announced James’ achievement to a short ovation from the Lakers’ faithful during the first quarter. The future Hall of Famer acknowledged the crowd with a wave.\n \n\n   \n  The Lakers got off to a slow start, trailing by as many as 11 points early on. James was held scoreless in the opening quarter of play as the Jazz led 36-27 after 12 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  James knocked down a three-pointer from the wing early in the second quarter for the first points of his historic season.\n \n\n   \n  As James heated up, so did the Lakers team. Los Angeles closed the gap in the second quarter and pulled away in the second half, winning comfortably, 140-125.\n \n\n   \n  James finished with a double-double, scoring 11 points and dishing out 12 assists in the game. The 21-time All-Star has now scored in double digits in a mind-boggling 1,293 consecutive games played.\n \n\n   \n  Lakers coach JJ Redick said postgame: “Just thought he played with the right spirit. Very unselfish all night. Was a willing passer, didn’t force it, took his drives and his shots when they were there.\n \n\n   \n  “The defense is going to pay attention to him, particularly when he has the ball in the post, particularly when he’s putting pressure on the rim, and I just thought he made a lot of great decisions tonight. Really good to have him back.”\n \n\n   \n  The 21-time All-Star played 30 minutes in the game, on par with the rest of the LA’s starters as the Lakers eased him back into action. James had been concerned about his stamina ahead of Tuesday’s season debut.\n \n\n   \n  “The pace tested me, but I was happy with the way I was able to go with the guys. As the game went on, my wind got a lot better. Caught my second wind, caught my third wind,” James said. “Rhythm is still coming back, obviously. First game in almost seven months, so everything that happened tonight was to be expected.”\n \n\n   \n  James missed the Lakers’ first 14 games of the 2025-26 campaign due to sciatica – a nerve issue causing pain that originates in the spine and radiates down the back of the leg.\n \n\n   \n  The  NBA’s all-time leading scorer  returned to Lakers’ practice this week after being absent from the team since the opening of training camp in early October due to what head coach JJ Redick said is a nerve irritation in his glute.\n \n\n   \n  Retirement rumors swirled around James over the course of the past year, but in June, the four-time league MVP reportedly picked up his $52.6 million option to return for an eighth season with the Lakers.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, playing in his record-tying 22nd season, James continued to display astounding productivity, averaging 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists while appearing in 70 games.\n \n\n   \n  James had scored a record 42,184 regular-season points and 50,473 with the regular season and playoffs combined ahead of Tuesday night’s debut.\n \n\n   \n  The Akron, Ohio, native entered the NBA to much fanfare as an 18-year-old after being selected No. 1 in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers.

    12:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s…not Superman?\n \n\n   \n  No, it’s Super Mustache, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro’s cartoon alter-ego, here to save the South American country from peril. \n \n\n   \n  “ Super Mustache ,” which has aired on Venezuelan state TV since 2021, is just one piece of the country’s propaganda push as  US warships amass  near the Venezuelan coast and US President Donald Trump  muses  about sending troops to depose Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  In  a September episode  of “Super Mustache,” aired shortly after Trump began his campaign of airstrikes on alleged drug boats off the Venezuelan coast, the cartoon superhero doffed his usual costume in favor of a military uniform, wielding a  sheathed sword  and declaring that Venezuela doesn’t have a “warmongering culture.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet despite Super Mustache’s new look, the Venezuelan government has sent mixed messages since tensions increased with the US, simultaneously urging citizens to prepare for action while insisting that everything is fine.\n \n\n   \n  The dissonance between the gravity of the crisis in the Caribbean and the regime’s messaging is visible on the streets of Caracas. Unlike in previous nationwide campaigns, CNN teams in Venezuela have not seen any billboards, banners, murals, or graffiti in the national capital calling for support for the regime’s war footing, even in neighborhoods considered government strongholds.\n \n\n   \n     Different strategies \n \n\n   \n  Maduro, who prior to August was more commonly seen in enclosed spaces, has been making speeches and public appearances almost daily since tensions began to rise with the United States, often seen surrounded by a significant security detail, according to Venezuelan researcher and journalist Andrés Cañizález.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro hasn’t taken on the job of projecting Venezuela’s military might in the face of Trump’s threats. He has instead portrayed himself as a peacemaker, even  singing John Lennon’s song “Imagine”  at a public event, urging Trump to come to the table for talks face-to-face. As he waded through the crowd at a rally on November 13, Maduro  told  CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon that the US should unite with Venezuela for peace in the Americas.\n \n\n   \n  Cañizález believes the Maduro government’s communication strategy has gone through different stages: initially, tensions with the US were downplayed, but as the US military presence in the Caribbean increased, the discourse shifted “to a more threatening, more retaliatory tone.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro’s counterpoint in Venezuela’s propaganda machine is Diosdado Cabello, the interior minister and host of one of the country’s most popular talk shows on state TV – “ Con el Mazo Dando, ” Spanish for “Hitting it with a Club.” In a typical four-hour episode, Cabello meanders between attacking opposition politicians, telling jokes and promoting the government’s position.\n \n\n   \n  Chief among those positions is that US actions in the Caribbean have nothing to do with drugs, despite what the  Trump administration insists .\n \n\n   \n  “There are no tensions here between Venezuela and the United States. Here there is an aggression by the United States against Venezuela,” Cabello declared on his episode last week. “And the aggression has nothing to do with drugs, or terrorism, or criminal gangs, it has to do with taking control of Venezuela’s natural resources.”\n \n\n   \n  On every episode, the interior minister reads out criticisms of the Maduro government, usually from Republican politicians in the US, then responds with a recording of the late President Hugo Chavez daring the United States to try and invade Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Political scientist Javier Corrales, who often writes about Venezuelan politics, told CNN that Cabello has long cultivated an aggressive reputation as part of the regime’s old guard.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a bully,” Corrales said. “There is a certain aspect of Cabello that we recognize in other autocracies, the need to have somebody not just praising the president, butpresident but trashing the opposition - and Cabello is amazing.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Venezuela’s military has also posted numerous videos on social media showing soldiers preparing for war, usually set to dramatic music. Footage shows troops conducting shooting drills, anti-tank fortifications in Caracas, and militia members posing with weapons.\n \n\n   \n     Going easy on Trump \n \n\n   \n  Yet, in their different approaches, Maduro and Cabello share one feature: a reluctance to criticize Trump too harshly. Both men have a lot to say about US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n \n\n   \n  In Cabello’s telling, Rubio, whom the interior minister often calls “the Crazy Cuban,” is intent on leading a reluctant Trump to declare war on Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “This move to seek a change of government in Venezuela isn’t even to satisfy the interests of…Trump or MAGA, but rather those of Rubio and the Cuban American mafia,” Cabello announced to his live studio audience during last week’s episode.\n \n\n   \n  Corrales explained that Rubio is a perfect foil for the Maduro regime, being perhaps the most prominent critic of Latin American leftism in the US government. The secretary’s Cuban heritage and Florida origins also provide fodder for Cabello, who often claims that Rubio is aiming to please an electorate of anti-communist Cuban exiles in Miami.\n \n\n   \n  Cañizález told CNN that while Trump might be criticized, Rubio is a useful “external enemy” for the regime’s most loyal supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio “is presented as the direct enemy of the revolution,” Cañizález said. “This tactic seeks to sow divisions in US domestic politics and reinforce the idea of a personalized external enemy, useful for uniting the Chavista base.”\n \n\n   \n  Even after Trump ordered strikes on alleged drug boats directly off the Venezuelan coast in September, Cabello claimed in his show on September 3   that Rubio is “leading Trump to the slaughter, because Rubio is trying to fracture Trump’s MAGA base and…sell himself as a new hawk within the Republican Party.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the US State Department about Cabello’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  Even   though Cabello often talks about preparing for all scenarios, including possible military conflict, he occasionally downplays Trump’s announced actions against Venezuela. Shortly after Trump publicly authorized the CIA to conduct covert actions in the country, Cabello mocked as ridiculous the idea that the CIA had ever been inactive in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, (the CIA) has been formally authorized to act,” Cabello said sarcastically. “It never acted here before.”\n \n\n   \n  Herein lies the dilemma for Venezuela’s leadership: mobilizing support against external enemies while avoiding the panic of a country under siege.

3:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore could be repeated across the country if recommendations aren’t followed, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The board issued 17 safety recommendations this week to prevent an accident like the one last year, where the 213-million-pound cargo vessel Dali lost engine and electrical power as it was leaving the port and struck a pillar of the Key Bridge causing it to collapse.\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB recommended Synergy Marine, the ship’s operator, use thermal imaging to find lose wires on its other vessels, make sure the right pumps are being used, and that engines won’t automatically shut down in situations like this crash.\n \n\n   \n  Other recommendations include new rules for wire labeling, a warning system for drivers crossing bridges in case of emergency, and better recoding systems to capture data on ships in case of a crash.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to see safety change, we need our recommendations implemented,” NTSB chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters after a nearly five hour public meeting. “That’s the next step. We’ve issued the safety recommendations now we need to make sure that they’re implemented, and so we will work diligently.”\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB held the public meeting Tuesday to determine the probable cause of the container ship Dali crashing into the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and its subsequent collapse, killing six people.\n \n\n   \n  The 984-feet long vessel operated in the container liner trade, carrying truck-sized boxes of cargo between Asia and the US East Coast. The bridge was owned and operated by the Maryland Transportation Authority and opened to traffic on March 23, 1977.\n \n\n   \n  The last time the bridge was inspected was in 2024 when it was given a satisfactory rating. Yet the Key Bridge had nearly 30 times the acceptable level of risk for critical bridges of collapse if it were hit, based on guidance established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the NTSB said. But no one knew that before the collapse, because the owner of the bridge, the Maryland Transportation Authority, never evaluated that risk.\n \n\n   \n  The agency says all of the blame for the bridge collapse is the fault of the ship.\n \n\n   \n  “The MDTA maintains that the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and the tragic loss of life were the sole fault of the DALI and the gross negligence of its owners and operators,” it said in a statement to CNN Tuesday.  “The Key Bridge was approved and permitted by the federal government and complied with those permits.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Synergy thanked the NTSB for its “professionalism and technical rigour” throughout this investigation and said it and Grace Ocean Investment Limited, the company that owns the ship, have cooperated fully with the board.\n \n\n   \n  “We note the Board’s findings, including its observations regarding the vulnerability of the Key Bridge’s main support pier, as well as the comments relating to aspects of the vessel’s electrical arrangements. These matters will be reviewed in detail with our technical teams, the vessel owner and counsel,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the NTSB recommended risk assessments also be conducted on 68 other bridges in 19 states spanning waterways frequented by cargo ships that, like the Key Bridge, were built before 1991 and do not have a current vulnerability assessment.\n \n\n   \n  Among those on the list are the Golden Gate Bridge in California; Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, George Washington and Verrazzano-Narrows bridges in New York City; the Walt Whitman and Benjamin Franklin bridges in Pennsylvania; the Sunshine Skyway in Florida and the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Homendy noted that despite its recommendations, some of those bridges still have not been evaluated for risk of collapse if a ship like the Dali were to hit them.\n \n\n   \n    One loose wire, among thousands\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB said Tuesday it believes the probable cause of the power outage that led to the crash was a label was put in the wrong place on a signal wire when the ship was built. That sticker, identifying the line, kept the wire from getting a good connection in a circuit breaker – which in turn ultimately caused the first blackout.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, according to Marcel Muse, the NTSB’s investigator in charge, the vessel lost steering, the ability to operate the bow thruster, key water pumps, and most of the vessel’s lighting and equipment essential for operations. That first outage lasted 58 seconds.\n \n\n   \n  There were thousands of wires on the Dali, and one loose wire would not have been easily found by the crew.\n \n\n   \n  “The Dali is almost 1,000 feet, and it’s as long as the Eiffel Tower,” Homendy said. “It’s high with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Locating a single wire that is loose among thousands of wires is like looking for a loose bolt in the Eiffel Tower.”\n \n\n   \n  The crew onboard the Dali quickly found the tripped breaker, the NTSB said. Power came back within 58 seconds, but restarting a key pump that would have provided fuel to generators had to be done manually, and that didn’t happen. When the generators ran out of gas in their lines, the result was a second blackout.\n \n\n   \n  “To restart it, you would have to go two levels down in near total darkness with a flashlight from the engine control deck to the purifier room on the fourth deck,” Homendy said.\n \n\n   \n  The pump the Dali was using was designed for maintenance and was not intended for use while the ship was underway, so there was no backup system.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of the second blackout, the Dali was just three ships’ lengths from the bridge and despite the pilots reacting properly, they couldn’t regain control in time to avoid hitting it, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  About 10 hours earlier, while the ship was still moored, it experienced two onboard blackouts, one caused by a crew error, according to the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Grace Ocean and Synergy reached  a settlement  with the Justice Department to pay nearly $102 million to resolve a civil claim alleging that the companies’ cost-cutting and negligence in the ship’s maintenance led to the disastrous collision.\n \n\n   \n  In its filing last month, the Justice Department said that the “tragedy was entirely avoidable,” pointing to alleged failures in the ship’s infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n    Black boxes didn’t give up information easily\n \n\n   \n  Investigators also encountered many issues extracting information from the vessel’s recorders, which are similar to black boxes on airplanes.\n \n\n   \n  Voyage data recorders, known as a VDRs, are electronic systems that continuously record navigational and location data, radar images, basic engine operations, alarm status, bridge audio recordings and VHF radio communications, according to the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Payne, an investigator in the NTSB’s vehicle recorder division, said during the investigation, the NTSB encountered several problems that made it hard to extract and use the data efficiently.\n \n\n   \n  “Key issues included unrecorded data during the vessel’s first underway blackout, the lack of recording of communications between the Dali’s bridge and the Dali’s engine room, the digitally destructive mixing of recorded bridge audio channels, inadequate VDR playback software, the inability to download the full data set on board the Dali, and the complex workflow for processing proprietary VDR data in the common formats,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n    Final report coming soon\n \n\n   \n  The final report on the incident will be revised and issued in several weeks and the 17 recommendations will be formally issued and finalized by the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a really big voice, and we’re not afraid to use it,” Homendy said. “While we don’t have enforcement power, certainly, we have had a lot of success with voluntary adoption of our recommendations. We’re usually at an 83% closure rate.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Michelle Watson contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/19/sport/basketball-ncaa-michigan-state-kentucky-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"12:32:00-05:00","title":"Michigan State’s dismantling of Kentucky highlights the philosophical divide in college basketball","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Michigan State defeats Kentucky 83-66 in a game that underscores a philosophical divide in college basketball: while Kentucky invests heavily in players and branding (evident in Oweh’s Amiri jacket and a $22 million roster), the team fails to translate that spending into on-court success, showing poor defense, shooting, and team cohesion.

Fabulously alliterative, but not terribly encouraging, if you’re part of the Big Blue Nation.\n \n\n   \n  That this disastrous showing comes exactly one-week after Kentucky got beat up by rival Louisville does not help.\n \n\n   \n  After that equally disappointing, disappointing and discombobulated showing Pope alluded to a mysterious pre-game locker room issue. The way he said it - “I’m not ready to tell the story yet, but at some point, we’ll talk in detail about our pregame experience at Louisville, and it was out of character for us, and that’s young and new,’’ - it did not sound like this was some rival hijinks.\n \n\n   \n  By not specifically identifying the issue - joking later he wanted to plant some Taylor Swift Easter eggs - he opened the door to frantic speculation among a fan base that does not need to be led into the deep end of paranoia where its basketball team is concerned. It happily gets there on its own.\n \n\n   \n  At least now the issue seems clearer. Bad good news, if you will. It would be insulting to say the Wildcats don’t care. Athletes care. But perhaps this crew is currently misguided in what exactly it ought to care about.\n \n\n   \n  Flanked by Oweh and Malachi Moreno, who both looked like someone stole their lunch money (or maybe their NIL money?), Pope was asked how player injuries (point guard Jaland Lowe didn’t play) might be affecting his team’s performance. A Mormon who doesn’t really curse, Pope started, “I’m going to temper my words.’’\n \n\n   \n  He then took a deep long breath. “If you build an organization, your identity isn’t about an individual person; it’s about a collective group.”\n \n\n   \n  It is perhaps unfair to take one team’s misery a handful of weeks into a season and extrapolate it into some sort of moratorium on what does and does not work in college basketball.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s almost impossible to consider what just happened on the Madison Square Garden court and not think big picture. The chasm on the scoreboard was only slightly wider than the way the two programs operate.\n \n\n   \n  Tom Izzo did not spend $22 million on his roster. He didn’t even spend $10 million.\n \n\n   \n  He has a team with players that in this era might be considered endangered species - four-year guys (Carson Cooper and Jaxon Kohler), three-year guys (Coen Carr and Fears), a redshirt (Jesse McCullough) and a four-star top 60 player who averaged 3.1 minutes per game last year and came back anyway (Kur Teng).\n \n\n   \n  Playing for Izzo is no picnic. Teng isn’t the only one who could have bolted, and who no doubt was enticed with promises of cash and playing time.\n \n\n   \n  Instead they stayed, biding their time and finding their minutes along with their purposes. Teng scored 15, Kohler 20. Cooper and Carr both yanked six rebounds and Fears did his assist thing.\n \n\n   \n  More telling, at one point on Tuesday night, during a Division I college basketball game in the year 2025, the entire bench - players, managers, staff - stood up and started clapping and chanting, ‘De-fense, de-fense,’ as if this they were playing in a church-league game.\n \n\n   \n  Comparatively Kentucky’s Collin Chandler hit a three while his team trailed by 19 with two minutes left in the game and did the inject ice into my veins move as he came down the court.\n \n\n   \n  It is only November. Nothing is decided. Kentucky could very well find its groove and Michigan State could once again forget how to shoot. Both coaches know that.\n \n\n   \n  Yet as the two teams exited the building, one left in an existential crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like the identity that we felt like we carried may have been stripped away, and that’s some reality we’re facing,’’ Pope said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s an incredibly, incredibly painful process. It’s a terrifying process. If you treat it right, it can be a galvanizing process. And that comes down to the character of your organization. I think the character of our organization is terrific and tested in a big way right. But that’s the beautiful thing about sports. You either get it done or you don’t.”\n \n\n   \n  And then there was Izzo, college basketball’s perpetual Eeyore, basking in something nearing joy and satisfaction. Izzo has not hidden his disdain for either the transfer portal or the transactional nature of college athletics.\n \n\n   \n  And so when he was asked if there’s something about having guys that stick around and stick it out, he too had to temper his remarks. He took a long beat before answering, promising to be careful with his words.\n \n\n   \n  “How about 100 frickin’ percent?” he said. “They’re homegrown and they play for the name on the front of their jersey because they know the name on the front of the jersey.’’\n \n\n   \n  He wasn’t talking about Amiri.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/texas-judge-blocks-ten-commandments-law","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:40:00-05:00","title":"Texas Judge Temporarily Blocks Law Requiring Ten Commandments in Schools","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Orlando L.

\nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Wed November 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  To paraphrase a perennial Washington question: What is the president going to release and when is he going to release it?\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump is reeling from a spectacular defeat, easily his worst from his own party on Capitol Hill during two turbulent presidencies, after every step he took to stall and deflect  the Jeffrey Epstein saga  blew up in his face.\n \n\n   \n  No one would have believed as recently as this past weekend that a bill requiring the Justice Department to release files related to the convicted sex offender would  race through the GOP Congress  with only  one vote against it  by Tuesday evening.\n \n\n   \n  But such can be the power of suddenly unleashed political justice.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump and his Attorney General Pam Bondi, who both triggered the political uproar by pledging to open the Epstein files, only to then refuse to do so, are back where they started. Only in a much more vulnerable political position.\n \n\n   \n  And they have unappetizing political choices at a moment when Trump’s presidency appears damaged,  his popularity is falling  and a crush of other intractable issues bogs down his White House. Speculation is growing about whether a president who many were recently warning was a dictator is close to becoming a lame duck.\n \n\n   \n    Vindication for victims\n \n\n   \n  The overwhelming House and Senate moves to release the Epstein files are a stunning triumph for Epstein’s victims after they became more visible earlier this summer. A president who believes he enjoys unfettered power and who disdains democracy was defeated by grassroots political campaigning in combination with a handful of courageous lawmakers from both parties.\n \n\n   \n  But Haley Robson, a survivor of Epstein’s abuse,  told CNN’s Erin Burnett  that Tuesday’s moves were not the end for women who long ago lost trust the government would protect them. “We have to be very honest with ourselves. … We do have a long road in front of us,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the pressure of the survivors’ campaign now threatens to bear down on Trump alone, after the House and the Senate moved with extraordinary speed to dump a radioactive political issue on the White House. Their pace might at least momentarily weigh on the mind of a president who was twice saved from conviction in an impeachment trial by pliant Republican senators.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most startling developments, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who’d long opposed the bill before Trump’s reversal, insisted the Senate must make changes to the bill. But senators ignored him and passed it up to the White House in an instant.\n \n\n   \n  Unless Trump and Bondi release the Epstein files immediately, the question that’s been haunting Trump for months will now become even more acute: What is he hiding?\n \n\n   \n  A bid by the DOJ to play for time — perhaps by arguing documents cannot be released because of ongoing investigations — might obstruct the hopes of survivors. But it might also mean Trump never escapes a storm that, judging by his  eruptions at reporters , is driving him to distraction. Another DOJ strategy could be to release countless pages of Epstein files but with details, names and other information blacked out to avoid incriminating people. But that would only prolong the controversy.\n \n\n   \n  There’s been no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump in relation to his former friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in prison in 2019. Trump again branded the drama a Democratic “hoax” on Tuesday. But  multiple mentions of the president  in emails sent by Epstein recently released by Congress raise the possibility that he’s also referenced in documents held by the DOJ.\n \n\n   \n  One option for Bondi could be a vast document dump that casts suspicion on multiple prominent men who victims say maintained ties to Epstein in the hope that any minor mentions of Trump might be swept away in a deluge of scandal. But as president, he’s under the harshest spotlight and would be sure to attract the most interest, even though he has said he always knew Epstein was a creep.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, Trump has turned his DOJ into an arm of his political movement. So it would not be a surprise to see partial disclosures that do not satisfy his critics. But such is the intrigue around the drama, that there is no guarantee people would believe that he’d released everything. And conspiracists who’ve obsessed about the Epstein issue will never be satisfied.\n \n\n   \n  “The next question is, will Trump use some other maneuvers in an effort to deny the information to the public that’s required by the statute?” Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch said Tuesday. “We’ll see, but I don’t trust Trump on that.”\n \n\n   \n  Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, who broke with Trump to force through the bill demanding the release of the Epstein files, warned after the vote that he would act if there was an attempt to thwart disclosure of the Epstein evidence. As a last resort, he said, he might read aloud the names of alleged associates of the accused sex trafficker in the House. But he added that was only “if we hit all of the walls — but so far, we’re making it through the walls and over the walls, and we’re getting this done.”\n \n\n   \n    What wider damage has Trump sustained?\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the difficulty of next steps for Trump, there are the questions of how much political damage he’s suffered in recent days, both within his own party and personal power base and in the country more broadly.\n \n\n   \n  Ever since returning to the White House, Trump has wielded massive power through dominance, or at least the perception that he’s all-powerful. He never followed his party; it followed him. But the myth of total power was shattered on Sunday night when he reversed his adamant position that the House should block the attempt to release the Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  The flip-flop was an attempt to defuse a looming political loss. But if his myth of omnipotence frays, it’s likely only to encourage further challenges to his authority. Of course, Trump’s instinct might be to lash out with constitutionally questionable conduct.\n \n\n   \n  This is an unusual moment for Trump. Could it presage a new phase of his presidency where the GOP does not move in lockstep on his orders? Or is the Epstein issue — which, at least to begin with, was disproportionately important to the conservative base — a one-off?\n \n\n   \n  One test might come soon for Trump over whether GOP lawmakers revolt over another matter: the expiration of enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which triggered the government shutdown. Some GOP lawmakers want to compromise with Democrats on the issue, but  the president reiterated  on Tuesday that he opposed any solution that sends more money to insurance firms.\n \n\n   \n  The US political calendar is relentless. And following larger-than-expected victories by Democrats in governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey this month, Republicans are wary about midterm elections next year. And onetime Trump ally  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s  recent attacks on Trump’s globetrotting and lack of empathy over high prices suggest that frustration with him  cuts deeper than Epstein alone .\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump is a survivor, and not just of two assassination attempts. He pulled off the greatest political comeback in history in 2024 despite a criminal conviction and after leaving power in disgrace in 2021 after refusing to accept the results of an election. No modern president has ever had such an unshakable connection with his base.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump’s most potent political strategy has been to claim he’s been persecuted. That’s not an approach that seems likely to work as he’s faced with victims of Epstein offering their testimony in public.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s rough patch\n \n\n   \n  Stunning developments on the Epstein files are not happening in isolation. It’s been a terrible few weeks for Trump. His polling numbers have slumped, especially over his handling of the economy. In another potential blow to his aura of invincibility, a federal judge this week  raised grave questions  about the viability of the DOJ’s prosecution of one of his enemies, former FBI Director James Comey.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court recently  seemed skeptical  about Trump’s tariff policy ahead of a seismic pending ruling on presidential authority. And a federal court on Tuesday  blocked Texas  from using new congressional maps drawn at the president’s behest to aid the GOP’s bid to hold on to its House majority in next year’s elections. (Texas plans to appeal to the US Supreme Court.)\n \n\n   \n  This leaves Trump needing a political rebound — a tough ask for a White House organized on the principle of the president’s infallibility and for a commander in chief who will be 80 on his next birthday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible Trump no longer controls his own political fate. Presidents often get overtaken by events in second terms — most recently George W. Bush, whose political capital was consumed by the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.\n \n\n   \n  And the symbolic might of Epstein’s long-overlooked victims has the look of a political force with unstoppable momentum.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death deprived many of his victims of justice.\n \n\n   \n  But on Tuesday, Jess Michaels, an Epstein survivor, spoke about watching House members add their votes to a 427-1 victory that she told CNN’s Jake Tapper represented a commitment not to “stay silent about powerful predators.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s no evidence of criminal conduct by Trump. But his handling of the Epstein crisis now threatens to consume his presidency.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/cloudflare-down-outage-cause","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00-05:00","title":"Why it feels like your favorite websites keep going down","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent technical outage at Cloudflare disrupted major online services such as Spotify, ChatGPT, and Truth Social, revealing the fragility of internet infrastructure.

keep going down \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:02 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Having problems with your favorite websites lately? It’s not just you.\n \n\n   \n  Web infrastructure provider Cloudflare experienced a disruption on Tuesday that temporarily impacted a swath of online services – from Spotify to ChatGPT and even President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform – marking the latest in a string of high-profile internet outages.\n \n\n   \n  An  Amazon Web Services issue  disrupted the daily routines of millions of people last month, in some cases preventing them from doing even simple tasks like ordering coffee or managing smart home appliances. Just days later,  Microsoft’s Azure service  was hit with an outage.\n \n\n   \n  According to experts, it’s a sign of the times – a combination of society’s  increased reliance on digital services , the consolidation of critical cloud infrastructure between just a few companies and the proclivity of people to complain about tech mishaps online.\n \n\n   \n  It also shows that no one, not even major tech companies, are immune to tech malfunctions.\n \n\n   \n  “It really almost doesn’t matter how well-situated the provider is in these cases, or even how sophisticated the IT organization and infrastructure is for a private business,” said Eileen Haggerty, area vice president of product and solutions marketing for IT and cybersecurity firm Netscout. Tech disruptions like these are “very, very common problems.”\n \n\n   \n    What happened at Cloudflare\n \n\n   \n  Cloudflare’s outage was the result of a technical issue, not a cyberattack or malicious behavior, the company said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The company said the outage was caused by a “configuration file” that was meant to manage “threat traffic.”\n \n\n   \n  “The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare’s services,” the statement said.   \n \n\n   \n  Dane Knecht, chief technology officer at Cloudflare, shared additional details  in a post on X  on Tuesday afternoon. In short: a routine configuration change caused a bug to crash, which “cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services.”\n \n\n   \n  “Work is already underway to make sure it does not happen again, but I know it caused real pain today,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The Amazon outage similarly  involved a bug , which kicked off when two automated systems tried to update the same data simultaneously.\n \n\n   \n  IT outages are relatively common, tech experts say.   Twenty years ago, it was typical   for IT services to down “all the time,” said Mike Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame and former computer scientist for the National Security Agency.\n \n\n   \n  “It would not be unusual to go a week at work having at least one outage of some IT service,” he said, noting that now everyone relies on the same large providers.\n \n\n   \n  The impacts can be widely felt when they happen at the major providers, such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google, that serve as the backbone of the web.   \n \n\n   \n  Issues submitted to Downdetector, a website that tracks user-reported problems with popular online platforms, surpassed 2.1 million on Tuesday, according to data provided to CNN by Downdetector parent company Ookla.\n \n\n   \n  Cloudflare says it handles 81 million HTTP requests – or when web browsers need certain data to trigger an action, such as loading a webpage – per second on average.\n \n\n   \n    Are there really more outages happening lately?\n \n\n   \n  That there have been three widespread outages in less than a month is a coincidence. But Haggerty acknowledged that it certainly feels like these outages are happening more often, mostly because of the scale of their impact.\n \n\n   \n  The number of service outages has “remained consistent,” but the “number of sites and applications dependent on these services has increased, making them more disruptive to users,” Angelique Medina, head of internet intelligence for Cisco ThousandEyes, told CNN in an emailed statement.\n \n\n   \n  Cisco’s network monitoring service has logged 12 major outages in 2025 so far, according to  a timeline published on its website , not counting Tuesday’s Cloudflare disruption.\n \n\n   \n  That compares to 23 in 2024, 13 in 2023 and 10 in 2022. A  sweeping Crowdstrike outage  upended businesses, flights and hospitals around the world in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  There are some common trends between outages that occurred in the first half of 2025,  according to Cisco . A string of outages were linked to systems accidentally spreading tech failures, systems that appeared to be functioning properly despite silent issues occurring and configuration changes that cascaded.\n \n\n   \n  While these trends aren’t new, Cisco’s blog post says it’s been “seeing more of these types of disruptions with more far-reaching consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’ll likely happen again.\n \n\n   \n  “They aren’t something you’d say, ‘Well, thank God that would never happen to us,’” said Haggerty. “All of these could actually happen to any business.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hadas Gold contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/epstein-survivors-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"09:11:00.000-05:00","title":"‘We have power together’: For Epstein survivors, a day of emotion and triumph","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A group of survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring convened in Washington, D.C., to demand transparency through a press conference and advocacy efforts, culminating in the passage of the Epstein files bill in both the U.S. House and Senate.

Every time someone new arrived, there was an eruption of hugs and cheerful greetings.\n \n\n   \n  The scene could have easily been a joyful reunion of old friends.\n \n\n   \n  But the group was made up of the  survivors of Jeffrey Epstein , forever bonded by their trauma and abuse at the hands of the convicted pedophile. The women had once again descended on Washington, DC, to hold a press conference and plead with lawmakers to  vote to release the Epstein files .\n \n\n   \n  Dani Bensky, who met Epstein when she was a young ballerina, said she had managed to get just a few hours of sleep the previous night. She had spent the evening with the family of the late Epstein victim  Virginia Giuffre , making the most out of the fact that they are rarely in the same place at the same time. It was past midnight when she realized she still hadn’t written out the remarks she would need to make at a press conference just hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “Who writes a speech at one o’clock in the morning the night before? Ai yai yai, rookie mistake on my part,” Bensky said lightheartedly after the press conference, as she quickly made her way to a meeting that was scheduled with a lawmaker. Her fellow survivors, walking alongside her, were quick to reassure her that she had done just fine.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the day, the women stayed close together much like this — there to offer each other pep talks and reminders to drink water and eat; quietly squeezing one another’s hands; and making sure nobody got lost in the maze of hallways on Capitol Hill as they hoped for good news.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Can we give you a hug?’\n \n\n   \n  In the late morning, the women found themselves consoling Republican Rep. Nancy Mace.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina congresswoman walked out into the foyer of her office in the Longworth building in tears. She has been ensnared in a legal battle of her own after  accusing her ex-fiancé  of crimes including physical assault, rape and sex trafficking — allegations he strongly denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ve given me hope that one day I might get justice,” Mace told the Epstein survivors. “It’s very raw for me.”\n \n\n   \n  “Can we give you a hug?” one woman jumped in to ask.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, I would love a hug,” Mace responded, which prompted several women to take turns embracing the lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  Mace was one of only four House Republicans to support a discharge petition to force a House vote on the Epstein files. When an Epstein survivor told the congresswoman that the group had been holding their breath and hoping Mace wouldn’t cave to political pressure and abandon her support for the bill, Mace responded: “Yeah, I ran out of fucks to give a long time ago.”\n \n\n   \n  “We rarely get this chance. This moment is historic,” she said. “Women never get this chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell abused her, told CNN it was impossible for her now to imagine going through this experience alone.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time a large group gathers, it completely changes the dynamic and the experience,” Farmer said. “It really does move us from feeling fearful to feeling like we are feared. We have power together.”\n \n\n   \n  Her sister, Maria, is one of the earliest known Epstein accusers. As Farmer made her way from meeting to meeting on Tuesday, more than once, she was on the phone, keeping her sister apprised of developments.\n \n\n   \n  At 2:43 p.m., the gavel came down in the House — the  Epstein bill had passed  on an overwhelming 427-1 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as she stepped out of the House gallery after passage, Farmer was back on her phone, calling Maria to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just incredible to hear her voice and to be able to tell her it passed and it happened and you were such a big part of it,” Annie said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It kills me that she’s not here’\n \n\n   \n  One Epstein victim was not present on Capitol Hill on Tuesday but her presence could be felt everywhere that the group of survivors went.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, died by suicide in August. In her  posthumously published memoir  released last month, she wrote about having been lent out to an endless stream of wealthy and powerful people. “I believed that I might die a sex slave,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, spoke at the survivors’ press conference and credited his sister for having helped to advance the fight for accountability and transparency, tears streamed down the faces of Giuffre’s fellow victims standing behind Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Sissy,” Roberts said. “You didn’t just make a small dent. You made a monumental impact, a resounding statement that echoed across the world. You built an unbreakable wall, a barrier that will protect future generations from the horrors of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  Bensky, who credits Giuffre for having shaped her own decision to go public with her Epstein story, said she has wondered what Giuffre would have made of this moment.\n \n\n   \n  “It kills me that she’s not here to see it,” Bensky said. “It’s so wrong that she’s just not here. It’s kind of devastating to think that we’re doing this without her.”\n \n\n   \n  Many of the other survivors wore brightly colored butterfly pins on their lapels on Tuesday in Giuffre’s memory. For Bensky and Farmer, their green and pink jeweled brooches were all the more meaningful because they were gifts given to them by Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia chose the symbol of the butterfly because of the metamorphosis and this real belief she had that there could be post-traumatic growth — that you could go through something like this and come out the other side and have so much to give and share,” Farmer told CNN. “And that’s what she did.”\n \n\n   \n  After the passage of the House’s Epstein bill, the women gathered in the early evening to hold a vigil honoring all of Epstein’s victims, including those who have passed. It was right around when Farmer was paying tribute to Giuffre that Bensky got a whisper in her ear: The Senate had decided to pass the Epstein bill immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the survivors had assumed that the bill’s path through the Senate — and to President Donald Trump’s desk — could be long and arduous and had been preparing for another major battle.\n \n\n   \n  “Words will never ever be able to describe this day,” Bensky said. “We just feel like we never have gotten the win, and we got the win. And that feels so good.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/americas/venezuela-maria-corina-machado-freedom-manifesto-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:57:00-05:00","title":"Venezuela’s opposition leader publishes ‘freedom manifesto’ from hiding as Maduro opens door to dialogue with Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Venezuela’s opposition leader María Corina Machado publishes a 'freedom manifesto' from hiding, outlining a democratic vision that emphasizes inalienable rights, decentralization of power, and accountability for Nicolás Maduro’s alleged crimes against humanity.

It’s considered the  largest US military presence  in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  US officials say President Donald Trump is still  weighing  whether to carry out an attack inside Venezuela, though he has hinted that a diplomatic window may be opening.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday he would be open to speaking directly with Maduro at a “certain time,” suggesting he sees a pathway in the country that doesn’t involve dropping bombs or sending commandos to take Maduro out.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro also suggested Monday night that he would be open to dialogue with his American counterpart. “Anyone who wants to talk to Venezuela will talk face to face,” he said on state TV when asked to respond to Trump’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s government has condemned the military build-up, calling it an attempt to oust Maduro from power.\n \n\n   \n  Machado, who has welcomed the US pressure, said in her manifesto that Maduro must be held accountable for his actions, claiming he has committed crimes against humanity including torture, killings and forced disappearances. Venezuela in the past has denied such claims.\n \n\n   \n  Smilde, whose research covers Chavismo, the leftist ideology associated with Maduro’s party, noted that in Machado’s call for justice, she didn’t discuss reconciliation among Venezuelans.\n \n\n   \n  “She doesn’t try to reach out to Chavismo at all here and say, ‘We need this process of reconciliation. We’re all Venezuelans.’ Nothing like that. So it tells me this is a document that is basically oriented toward the international community,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Machado was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize  for keeping “the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/style/sothebys-klimt-cattelan-sales","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:30","title":"Rare Klimt Painting Becomes the Most Expensive Work of Modern Art Ever Sold at Auction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A record-breaking auction at Sotheby’s New York headquarters on November 18, 2025, saw a Gustav Klimt painting, 'Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer,' sell for $236.4 million — the most expensive modern artwork ever sold at auction.

They christened Sotheby’s first sale out of its new US headquarters in New York on Tuesday evening in a buzzy, record-breaking night.\n \n\n   \n  Early on, the headlining artwork by Gustav Klimt, “Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer,” became the most valuable work of modern art to ever sell at auction, reaching   $236.4 million to gasps and applause from the room during the 20-minute bidding war. It was also the most expensive work of art ever sold by Sotheby’s globally.   The portrait of Klimt’s patrons’ young daughter, made in the last years of the artist’s life, was  spared from destruction  during World War II when it was separated from his works that later burned during a fire at Immendorf Castle in Austria.\n \n\n   \n  The lot was “really one of the last opportunities to acquire a (portrait) of this significance by the artist,” noted the auctioneer, Sotheby’s European chairman Oliver Barker, during the sale. In 2023, Klimt’s final completed portrait, “Dame mit Fächer” (Lady with a Fan),” sold for $108.4 million.\n \n\n   \n  The portrait of Lederer, which beat out a  previous record  set by a Andy Warhol work in 2022, was part of the collection of Estée Lauder heir Leonard A. Lauder, who died earlier this year. Across the sale, most   artworks met or exceeded their high estimates, including an Edvard Munch painting at $35.1 million, and a Klimt landscape at $86 million. The tone was set from the first lot, a sculpture by Alexander Calder that attracted nine eager bidders and sold for nearly triple its high estimate at $889,000. So far, Lauder’s collection fetched $527.5 million, well past its estimate of $400 million — with more to be sold during a separate daytime event.\n \n\n   \n  Sales from the Lauder collection kicked off a triumphant night for the top end of the art market, which has been experiencing a slowdown for more than two years.\n \n\n   \n  Following the Lauder sale,   the contemporary sale was led by a monumental $48.3 million Jean-Michel Basquiat work. Significantly, however, two of the top lots — one by Kerry James Marshall and another by Barkley L. Hendricks — failed to sell, in a surprising divergence from the evening’s momentum. In addition, the auction’s most unusual offering, the  220-pound, 18-karat gold toilet  by the conceptual artist and enfant terrible Maurizio Cattelan, only drew a single bid.\n \n\n   \n    One bid for ‘America’\n \n\n   \n  The opulent sculpture, titled “America,” is a sibling to the infamous version, which was exhibited in the Guggenheim as a working toilet and later stolen from Winston Churchill’s birthplace, Blenheim Palace, and never found.\n \n\n   \n  In a first, the starting bid for “America,” which has been in private hands since 2017, was ideated as a moving target according to the current value of its weight in gold, or $9.9 million and rounded up to $10 million. The pricing was a way to “lean into the very essence of the conceptual basis behind the artwork, which is largely to draw attention to the difference between a work’s artistic value, and a work’s inherent material value,” said David Galperin, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art, ahead of the sale. But only one buyer ended up making an offer — a “famous American brand,” per Sotheby’s — and no one followed, implying that bidders decided it wasn’t worth much more than its raw materials. (With fees, it totaled $12.1 million). Considering Cattelan’s satirical sense of humor, it likely amused the artist somewhere in the world.\n \n\n   \n   ﻿ Marquee sales will continue to take place this week, with Sotheby’s hoping to take in more than $1 billion total by the end, based on its high estimates. The pre-sale exhibitions drew crowds to the array of artworks by Basquiat, Yves Klein, Henri Matisse, Cecily Brown and Jeff Koons — as well as lines to Cattelan’s toilet, which was installed on the Breuer Building’s fourth floor in a tiny, mirrored bathroom with a look-but-don’t-touch rule. Sotheby’s new HQ, previously home to the Whitney Museum of American Art and later, an outpost for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s contemporary collection, has signaled a major shift in its public-facing presence, aligning itself just off the city’s famed Museum Mile, where many of its most important institutions reside.\n \n\n   \n  The opening comes at a rocky time for the art market, as global sales of arts and antiques  fell for a second consecutive year  in 2024, according to the latest annual Art Market Report by Art Basel and UBS, and several major brick-and-mortar galleries have shuttered or shifted operations. In May, following the springtime marquee sales in New York, The Art Newspaper  reported  that auction houses Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips saw an 8% slump in sales compared to the year prior, with top lots failing to find buyers or being withdrawn ahead of the sale.\n \n\n   \n  But with the highly successful off-season sale of art collector and patron  Pauline Karpidas’ surrealist works  this summer, as well as reports of mid-market resilience, some analyses have cautiously pointed to a market rebound. Christie’s fared well during its  two-part 20th-century sale  on Monday evening, reaching $690 million with fees — a substantial increase from 2024 — led by a $62 million Mark Rothko painting.\n \n\n   \n  Record-smashing sales of individual artworks exceeding $40 million haven’t been a guarantee this year, but later in the week, Sotheby’s has another rabbit in the hat — a psychologically haunting painting by Frida Kahlo, “El sueño (La cama),” which could break Georgia O’Keeffe’s record for the most expensive artwork publicly sold by a female artist.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with more details of the sale. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/khashoggi-murder-trump-bin-saudi-crown-prince","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:31:00-20:31","title":"Trump claims slain journalist Khashoggi was 'extremely controversial,' defends Saudi crown prince","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a high-profile visit to the White House, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was welcomed with full diplomatic honors, while President Donald Trump dismissed questions about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, calling him 'extremely controversial' and claiming the topic was raised to embarrass the Crown Prince.

PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Tuesday angrily dismissed a question about the 2018 murder of  Jamal Khashoggi , claiming the Saudi dissident journalist was “extremely controversial” and insisting the subject was only raised during his meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to embarrass his visitor.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial. A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you liked him or didn’t like him, things happen,” Trump said in the Oval Office as he presided over a pageant-filled visit for the de facto Saudi leader.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went on to insist Prince bin Salman — who the CIA assessed  likely ordered the murder  — wasn’t involved.\n \n\n   \n  “He knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,” Trump said, turning toward the crown prince.\n \n\n   \n  The moment was the best illustration yet that the period of diplomatic isolation Prince bin Salman endured following Khashoggi’s murder is over. For his first visit to the White House in more than seven years, the crown prince was welcomed with  all the trappings of a state visit , the highest form of American diplomatic reception.\n \n\n   \n  His black Mercedes limousine was escorted onto the South Lawn by a team of dark horses as a military band trumpeted his arrival. A flyover of fighter jets that included F-35s – the jets Trump says he’s planning to sell to Riyadh – blared overhead. Later, Trump is hosting a black-tie dinner in the East Room.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting in the Oval Office, Trump heaped praise on the crown prince, including for what he called his “incredible” record on human rights. The president touted new deals on Saudi investments in the United States, and affirmed his plans to sell the American-made jets, even as the crown prince stopped short of committing to some of Trump’s priorities.\n \n\n   \n  And instead of merely glossing over the 2018 murder, which took place at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Trump took offense that the subject was raised at all during what he intended to be a splashy show of respect.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump told the reporter, longtime ABC White House correspondent Mary Bruce, who questioned him about the murder.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting beside Trump, the crown prince appeared nonplussed by the discussion of his alleged role in the murder, which was committed by Saudi agents who later dismembered the US resident and Washington Post columnist.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s painful and it’s a huge mistake,” Prince bin Salman said, going on to defend a Saudi investigation afterward.\n \n\n   \n  “About the journalist, it’s really painful to hear anyone that been losing his life for no real purpose or not in a legal way, and it’s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia “did all the right steps of investigation” and that “we are doing our best that this doesn’t happen again.”\n \n\n   \n  Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, Jamal Khashoggi’s widow, responded to Trump’s claim that her slain husband was “extremely controversial,” saying that was no reason for him to have been assassinated.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not justification to murder him. Jamal was a good transparent and brave man,” she said in a statement to CNN, adding that “many may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press. The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.”\n \n\n   \n  In  an editorial , The Post wrote that Trump’s comments “dishonor Khashoggi’s legacy, stand at odds with the facts and are beneath the office of the president.”\n \n\n   \n  The CIA assessment released in 2021 found the prince approved the assassination of the Washington Post columnist, though he has long denied any involvement.\n \n\n   \n  “We base this assessment on the Crown Prince’s control of decision-making in the Kingdom, the direct involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin Salman’s protective detail in the operation, and the Crown Prince’s support for using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad, including Khashoggi,” the report said.\n \n\n   \n  During his first term, Trump largely shrugged off Prince bin Salman’s potential role in Khashoggi’s murder, though he described himself as “extremely angry and very unhappy” about the killing.\n \n\n   \n  His successor, President Joe Biden, pledged as a candidate to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah.” But even Biden came to recognize the kingdom and its crown prince were too powerful and influential to ignore entirely. He flew to the country in 2022 in a mostly unsuccessful attempt to convince Saudi Arabia to increase its oil output.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has actively sought to cultivate his relationship with the kingdom in his second term, visiting Riyadh in May to discuss new investments and security arrangements. His interest in the kingdom has drawn scrutiny for his family’s financial interests in the country, though he dismissed those concerns Tuesday. “I have nothing to do with the family business. I have left,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s hope is that Saudi Arabia eventually joins the Abraham Accords, his signature diplomatic achievement, by normalizing its relations with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  But Prince bin Salman made clear that wasn’t happening Tuesday, or anytime before a clear pathway exists for an independent Palestinian state.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to be part of the Abraham Accords,” the crown prince said. “But we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path to a two-state solution.”\n \n\n   \n  So, too, was Prince bin Salman noncommittal when it came to providing funding to help rebuild Gaza. He said he was in “discussion” on the matter before Trump interjected to insist “it will be a lot.”\n \n\n   \n  The crown prince did say he would increase Saudi Arabia’s investment pledge in the United States from the $600 billion announced in May to $1 trillion – a massive figure that’s nearly the kingdom’s entire yearly economic output.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, seemed eager to provide new American assistance to Saudi Arabia, including a defense pact and an agreement that would help the kingdom develop a civilian nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Mostly, however, he seemed intent on honoring the crown prince, who has consolidated power and is now the kingdom’s day-to-day ruler.\n \n\n   \n  “I just want to thank you,” Trump said. “We’ve been really good friends for a long period of time. We’ve always been on the same side of every issue.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/roman-surovtsev-ukraine-deportation-hope","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-20:45","title":"A Dallas Dad Came to Terms with His Imminent Deportation.

His case became a focal point of public attention due to his history of a 19-year-old armed carjacking conviction, which was later vacated due to ineffective legal representation.

Then an 11th-hour court order gave hope to see his family again \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:26 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Saturday evening, Samantha Surovtsev squinted at her phone, blinking through tears as she rushed to order a set of Eastern European power adapters. Despite the 80-degree North Texas heat, she then drove to Old Navy and bought two bulky winter coats.\n \n\n   \n  When the adapters arrived Sunday, she tucked them into a suitcase alongside the coats and wool socks and drove everything to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Alvarado.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband,  Roman Surovtsev , was inside. The 41-year-old had been there for 109 days, after being unexpectedly detained during a routine check-in with ICE in August. Surovtsev had been convicted of armed carjacking when he was 19 and was released from prison in 2014 before a six-month stint in ICE custody. The run-in cost him his permanent resident status.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was swept up again in ICE detainment as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration, an effort stretching across the country from  Charlotte  to  Portland , fracturing families and communities.\n \n\n   \n  Since returning to office, Trump has implemented policies to deport undocumented migrants en masse. ICE agents have been  directed  to detain and arrest people at  work ,  courthouses,   churches and schools  as part of the administration’s  deportation push .\n \n\n   \n  Now the husband and father of two was a day away from boarding a deportation flight with dozens of other detainees to war-torn Ukraine, a country he hadn’t lived in since it was part of the Soviet Union.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Surovtsev’s case. In a Monday post on X, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Surovtsev a “criminal illegal alien” with “a history of violence,” citing carjacking and burglary charges alongside a number of other offenses of which he hasn’t been convicted.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday night, he used the center’s tablet to call his wife, family and in-laws to say what he believed were his final goodbyes. Immigration officials wouldn’t tell Surovtsev, his attorneys or Samantha when or where specifically he was being removed, citing security concerns, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  All they could do now was wait.\n \n\n   \n  Monday passed in agonizing quiet. Samantha sat by the phone for hours, waiting for confirmation that the worst had happened, that Surovtsev had been officially deported.\n \n\n   \n  His immigration attorney finally called at 3:29 p.m. She stepped outside, away from the sounds of her young daughters playing inside.\n \n\n   \n  “The stay has been granted,” the attorney told her. The flight full of detainees would still leave for Ukraine, but he wouldn’t be on it.\n \n\n   \n    ‘God’s timing is perfect’\n \n\n   \n  Roman Surovtsev was born in the former Soviet Union in 1984 and fled to the US legally with his mother and two siblings when he was 4 years old. Although they found relief from Soviet rule in their new country, he grew up in poverty and instability.\n \n\n   \n  In 2003, at 19 years old, Surovtsev began serving a 13-year sentence after helping some friends commit an armed carjacking of a motorcycle in California. In prison, he was baptized, a turning point that transformed him, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  He met Samantha in 2017 while jet skiing with mutual friends in Orange County, and the two eventually married, bought a home outside Dallas, launched a painting business and started a family. Surovtsev has never violated the terms of his supervision order, his lawyers wrote in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  When Samantha hung up with the attorney on Monday, her heart racing, she rang the tablet at the detention center.\n \n\n   \n  “Are you listening?” she asked Surovtsev when he picked up. “They issued the stay, and they’re reopening your case.”\n \n\n   \n  His lawyers thought it would take two to three months to hear from a judge about the motion to reopen his case, which they filed November 4.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev wept. “God’s timing is perfect,” he told her.\n \n\n   \n  “We had accepted that Roman would be on that plane, and I was thinking about what our lives are going to look like and if we could ever get to him again,” Samantha said. “And suddenly, it’s all reversed, because there’s still hope.”\n \n\n   \n  She spent the rest of the day telling family and friends the news.\n \n\n   \n  That night, as Samantha tucked their daughters into bed, her 5-year-old asked if they could call dad. For months, Samantha had told the girls that their father was simply “at work.”\n \n\n   \n  When he picked up the tablet, the two talked excitedly about all the things they planned to do when Surovtsev came home. He promised her he would build a massive Barbie dollhouse to go into the attic playroom he made for his girls.\n \n\n   \n  His daughter squealed with excitement.\n \n\n   \n    Decades of legal battles, time served and reform led to the stay\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was released early on good behavior in 2014 when an immigration court judge ordered him to be deported. He lost his green card, and he was placed into ICE custody, but the agency ran into trouble removing him from the country.\n \n\n   \n  Having been born in the former Soviet Union, the Russian Consulate told the US government in early 2015 it had no records of Surovtsev, his lawyers wrote in court filings. The Ukrainian government also said at the time it couldn’t confirm his citizenship given that Surovtsev was from a region of Ukraine that’s at war and not readily reachable, and therefore could not issue him Ukrainian travel documents.\n \n\n   \n  Subsequently, Surovtsev was released from ICE custody in May 2015 on an order of supervision without his green card but with an employment authorization document, a work permit, and was required to wear an ankle monitor for six months. He checked in with ICE every other week before his visits became quarterly, then annual.\n \n\n   \n  For years, he checked in at the kiosk of the Dallas ICE office, confirming details like his address and any travel plans in between starting his own business and building a family.\n \n\n   \n  His unexpected detainment during a routine check-in on August 1 mobilized Samantha, who rallied a team of lawyers to represent him.\n \n\n   \n  His counsel was able to successfully vacate Surovtsev’s carjacking charge, essentially wiping it from his record, on the grounds that he received ineffective counsel back in 2014, Surovtsev’s immigration lawyer Jennifer Rozdzielski said. This empowered his attorneys to file a motion earlier this month to reopen his old criminal case in hopes of getting it dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  In the 11th hour on Monday, just before he was to board the deportation flight bound for Ukraine, a court in California agreed to hear his case and ordered a stay of his removal, barring the US government from deporting him.\n \n\n   \n  “Respondent has demonstrated new, material evidence to warrant reopening of these proceedings,” the order, reviewed by CNN, reads. “His convictions were vacated pursuant to California Penal Code 1473.7(a)(1), specifically due to constitutional defects in the underlying criminal proceedings, so Respondent met his ‘heavy burden’ to show that his evidence ‘would likely change the result’ in his case.”\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev will remain in detention while the court proceedings play out.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re just thankful that plane took off without him, and that the judge ruled the way she did, because all we wanted was time for our case to be heard. And we got it,” Samantha said.\n \n\n   \n  But Surovtsev’s team has acknowledged that the fight isn’t over.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s next is making sure that not a single other Ukrainian who’s in detention is sent back to that country,” said Eric Lee, one of Surovtsev’s attorneys.\n \n\n   \n    The flight carrying dozens of detainees still took off for Ukraine, attorneys said\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev’s relief while his court proceedings play out comes at a bittersweet moment for his legal team and other families. Some deportees boarded Monday’s flight and are now in Ukraine, his attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n  “However many people were ultimately successfully deported to Ukraine are probably fighting for their lives right now,” said Lee. “We’re glad at least one person was prevented from going on that flight, but we’re very upset about all the others and very, very sorry for their families.”\n \n\n   \n  Samantha has been in contact with several other families with loved ones who were deported on Monday’s flight. None of them have been able to get ahold of them yet, she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on the flight to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  One family is tracking their deportee’s phone, with an app showing it on the move inside Ukraine, Samantha said. But he’s not answering their calls, and they’re not sure if he still has his phone.\n \n\n   \n  Another detainee has a background similar to Surovtsev – a USSR child refugee who got into trouble as a teenager, served his sentence and moved through adulthood with a supervision order from ICE, his attorney Ann Peters said. Her client, who also narrowly missed being deported Monday, is the primary caretaker of his brother, a paralyzed Marine Corps veteran.\n \n\n   \n  As Samantha and other detainees’ families sit in legal limbo during what feels like an endless pursuit to see their loved ones again, Samantha said the Bible verse Romans 8:31 is keeping her warm.\n \n\n   \n  “If God is for us, who can be against us?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/americas/brazil-supreme-court-sentences-military-officials-lula-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:43:00-05:00","title":"Brazil’s Supreme Court sentences military officials for planning to kill Lula","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brazil’s Supreme Court has sentenced nine high-ranking military officials and one federal police officer to prison terms ranging from 1 year and 11 months to 24 years for plotting to kill President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, as part of an attempt to stage a coup and abolish democratic rule.

\n   \n  A panel of Brazilian Supreme Court justices sentenced high-ranking military officials and a federal police officer to up to 24 years in prison on Tuesday after finding them guilty of attempting a coup and plotting to kill President  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  and other authorities.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the Supreme Court panel sentenced former President  Jair Bolsonaro  to 27 years and three months in prison for leading the criminal organization that sought to overturn the 2022 election, when Lula defeated Bolsonaro. At the time, the panel also sentenced other close allies who justices said formed part of the “core group.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the panel convicted those accused of planning the criminal organization’s violent actions, which included a plot to kill Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice  Alexandre de Moraes .\n \n\n   \n  Of the 10 defendants forming part of this group, nine are high-ranking military officers and one a member of the federal police.\n \n\n   \n  The four-justice panel unanimously convicted nine of them, acquitting a retired general due to insufficient evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Seven of them were convicted of attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, attempted coup, participation in an armed criminal organization, aggravated damage and deterioration of listed heritage.\n \n\n   \n  Two were convicted of the less serious offences of criminal association and public incitement of animosity between the Armed Forces and constitutional authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Sentences ranged from 1 year and 11 months to 24 years, with four defendants handed down time behind bars of more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  “Brazil, once again, due to the irresponsibility and lack of patriotism of some, flirted with and almost fell into a chasm of institutional darkness,” Justice Flávio Dino said as he cast his vote, in a reference to Brazil’s military dictatorship (1964-1985).\n \n\n   \n  “It wasn’t just a walk in the park. It was a coup that was going to arrest and kill people, revoke the constitution, citizenship and the free press. And these are not conjectures: it was written in the planning seized from these various public agents,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet pointed to evidence that a federal police officer infiltrated the security team of the then president-elect to enable the group’s violent plans.\n \n\n   \n  The plan didn’t advance due to the Army commander’s lack of support, according to Moraes, who is overseeing the sprawling coup case.\n \n\n   \n  Those convicted will only start serving time once appeals are exhausted.\n \n\n   \n  That’s also the case for Bolsonaro, who has been under house arrest since August.\n \n\n   \n  The panel recently rejected an appeal filed by the former president’s legal team, but another one could be submitted this week.\n \n\n   \n  Bolsonaro’s trial made global headlines. US President Donald Trump ordered a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods and cited in part Bolsonaro’s case, which he called a “witch hunt.”\n \n\n   \n  That triggered a sharp deterioration in US-Brazil relations, which experts described as the lowest point in their more than 200-year history.\n \n\n   \n  Relations have improved.

Archaeologists may have uncovered a Bronze Age metropolis in Kazakhstan’s steppe \n       \n  By Taylor Nicioli, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:50 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Upon the open grasslands of what is now Kazakhstan, there once stood a  Bronze Age  settlement that may have served as a center of exchange and power around 1600 BC.\n \n\n   \n  The settlement — called Semiyarka and nicknamed “The City of Seven Ravines” for its location overlooking a network of valleys — was first discovered in the early 2000s, but it wasn’t until an international group of archaeologists surveyed the area starting in 2018 that its impressive size and potential importance within the Eurasian Steppe came to light. What the team discovered was an expansive area that was once replete with houses, a central monumental building, which may have been used for rituals or governance, and possibly even tin bronze metal production facilities.\n \n\n   \n  Their findings, published  Monday in the journal Antiquity , are just the beginning, the study authors said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very exciting, because it’s such a rare find to have tin bronze production in this area,” said lead author Miljana Radivojević, an associate professor in archaeological science at University College London, UK. “We know we have hundreds of thousands of tin bronze artifacts from the Bronze Age in the  Eurasian steppe  and we have only one published site on tin bronze production. And this is the second one.” Tin bronze allowed for sturdier tools and other materials to be made, Radivojević added.\n \n\n   \n  As the team now embarks on excavating the area, they say the continued discoveries of Semiyarka are transforming what we know about urban life in prehistoric Eurasia.\n \n\n   \n  “We just don’t have anything like this at all,” said study coauthor Dan Lawrence, a professor of archaeology at Durham University in the UK. There are hardly settlements of any kind recovered in the steppe, he added. “What you get across this landscape, we associate with mobile pastoral groups, and we think maybe they were in tents or yurts. What we’ve got here is something that’s very clearly quite different.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanning 140  hectares  (about 346 acres) above the Irtysh River valley, the large size and strategic location of the settlement may indicate that the Bronze Age steppe had sophisticated cities similar to those located in more urban areas of the world at the time, Lawrence added.\n \n\n   \n    Surveying a long-lost city\n \n\n   \n  To find the borders of the settlement, Lawrence led the team in a survey project that looked at satellite imagery and analyzed every 50-meter square across the site. They only examined the surface, finding pottery fragments, including at least 114 ceramic vessels, and other artifacts scattered across the settlement.\n \n\n   \n  The team also used imagery from  Corona spy photography  dating to the 1960s, to identify where the land had been disturbed during the last several decades, as well as magnetometry, a noninvasive survey technique that allowed the archaeologists to see buried structures and metal objects without having to excavate.\n \n\n   \n  The next step, excavations, are underway now, and Radivojević says more discoveries have already been made. “What has been published is that we had indications — we looked at the materials that were crucibles and slags and artifacts, and we could just connect them and say, well, these are the bronzes,” she said. “But then as we go, we have more discoveries, so I was more confident in talking about, say, a larger-scale production of metallurgy on the site.”\n \n\n   \n  But not everyone agrees on whether Semiyarka resembled a major city. “The results, at least those presented in the article, would suggest a strong ‘NO’ to that question, especially given the low-density pottery sherd scatter on the surface and seemingly equally low-density evidence for metallurgy,” James Johnson, an archaeologist and assistant instructional professor in anthropology at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, said in an email. Johnson, who has studied Bronze and Iron Age pastoralist societies of the Eurasian steppe, was not involved with the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “Cities are spatial and demographic entities that usually represent the complex interplay of the built environment, population density and sprawl, and material culture (as well as numerous other sociological factors),” he added. The low number of ceramic artifacts found could indicate a limited use of pottery, common among prehistoric steppe societies, and that pottery might not be “the best material culture category to connect with population density usually associated with urban populations.”\n \n\n   \n  Further research into the middens, heaps of remains that provide a glimpse into past human life, as well as surface collections beyond the settlement would help archaeologists better understand settlement patterns, Johnson said.\n \n\n   \n  While Lawrence agrees that there isn’t enough evidence to conclude that the settlement was a major city, “I also think we can’t say it is a strong no for the same reasons,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The relatively small amount of pottery remains can be attributed to the fact that the ground is undisturbed and compacted by several feet of snow every winter; many artifacts could still be underground, Lawrence noted.\n \n\n   \n  He continued: “Different things happen in urban settlements than in the rural ones. For example, in modern times you need to go to a city to get heavy industry, fancy shops or a seat of political power. I think we can say that Semiyarka is a city in the sense that it is very different from surrounding settlements and provides just those kinds of urban services.”\n \n\n   \n  Semiyarka could be evidence that the region found a balance between the typical pastoralist mobile sites and other important societal elements, such as tin bronze production, one of the most important technologies of the time, said Michael Frachetti, a professor of archaeology at Washington University in St. Louis.\n \n\n   \n  “Although the archaeological scale and function of these central places is still unfolding, the results so far open many questions about the organizational choices steppe societies made in terms of metallurgy, political organization, and economic connectivity at both local and regional scales,” Frachetti said in an email. Frachetti, who specializes in pastoralism in the Bronze Age, was also not involved with the study.\n \n\n   \n    In search of answers\n \n\n   \n  There is not a lot of evidence of settlements in the Eurasia steppe during the Bronze Age; most sites were mobile, and did not leave behind a lot of archaeological evidence, Lawrence said. However, the grasslands haven’t received much archaeological attention, he added, and it’s possible there are many settlements still left to be uncovered\n \n\n   \n  With future research, the study authors said they hope to find further evidence of Semiyarka’s potentially powerful role during the Bronze Age, as well as insight into urban life and metal production within the steppe.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, their research has revealed the outlines of at least 15 structures throughout the settlement, with a few showing evidence of being houses with internal rooms.\n \n\n   \n  How many people lived there? How long did the settlement survive? What connections did the city have to other areas? Lawrence hopes that the excavation process will turn up answers.\n \n\n   \n  “This site is super interesting because it just breaks from all the things that we thought we knew about Central Asia up to this point,” Lawrence said. “And so understanding how that got there, why that got there, and then how it connects to these much larger stories is really interesting, and it’s not something we can answer yet, but now we know the site’s there, we can start to develop a program to try and understand what it all means.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/epstein-files-vote-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:48:00-05:00","title":"Congress greenlights bill forcing Trump’s DOJ to release Epstein files after monthslong GOP effort to quash it","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant political reversal, Congress passed a bipartisan bill requiring President Donald Trump’s Justice Department to release all investigative files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, after months of GOP resistance and internal party infighting.

\nUpdated: \n        6:48 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday took the significant step of ordering  President Donald Trump ’s Justice Department to publicly release all of its investigative files into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after months of nasty infighting within the GOP.\n \n\n   \n  Congress is sending the measure — which remarkably won support from all but one Republican across both the House and Senate — to Trump’s desk once it’s formally transmitted between the chambers. Despite months of calling the issue a “Democratic hoax,” the president has said he’ll sign the bill.\n \n\n   \n  Trump will do so “whenever it gets to the White House,” a senior White House official said Tuesday evening. (The president was already scheduled to host the Saudi crown prince for dinner at the White House Tuesday night.)\n \n\n   \n  The speed with which the bill moved through both chambers of Congress on Tuesday marked a stark reversal from recent months when Trump and GOP leaders worked furiously to quash it. But Trump ultimately decided to allow his party to back the measure as pressure mounted within his party.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, even Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team backed the measure, despite spending the summer and fall trying to quash Washington’s obsession with the Epstein files, while insisting the bill did not do enough to protect victims’ privacy. And in the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune did not stand in the way of Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s request for “unanimous consent” to pass it, sending it directly to Trump once received from the House.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson said earlier Tuesday he was urging his Senate counterpart to add key protections for victims’ privacy, which would have slowed the bill, but Thune said he was unlikely to amend the legislation that came out of the House nearly unanimously. “I think, when a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1, and the President has said he’s going to sign it, I’m not sure that amending it … is in the cards,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Johnson said, “all the Republicans want to go on record to show they’re for maximum transparency.”\n \n\n   \n  It was a remarkable turnaround for Trump and Republican leaders in Washington, who had unsuccessfully tried to halt the measure led by a party agitator, Rep. Thomas Massie, and strongly backed by Democrats. But by this weekend, with a House vote looming, Trump and his team  feared an embarrassing defeat  was coming and he agreed to relent — effectively allowing GOP lawmakers to vote for Massie’s measure.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an overdue moment,” Massie said Tuesday, hours ahead of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win,” the Kentucky Republican said during a news conference on Capitol Hill, quickly adding that they are now “on our side today.”\n \n\n   \n  Massie has been pilloried by Trump and his advisers in recent weeks, including personal attacks on his marriage and a campaign to primary him in his district.\n \n\n   \n  Yet on Tuesday, Massie said he welcomed Trump’s turnaround on the issue: “What he’s doing this week is strengthening his position by coming on board, and we’re glad to have him.”\n \n\n   \n  While Johnson delivered a blistering critique of Democrats over the Epstein saga ahead of the vote, the effort drew widespread support from Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s get accountability, let’s get answers and let’s get this over with,” GOP Rep. Kevin Kiley of California said.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, added of the vote: “We all support holding bad guys accountable, and we’re all going to vote for this resolution.”\n \n\n   \n  The only lawmaker to vote against it, Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, said he did so because of the way the legislation is written. “It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America. As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,” he wrote on X after casting his vote.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Johnson and GOP leaders are hopeful that they can soon turn the page from the months-long Epstein saga within their own conference, which has led to bitter feuds — like the one between Trump and his once-close ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Greene in recent months has joined Massie in pushing for the release of the files, prompting Trump himself to call her a “traitor” and call for her to be ousted in a primary race.\n \n\n   \n  The House’s investigative committees have launched their own inquiries into the Epstein matter.\n \n\n   \n  It was Trump himself who had initially helped gin up the GOP’s interest in the government’s Epstein investigation. The president had repeatedly speculated publicly whether the late financier and sex offender had died in prison and promised on the campaign trail to declassify the files.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s hand-picked DOJ officials had, too, fueled the speculation. When asked by a conservative podcast host in 2023 why the so-called Epstein list had not been released, Kash Patel suggested it was being kept hidden “because of who’s on that list.” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in February of this year that the Epstein client list was sitting on her desk.\n \n\n   \n  But months into Trump’s second term, the White House had released no new information about that investigation. The Epstein issue was quickly creating a major rift between Trump and his MAGA base. Many of his supporters were loudly complaining that the administration was failing to release what Trump once promised he would: the complete set of government files on Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after, Massie, along with his Democratic partner, Rep. Ro Khanna, launched a rogue push to go around the speaker and bring a bill to the floor without GOP leaders’ approval. A handful of other Republicans — all women, including Greene — signed on, too.\n \n\n   \n  The White House resisted the effort, with personal phone calls to members who had backed the measure and public threats to Massie, Greene and others.\n \n\n   \n  But they couldn’t block it entirely. Just days earlier, Massie and Khanna secured the 218th signature on a procedural gambit, known as a discharge petition, that forced Johnson to bring the bill to the floor.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, who provided that final signature to advance the measure, insisted on Tuesday it was not just a Democrat or Republican push.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a demand from the nation. This is not a partisan issue,” Grijalva said.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/americas/torres-del-paine-snowstorm-five-dead-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:10:00-05:00","title":"Five tourists killed by snowstorm in Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At least five tourists, including two Mexicans, two Germans, and one Briton, were killed in a deadly snowstorm at Torres del Paine National Park in southern Chile.

However, Trump responded by downplaying the incident, asserting the crown prince had 'no knowledge' of it and implying Khashoggi was 'extremely controversial' and 'had it coming.' He also rebuked a reporter for asking questions about the murder, and his actions mirror a broader pattern across his public tenure, in which he praised leaders like Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, Saddam Hussein, Rodrigo Duterte, and Aleksandr Lukashenko—despite their well-documented human rights violations.

\nUpdated: \n        7:53 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In 2018, the  CIA under the first Trump administration concluded  that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the gruesome murder of a US resident and journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP-led Senate  voted unanimously to condemn  the crown prince. One Republican senator remarked at the time that if the matter went before a jury, the crown prince “would be convicted in 30 minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear that he simply doesn’t care about Khashoggi’s killing all that much. But even by his standards, Trump’s  comments alongside the crown prince  on Tuesday were stunning.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went from downplaying Khashoggi’s murder to vouching for the crown prince (who has denied personal involvement).\n \n\n   \n  While Trump  previously suggested  we’d never know for sure whether the crown prince were guilty, this time he said affirmatively that Prince bin Salman “knew nothing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  While the president previously gestured suggestively at conservative talking points about Khashoggi’s past associations with Islamist movements (a past that the evidence shows  Khashoggi abandoned ), this time Trump all but said the journalist had it coming. He called Khashoggi “extremely controversial,” and said, “Whether you liked him or didn’t like him, things happen” — as if dismembering someone with a bone saw were just a fluke.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most strikingly, Trump rebuked a reporter for even asking about this in the crown prince’s presence.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Khashoggi’s widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, responded to Trump’s comments by saying the journalist’s past was “not justification to murder him.”\n \n\n   \n  “Jamal was a good, transparent and brave man,” she added in comments to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is hardly the first president to bow to the strategic and geopolitical importance of keeping good relations with Saudi Arabia;  presidents of both parties  have offered tough talk about the Saudis on the campaign trail and then adjusted course once in office.\n \n\n   \n  But what sets Trump apart is his almost complete lack of interest in even  pretending  that he’s factoring human rights into that equation. In fact, he opened his meeting with the crown prince on Tuesday by saying, “What he’s done is incredible, in terms of human rights and everything else.”\n \n\n   \n  And this has been a constant throughout Trump’s decade in the national spotlight.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some of his more remarkable comments on human rights and alleged human rights abusers, mostly from his first term.\n \n\n   \n    2017: Likening US conduct to Vladimir Putin’s political assassinations\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Trump first took office, then-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly posited to him that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “a killer.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of killers,” Trump  said . “You think our country’s so innocent?”\n \n\n   \n  When Russia’s war in Ukraine began in 2022, Trump initially  praised Putin’s “genius” and “savvy”  in launching the unprovoked invasion, even as Western leaders roundly condemned it. (Trump has since said he’s “very disappointed” in the Russian leader amid the ongoing war.)\n \n\n   \n    2018: Making similar comments about North Korea’s Kim Jong Un\n \n\n   \n  When another Fox host noted that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un executed lots of people, Trump responded: “He’s a tough guy.”\n \n\n   \n  When pressed again on Kim  doing “some really bad things,”  Trump  added : “Yeah, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I mean, I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done. Now look, with all of that being said, the answer is yes.”\n \n\n   \n    2016: Praising Saddam Hussein for killing alleged terrorists without due process\n \n\n   \n  “He was a bad guy — really bad guy,” Trump, then a presidential candidate,  said  of late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. “But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn’t read them the rights. They didn’t talk. They were terrorists — over.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Hussein killed lots of people — not just alleged terrorists — without due process. A  2002 State Department report  said he did so “because he believes that their political beliefs, faith, ethnic background, family members or acquaintances are a threat to his power.”\n \n\n   \n    2017: Praising Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for his drug war\n \n\n   \n  Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war featured large numbers of extrajudicial killings and was widely condemned by human rights groups.\n \n\n   \n  And not only did Trump not condemn that; he at one point during his first term praised Duterte.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” Trump told Duterte during an April 29, 2017, phone call,  according to a transcript  whose basic contents were confirmed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump added: “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing, and I just wanted to call and tell you that.”\n \n\n   \n  (A senior US official said at the time that Trump was merely acknowledging the US is combating its own drug problem, not condoning violence and human rights violations.)\n \n\n   \n    2019: Allegedly encouraging China’s Uyghur detention camps\n \n\n   \n  Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton in his 2020 book recounted a scene from a G20 summit. In it, Trump and Chinese leader  Xi Jinping discussed the Chinese government’s detention camps for Uyghur Muslims in western China.\n \n\n   \n  “With only interpreters present, Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do,” Bolton  wrote . “The National Security Council’s top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China.”\n \n\n   \n  Then-US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  denied the account , calling it “absolutely untrue” and “completely crazy.”\n \n\n   \n    2025: Praising Belarus’ president\n \n\n   \n  Trump  in a social media post  in August referred to the “highly respected President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko.”\n \n\n   \n  Lukashenko has long been accused of  egregious human rights abuses  and even  crimes against humanity . He has often been called  Europe’s last dictator  by foreign policy watchers.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, Trump’s own State Department in 2020  declined to recognize Lukashenko  as the legitimate president of Belarus, citing a rigged election.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/middleeast/israeli-strikes-palestinian-refugee-camp-lebanon-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:59:00Z","title":"Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon kills 13 people, Lebanon’s health ministry says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Israeli airstrike on the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon killed 13 people and injured several others.

He expresses his admiration for authoritarians almost as often.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday showed how intertwined those two instincts really are.\n \n\n   \n  Trump repeatedly objected to press questions during an Oval Office photo op with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, whose country does not have a free press.\n \n\n   \n  He lashed out at an ABC correspondent, Mary Bruce, after she invoked the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.\n \n\n   \n  The president said his ally, Brendan Carr, the chairman of the FCC, should “look at” punishing ABC over its news coverage.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the license should be taken away from ABC because your news is so fake and it’s so wrong,” he asserted.\n \n\n   \n  Trump misstated how FCC licenses actually work, but his message was clear: He’d like his government to retaliate the way a dictator would.\n \n\n   \n  The president also called Bruce “insubordinate,” a word he rarely ever uses, while sitting next to the son of the Saudi king.\n \n\n   \n  According to  Reporters Without Borders , which tracks press freedom all around the world, “independent media are non-existent in Saudi Arabia, and Saudi journalists live under heavy surveillance, even when abroad.”\n \n\n   \n  “Despite societal reforms, journalists are still being detained and media outlets operate under strict state control,” the organization says.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has no such control over the American media, but he acts like he wants to have it.\n \n\n   \n  In his comments on Tuesday, Trump was “reflecting his belief that the press is there to be subservient to him, to shut up when he demands they shut up when he finds the question embarrassing,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now, a non-profit founded by Khashoggi in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s the multi-part question from Bruce that triggered the tense exchange:\n \n\n   \n  “Is it appropriate, Mr. President, for your family to be doing business in Saudi Arabia while you’re president? Is that a conflict of interest? And, your royal highness, the US intelligence (community) concluded you orchestrated the brutal murder of a journalist. 9/11 families are furious that you are here in the Oval Office. Why should Americans trust you? And the same to you, Mr. President.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Bruce could complete the question, Trump repeatedly asked, “Who are you with?”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m with ABC News, sir,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “Fake news,” Trump claimed, deriding one of the best-known news brands in America as “one of the worst in the business.”\n \n\n   \n  “But the question is important, sir,” Bruce said, unfazed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went on to claim that he has “nothing to do with the family business,” then spoke dismissively about Khashoggi, calling the dissident journalist “ extremely controversial .”\n \n\n   \n  Prince bin Salman said Khashoggi’s murder has “been painful for us in Saudi Arabia” and defended the Saudi investigation into the crime.\n \n\n   \n  Karen Attiah, who edited Khashoggi’s columns for The Washington Post, wrote on Bluesky that Trump’s comments about the slain journalist were “absolutely vile.”\n \n\n   \n  Minutes later, when Bruce asked an unrelated question about “the Epstein files,” Trump berated her for having an unpleasant “attitude.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the way you ask these questions,” he said. Circling back to the Khashoggi question for the prince, he said, “You start off with a man who is highly respected, asking him a horrible, insubordinate, and just a terrible question. And you could even ask that same question nicely.”\n \n\n   \n  Then he tore into ABC, calling it a “crappy company,” and raising the specter of government retaliation.\n \n\n   \n  The FCC regulates the licenses of local TV and radio stations nationwide, including those owned by ABC. But the national network is not licensed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly spoken of wanting to revoke licenses, which would break with decades of precedent and likely spark lengthy legal battles.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on X, “Trump again directs the FCC to rescind a broadcast license over a reporter’s question. Thin-skinned. Weak. Un-American. Authoritarian.”\n \n\n   \n  ABC had no comment about his latest threat. But some of Bruce’s colleagues at ABC and fellow members of the White House press corps cheered her persistence in posts on social media.\n \n\n   \n  The National Press Club warned in a statement that Trump’s minimizing of Khashoggi’s murder can have “real-world consequences” because such statements “can embolden those who wish to silence reporters, and they can undermine the essential principle that journalists must be able to work without fear of violence or retribution.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/three-mile-island-restart-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:11:00Z","title":"Trump administration lends $1 billion to restart Three Mile Island nuclear reactor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has approved a $1 billion loan to Constellation Energy Corp to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania, a project that began in late 2024 with a partnership between Constellation and Microsoft to supply clean, uninterrupted power for data centers.

administration said on Tuesday it has loaned Constellation Energy Corp $1 billion to restart its nuclear reactor at a Pennsylvania plant formerly known as Three Mile Island.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation  signed a deal  in late 2024 with Microsoft to restart the 835-megawatt reactor, which shut in 2019, and which would offset Microsoft’s data center electricity use. The other unit at the plant, renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, shut in 1979 after an accident that chilled the nuclear power industry.\n \n\n   \n  U.S. power demand is now rising for the first time in two decades on technologies including artificial intelligence. Nuclear energy, which is virtually carbon-free, has become an option for technology companies with uninterrupted power needs and climate pledges. Critics point out that the U.S. has failed to find permanent storage for radioactive waste.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Beard, head of the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, or LPO, said the restart would support the PJM regional grid. “This type of energy is important because it’s large, stable, affordable base load power,” Beard told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation said the loan will help it lower the cost of financing and leverage private investment to restore power to the grid.\n \n\n   \n  The LPO has more than $250 billion in capital, and “a large portion of that we expect to be deployed to help reinvigorate the large-scale nuclear reactor development,” Beard said. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said this month that the bulk of the LPO money would go to nuclear projects.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation in June had moved up the timeline to restart the reactor by about a year to 2027 after PJM fast-tracked its review process to connect the project to the grid.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation said it has hired hundreds of workers, completed infrastructure inspections and ordered major equipment for the reactor. It will need to revamp cooling towers, install a main power transformer among other equipment, and re-fuel before producing electricity.\n \n\n   \n  It was the first time the LPO declared that a company had met all conditions for a loan and closed it at the same time, Beard said. Constellation is guaranteeing the loan, he said, and that loan structure would protect taxpayers if the project does not succeed.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation is an “investment-grade” established nuclear operator that could have gotten a bank loan without the government’s help, Beard said. “But we want to show support for affordable, reliable, stable, secure energy in the U.S., as directed by President (Donald) Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The plant also needs U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and water-related permitting, Constellation said this year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/what-happens-next-epstein-bill","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:45:00-05:00","title":"Here’s the Epstein bill’s possible path in the Senate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed the House with overwhelming support, is now moving to the Senate, where it is expected to pass quickly, possibly by unanimous consent, without significant amendments.

introduced, a bill directing the Department of Justice to publicly release all its Jeffrey Epstein-related files passed the House on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Although the measure passed with near-unanimous support, it still has to pass a few hurdles before it becomes law and files are ultimately released.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what could be next for the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n \n\n   \n    The bill’s possible path in the Senate\n \n\n   \n  The legislation now moves to the Republican-led Senate, where its once-uncertain path now seems clearer.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republican leader John Thune said he expects his chamber to take the measure up “fairly quickly” – perhaps even later Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that he would move to pass the bill by unanimous consent later Tuesday, and Thune acknowledged that could be successful.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the kind of thing, probably, that could perhaps move by unanimous consent,” Thune said.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s not likely the Senate will make any changes, despite House Speaker Mike Johnson’s public request that the chamber do so.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, when a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1, and the president has said he’s going to sign it, I’m not sure that amending it is, is in the cards,” Thune said.\n \n\n   \n  If it doesn’t pass by unanimous consent, Democrats would need a few Republican senators to vote with them for the bill. A  similar measure  led by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley has two Republican cosponsors, GOP Sens. Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, as of Tuesday, according to Merkley’s office. But momentum is now fully behind the House-passed measure and Thune said his team was “hotlining” it.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson had previously told reporters he was “very confident” the Senate would methodically consider the bill and amend it to better protect people’s privacy. If the Senate were to make changes and pass the legislation by a simple majority, the House would then need to vote again on the Senate-amended version.\n \n\n   \n  But GOP Rep. Thomas Massie, the bill’s main sponsor, argued that any such change could be “just another delay tactic,” and that he felt its privacy protections were adequate as-is.\n \n\n   \n    If the bill passes the Senate\n \n\n   \n  A Senate-passed bill without changes would go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his approval.\n \n\n   \n  If the Senate were to amend it, the bill would moves to Trump’s desk after the Senate version was again passed by the House.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  has said  he will sign the bill into law. But he could also change his mind and choose to veto the bill, which would then require a two-thirds vote to override the president’s veto. He could also decide not to act on the bill, allowing it to become law without his signature.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the the bill becomes law, some lawmakers – like GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who long backed the measure – have questioned whether the Department of Justice would release the files or if the information would remain tied up in ongoing investigations.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has not directed the department to do so, according to an official familiar with the matter. But generally, the department resists giving Congress files during an ongoing criminal investigation because any public release could jeopardize the integrity of the probe or any resulting criminal case. And it’s unclear how the agency might respond if the measure was passed by Congress and signed into law.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/gluesenkamp-perez-garcia-retirement-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00Z","title":"House reprimands Democratic congressman accused of subverting election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives reprimanded retiring Democratic Rep.

Chuy García — for what some of his colleagues have described  as an attempt to subvert the election of his successor  in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  What made it even more surprising: It was a fellow Democrat who triggered the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Centrist Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington has infuriated fellow Democrats for her surprise decision last week to force the House to take up the symbolic resolution against García. The Illinois Democrat, first elected in 2018, is under attack for allegedly coordinating his own retirement to ensure his hand-picked replacement would win his seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  Garcia announced his retirement shortly after his state’s filing deadline on November 3 — after his chief of staff had declared her own candidacy. That meant the staffer, Patty Garcia, was the only Democrat running in a primary for a deep-blue Chicago seat he has held since 2019. She is now all but guaranteed to win his seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  Only 22 Democrats voted with Gluesenkamp Perez to reprimand Garcia, along with 213 Republicans. The move has enraged many House Democrats, who argue that their colleague, the moderate Democrat from Washington, is choosing to embarrass their party at a time when it is already sharply divided over ideological lines in the wake of this month’s shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  “It shouldn’t have caused as much friction as it did to speak honestly and consistently about election subversion. Congress is a legislative body, not a social club, and the American people will not accept blind calls to party loyalty in defense of an effort to deny them the right to a free and fair election,” Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement after the vote. “Representative Chuy García has had a long career of public service, and he is retiring for honorable reasons, but election subversion is wrong no matter who’s doing it.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Jeffries and Democratic leaders had been  blindsided by Gluesenkamp Perez’s move , which she announced, without informing leadership, the same day the House voted to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries and his leadership team had sought to stifle the effort, and while the Democratic leader did not formally whip his members, he and his leadership team made clear they did not support it.\n \n\n   \n  “If you are not going to run, you don’t choose your successor — no matter the work you have done beforehand,” Gluesenkamp Perez said on the House floor Monday night, condemning Garcia’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  The Illinois Democrat, however, has sharply disputed the allegations. His office has said his abrupt decision to retire came after he received troubling health news, alongside other family matters, such as his recent adoption of a grandchild after the death of his daughter in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “At a moment like this, he hopes his colleagues, especially those who speak about family values, can show the same compassion and respect that any family would want during a health crisis,” Garcia’s office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  House Democratic leaders issued a strongly worded statement on Tuesday defending Garcia and condemning the “misguided” measure, after unsuccessfully trying to kill the effort earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  “(Garcia) is a good man who has always prioritized the people he represents, even while experiencing unthinkable family tragedy. We unequivocally oppose this misguided resolution and urge our colleagues in the House Democratic Caucus to reject it,” the statement from Jeffries and his leadership team read.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Monday if he had concerns about Garcia’s actions, Jeffries argued that it was not an issue that was important to everyday Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people are focused on the high cost of living in the United States of America. That’s what they’re focused on,” Jeffries said, before adding: “I strongly support Congressman Garcia.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/texas-redistricting-trump-court-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-20:30","title":"Federal court bars Texas from using new Republican-friendly US House map in midterms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal court has blocked Texas from using its newly drawn congressional map for the 2025 midterms, ruling it likely constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.

Texas announced it would appeal to the US Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  The court ordered Texas to use its previous map, which the state enacted after the 2020 census.\n \n\n   \n  If the ruling stands, Republicans could end up on the losing end of the mid-decade redistricting fight they started.\n \n\n   \n  The new Texas map aimed to help Republicans flip five Democratic-held House seats next year, and it kicked off a rush of redistricting efforts from both parties across the country. The Justice Department has joined a similar challenge to the new Democratic-drawn map in California enacted in direct response to Texas aiming to flip five Republican-held seats.\n \n\n   \n  With House Republicans currently holding just a three-seat majority, the five seats at play in Texas could make the difference in who wins control of the House next year.\n \n\n   \n  California Democrats launched their redistricting effort in response to Texas Republicans, and an initial version of their plan would have only taken effect if Texas or another state enacted a map. But the  final ballot measure passed by California voters  contained no such trigger.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, wrote that the challengers were “likely to prove at trial that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.”\n \n\n   \n  The three-judge panel that heard the case split 2-1, with Obama appointee David Guaderrama joining Brown. Reagan appointee Jerry Smith opposed the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “The radical left is once again trying to undermine the will of the people. The Big Beautiful Map was entirely legal and passed for partisan purposes to better represent the political affiliations of Texas,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican.\n \n\n   \n  US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday, “We strongly disagree with today’s district court ruling on Texas’s redistricting map - Texas’s map was drawn the right way for the right reasons.”\n \n\n   \n    Judge criticizes a letter Trump’s DOJ sent to Texas\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s ruling centers on a letter the Trump administration sent to Texas in July in which Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the civil rights division at the Department of Justice, warned of potential legal action over the state’s map because of what it called “unconstitutional” coalition districts, or districts with a non-White majority but where no single racial group makes up a majority.\n \n\n   \n  While Brown calls DOJ’s assertion “legally incorrect,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott cited the letter when he added redistricting to a special session he’d scheduled for the legislature.\n \n\n   \n  “In doing so, the Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to draw a new U.S. House map to resolve DOJ’s concerns. In other words, the Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race,” Brown wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The map ultimately passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor—the 2025 Map—achieved all but one of the racial objectives that DOJ demanded,” Brown wrote. “The Legislature dismantled and left unrecognizable not only all of the districts DOJ identified in the letter, but also several other ‘coalition districts’ around the State.”\n \n\n   \n  Brown skewered Dhillon’s letter in his decision, writing that it’s “challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors.”\n \n\n   \n  “Indeed, even attorneys employed by the Texas Attorney General—who professes to be a political ally of the Trump Administration—describe the DOJ Letter as ‘legally() unsound,’ ‘baseless,’ ‘erroneous,’ ‘ham-fisted,’ and ‘a mess,” Brown wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Even if states aren’t required to draw certain types of districts such as coalition districts under federal civil rights law, Brown wrote that they aren’t prohibited from doing so.\n \n\n   \n  “Nor is it lawful for a legislature to purposefully target such districts for destruction,” Brown wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Before being appointed to the federal bench, Brown served for nearly two decades as a state judge, culminating in six years on the Texas Supreme Court, the state’s highest civil court.\n \n\n   \n  Abbott  celebrated  Brown’s appointment in 2019, noting that the judge had started his career as a law clerk for the governor when he was himself serving on the state Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Abbott said that he had “witnessed firsthand” Brown’s and another nominee’s “sharp legal minds and commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Abbott ripped Brown’s ruling without naming the judge. He said it was “clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.”\n \n\n   \n  Texas Democrats who fought the GOP-led effort – including by  leaving the state  to delay the passage of the map – celebrated Brown’s ruling.\n \n\n   \n  “A federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen,” said state Rep. Gene Wu, who leads the Texas House Democrats.\n \n\n   \n    The national redistricting battles play out in court\n \n\n   \n  The legal wrangling over efforts by Democrats and Republicans across the country to enact rare, mid-decade congressional maps will continue to play out in coming weeks and months. Last week, the Justice Department sued officials in California over newly enacted maps meant to give Democrats in the Golden State an edge next year. A court is set to hear arguments in that case next month.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys with the department are arguing that California’s redistricting plan, which was approved by voters in early November, was sold as a purely partisan effort, when in fact “the focus was not partisanship, but race,” which they say would be impermissible under the US Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps with a nod to the likelihood that Tuesday’s action would likely end up before the US Supreme Court, Brown began the panel’s ruling on the Texas maps by quoting Chief Justice John Roberts  in a 2007 opinion : “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”\n \n\n   \n  To date, Republican-drawn maps across four states, including Texas, have targeted a total of nine Democratic-held seats. Six of those seats have been held by Black or Latino lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the Republican redistricting efforts have argued that the GOP’s hunt for a partisan advantage in Congress has improperly diluted the voting power of racial and ethnic minorities.\n \n\n   \n  “The state of Texas is only 40 percent white, but white voters control over 73 percent of the state’s congressional seats,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement. “It’s quite obvious that Texas’s effort to redistrict mid-decade, before next year’s midterm elections, is racially motivated. The state’s intent here is to reduce the members of Congress who represent Black communities, and that, in and of itself, is unconstitutional.”\n \n\n   \n  The Texas ruling points to one of the remaining legal tools available to groups challenging redistricting efforts.\n \n\n   \n  While the Supreme Court ruled in a 2019 case that partisan gerrymandering could no longer be challenged in federal court, the opinion left open the possibility of challenging racial gerrymanders, including those that violate the 1965 Voting Rights Act – a crowning achievement of the civil rights era.\n \n\n   \n  Civil rights groups say the law has reduced racial discrimination and expanded the number of minority lawmakers not only in Congress but also in state legislatures and even schools boards.\n \n\n   \n  But the ability to bring those suits is now under threat because of a pending case from Louisiana. In that litigation, Louisiana v. Callais, a group of White voters claim that the state violated the Constitution by drawing a second Black-majority district. In other words, they argue that the 14th Amendment shouldn’t allow states to consider race when attempting to fix discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  The court’s 6-3 conservative majority signaled deep reservations with Louisiana’s new congressional map when the court  heard oral arguments in the case  in October. But it was far less clear whether the court would strike down the key provision of the Voting Rights Act entirely or seek to modify it instead.\n \n\n   \n  Just two years ago, the high court rejected similar claims raised by Alabama. In that case, a majority of the court  ordered Alabama officials to redraw  the state’s congressional map to allow an additional Black majority district.\n \n\n   \n  A decision in the Louisiana case is expected next year.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/education-department-trump-administration-changes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:37:00Z","title":"Trump Administration Accelerates Push to Dismantle Education Department as It Offloads Work to Other Agencies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has accelerated its plan to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education by transferring key offices to other federal agencies, including Labor, Health and Human Services, Interior, and State, under a co-management arrangement.

Interior.\n \n\n   \n  Administration for Children and Families Relating to the CCAMPIS Program and the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation will move to HHS and International Foreign Language Education will go to the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Education Department official said the agency is “still exploring” the best plan for other offices, like the Office for Civil Rights, the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, and Federal Student Aid – divisions whose functions impact a wide swathe of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  McMahon, who has acknowledged that only Congress has the power to eliminate the department, on Tuesday touted the changes as “one essential piece of our final mission.”\n \n\n   \n  “As we partner with these agencies to improve federal programs, we will continue to gather best practices in each state through our 50-state tour, empower local leaders in K-12 education, restore excellence to higher education, and work with Congress to codify these reforms,” she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  According to a congressional source briefed on the changes, the moves are taking place under an agreement in which personnel are sent to other agencies, but technically the Department of Education has some oversight and leadership over them.\n \n\n   \n  The senior education official referred to the arrangement as “co-management” of the shifted offices, adding that the policy and oversight will stay with the Department of Education but the process, particularly with getting grants out the door and monitoring them, will be the responsibility of the partner agency.\n \n\n   \n  There is no effective date for transitioning some staff to the other agencies nor numbers on how many staff would make the physical move from their offices at the Department of Education.\n \n\n   \n  The senior official said there would be a lag time before the changes are fully executed.\n \n\n   \n  “We are really confident that this will end up being something that provides better services, more streamlined services, reduces bureaucracy and in shifting some of these responsibilities to co-management with other agencies we are necessarily narrowing the size and scope of this federal agency in line with the president’s executive order,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  The American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents more than 2,700 Education Department employees, said the plan was unlawful and warned against diffusing the agency’s functions throughout the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “This move comes as the Administration has attempted to fire large numbers of career public servants in these very offices — and is now trying to shift their critical work to agencies with no educational expertise,” AFGE Local 252 President Rachel Gittleman said in a statement, warning that the changes “will only create more confusion for schools and colleges, deepen public distrust, and ultimately harm students and families.”\n \n\n   \n  The American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten echoed concerns about the impact on students.\n \n\n   \n  “This move is neither streamlining nor reform–it’s an abdication and abandonment of America’s future,” she said in a statement. “Rather than show leadership in helping all students seize their potential, it walks away from that responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s announcement marks the Trump administration’s latest effort to build upon the president’s campaign promise to shutter the agency.\n \n\n   \n  Early on in his second term, the administration cut  nearly half of the department’s workforce  as an initial effort to shutter it.\n \n\n   \n  The mass layoffs at the department were initially blocked by lower courts until the  Supreme Court  in July said the administration could proceed for now.\n \n\n   \n  The department, which was created by Congress in 1979 when Jimmy Carter was president, is  tasked with distributing  federal funds to schools, managing federal aid for college students, and ensuring compliance with civil rights laws, including ensuring schools accommodate students with disabilities.\n \n\n   \n  Most public-school policies, meanwhile, are a function of state government.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n

Republicans say no to redistricting despite Trump’s primary threats \n       \n  By Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:33 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Indiana Senate voted Tuesday to adjourn until January as its Republican supermajority continues to resist pressure from President Donald Trump to redraw the state’s congressional lines.\n \n\n   \n  Gov. Mike Braun responded by threatening to “compel” the Senate into a special session to vote on redistricting at Trump’s behest.\n \n\n   \n  It was the latest chapter in an  escalating intraparty battle in Indiana  over the White House’s monthslong effort to bolster the party’s US House majority in time for next year’s midterm elections. Republicans now hold seven of Indiana’s nine US House seats, and Trump is seeking new maps that would give the GOP a shot at a 9-0 sweep.\n \n\n   \n  Indiana takes on more urgency for national Republicans after  a federal court invalidated Texas Republicans’ new map  that would have given them a better shot at gaining five new seats. While Texas officials immediately moved to appeal the ruling, losing that prospective five-seat gain could put the GOP multiple seats behind Democrats in the redistricting battle Trump triggered.\n \n\n   \n  However, despite Trump taking to social media this week to threaten to back primary challenges to senators who oppose redistricting, there were no signs at the statehouse on Tuesday that the opposition would yield.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been a legislator 42 years. I’m not going to change my vote,” said Sen. Vaneta Becker, an Evansville Republican who told CNN her office has received more than 750 calls opposing redistricting and 37 in favor.\n \n\n   \n  “Hoosiers are not used to being sort of in blackmail position. It does not bode well,” Becker said.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers gathered in Indianapolis for “organization day” — the long-planned ceremonial start to the 2026 legislative session. The Senate voted 29-19 to meet again on January 5, a vote that implicitly rejected Braun’s call for a redistricting-focused special session.\n \n\n   \n  Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, a Martinsville Republican who infuriated Trump when he issued a statement saying the Senate does not have enough votes to pass new maps,  told reporters Tuesday that the adjournment vote was “fairly indicative of the vote that you might have seen” if the Senate had voted on new congressional maps.\n \n\n   \n  Trump this week has threatened to back primary opponents to take on Bray, who isn’t up for reelection until 2028, and other Republicans who opposed redistricting, arguing that they are standing in the way of the GOP retaining its majority on Capitol Hill for the last two years of Trump’s presidency. Braun responded later Tuesday afternoon with a statement backing Trump’s primary threats and suggesting he will seek to force the Senate into session to vote on redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, Sen. Rod Bray was forced to partner with DEMOCRATS to block an effort by the growing number of America First Senators who wanted to have a vote on passing fair maps. Now I am left with no choice other than to explore all options at my disposal to compel the State Senate to show up and vote,” Braun said in a statement. “I will support President Trump’s efforts to recruit, endorse, and finance primary challengers for Indiana’s senators who refuse to support fair maps.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Monday posted on Truth Social: “A RINO State Senator, Rodric Bray, who doesn’t care about keeping the Majority in the House in D.C., is the primary problem. Soon, he will have a Primary Problem, as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity.”\n \n\n   \n  Bray on Tuesday said he has had “a couple conversations” with Trump about redistricting and said he is “honored to talk to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  “Frankly, I know that he’s passionate about this issue. I’ve explained to him, as I tried to explain to you guys today, that we want to be helpful. We want to see a Republican majority in the House of Representatives. And this is the best way forward, as we see it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Bray argued that even without new maps, Republicans have a chance to win the 1st District, a traditionally blue seat in northwestern Indiana, and hold eight of Indiana’s nine House seats.\n \n\n   \n  “A number of our caucus members, myself included, don’t see this as a binary choice between the 7-2 ratio that you have right now and redistricting into an automatic 9-0,” Bray said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his political allies had launched an advertising pressure campaign aimed at forcing the state Senate’s hand.\n \n\n   \n  Some veteran Republican legislators said the primary threats rang hollow because of their constituents’ near-unanimous opposition to redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “Hoosiers are very thoughtful, and I know for myself, I represent my constituents,” Becker said.\n \n\n   \n  She added that “it’s not a good look for legislators, in my opinion, to kowtow to that.”\n \n\n   \n  But state Sen. Mike Young, a veteran Indianapolis Republican, took to the floor Tuesday to lambast Bray for refusing Braun’s call for a special session. Young said it was “a slap in the face of the governor of the state of Indiana to do something like this.”\n \n\n   \n  “Imagine waking up on Wednesday, the day after elections next November, and we find ourselves in the minority by one or two votes … knowing that we have the opportunity to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Young said. “Elections have consequences, and we won.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/clay-higgins-against-epstein-files-release","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:06:00Z","title":"Clay Higgins was the only Republican to vote against the Epstein files release.

Small businesses are facing mounting pressure from America’s affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Doug Scheffel, owner of a family-run ETM Manufacturing in Massachusetts, laid off about a quarter of his employees in April as the Trump administration’s haphazard tariff rollout dented demand for the machine parts and sheet metal his company sells.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is hunkering down and building up cash. It’s never been this bad,” Scheffel told CNN in a phone interview. “It’s very uncertain and impossible to plan in this environment.”\n \n\n   \n  Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy, accounting for the vast majority of total businesses in the nation, nearly half of all employees and the  bulk of the job growth. \n \n\n   \n  Like other small businesses, ETM Manufacturing can’t take advantage of growth opportunities because financing is so expensive.

They’re worried about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their kid,” Scheffel said. “Bad stuff happens when they’re not totally focused.”\n \n\n   \n  Scheffel’s employees are hardly alone. About one in four US households are  living paycheck to paycheck , meaning they are spending over 95% of their income on necessities like housing and groceries, according to estimates from Bank of America.\n \n\n   \n  The mood among mom-and-pop shops on Main Street is mixed. While small business owners tell CNN they are hopeful about the future and excited about how artificial intelligence can help them, some are concerned about the headaches incurred by the ever-changing trade war and high costs.\n \n\n   \n  Bryan Pate, CEO of San Diego-based PT Motion Works, an exercise equipment company that sells elliptical bikes, GIBBON SlackBoards and Indo Board balance boards, told CNN that his business is struggling to keep up with rapidly rising healthcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two decades, the average cost of single coverage health insurance  has surged by 120%  for companies with fewer than 50 employees, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), a nonprofit that advocates for small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s unbelievable how much healthcare has gone up,” Pate said, noting this is a big disadvantage small businesses have against large corporations. “It’s an unfair barrier to hiring.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘So much anxiety’\n \n\n   \n  Those healthcare and payroll expenses add to the pressure from the historic tariff hikes under President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “We just don’t know what the guy is gonna do. It creates so much anxiety and time-wasting,” Pate said of Trump’s evolving tariff policies.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has raised tariffs on US imports to an average rate of 16.8%, the highest since 1935, according to  estimates  released by The Budget Lab at Yale on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Pate said his businesses have been hammered by tariffs — including the 20% levy on Taiwan, where its bikes are manufactured.\n \n\n   \n  Ironically, the tariffs are wiping out some US manufacturing jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Pate said his company recently ended contracts with seven assembly workers based in San Diego and now employs workers in Mexico instead. And Pate plans to raise prices on bikes to offset the cost of tariffs but worries that will erode demand.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been economically painful, and long-term, if tariffs stay where they are, it’s just not going to work,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Troy Rackley, CEO at The Next Level of Performance, a Sarasota, Florida-based water treatment technology company, told CNN on the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington he has had to raise prices on some of his products due to US tariffs on imports from Australia and China.   \n \n\n   \n  Rackley dismissed the argument that exporting countries are paying US tariffs and hopes the  Supreme Court rules  against the Trump administration’s use of  emergency powers to justify  its global tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “China, Mexico and Canada don’t pay. I’m the one that’s paying for it,” Rackley said. “I pay taxes on my income, and now I have to pay additional taxes on what I bring in.”\n \n\n   \n    High borrowing costs\n \n\n   \n  Khari Parker, a graduate of the Goldman Sachs small business program and co-founder of Connie’s Chicken and Waffles in Baltimore, isn’t facing any tariff trouble, but he’s struggling to find affordable capital.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve being hit with very, very high rates of 20% to 30%,” Parker said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has worked to support small businesses by providing capital through the Small Business Administration (SBA).\n \n\n   \n  Since Trump took office, the SBA  estimates  it has approved more than 58,000 small business loans worth over $32 billion. For fiscal 2025, which closed at the end of September, the SBA said it guaranteed a record-setting $44.8 billion of small business loans.\n \n\n   \n  Small business  optimism increased  sharply after Trump took office before retreating after Trump’s tariff plans spooked financial markets, according to the NFIB. Optimism later recovered and is currently slightly above its 52-year average.\n \n\n   \n    Immigration crackdown shrinks labor pool\n \n\n   \n  One recurring struggle for small businesses like Parker’s: attracting talent.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard to find workers. We can’t always offer the same competitive benefits or pay that larger businesses can,” Parker said.\n \n\n   \n  For some companies in construction, those challenges have been amplified by the immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of the workforce is nervous from all the stuff going on with immigration,” said Antonio McMillion, president of Maryland-based developer MFP Management & Construction.\n \n\n   \n  McMillion said his company has been forced to hire more expensive workers, raising their labor costs on some projects by up to 40%.\n \n\n   \n  “Hopefully we can pass on the price to the client, but that could also mean you don’t get the job,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Pate, the CEO of PT Motion Works, is very frustrated by tariffs but remains optimistic about the future because of his employees’ resilience in the face of uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  “It could be very depressing and demoralizing,” he said, “but no one is throwing in the towel.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/middleeast/us-gaza-israel-un-vote-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:17:00Z","title":"Trump’s plan for Gaza endorsed by UN Security Council","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Security Council passed a 13–0 resolution (with abstentions by Russia and China) endorsing a U.S.-drafted plan for Gaza, which builds on Donald Trump’s 20-point ceasefire proposal.

Security Council \n       \n  By Billy Stockwell, Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:17 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The UN Security Council passed a  US-drafted resolution  Monday that aims to move beyond the fragile truce in Gaza to a more sustainable peace and the reconstruction of the devastated enclave.\n \n\n   \n  The 15-member council voted 13 to 0 in favor of the resolution, with abstentions by Russia and China, which declined to use their veto power to block the measure.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution was intended to add international legitimacy to US President Donald Trump’s  20-point Gaza plan , parts of which formed the basis of the ceasefire that took effect in the Gaza Strip last month. The United States had lobbied hard for its passage, which was praised by Trump in a lengthy post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “Congratulations to the World on the incredible Vote of the United Nations Security Council, just moments ago, acknowledging and endorsing the BOARD OF PEACE, which will be chaired by me, and include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World,” Trump wrote Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution authorized elements of the plan, including the establishment of the “Board of Peace” as a transitional authority and the creation of a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, according to a draft seen by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday that “the members of the Board, and many more exciting announcements, will be made in the coming weeks.”   \n \n\n   \n  Some diplomatic sources said the resolution will help grant the authority for countries to participate in the ISF, as it will now have UN backing.\n \n\n   \n  US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz said Monday that the ISF, “a strong coalition of peacekeepers, many from Muslim majority nations like Indonesia, Azerbaijan and others,” will deploy to Gaza “under a unified command” in order to “secure Gaza streets … oversee demilitarization … protect civilians and … escort aid through safe corridors.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, had acknowledged the need for an “international mandate” to support the plan. Ahead of the vote, Waltz warned that “a vote against this resolution is a vote to return to war.”\n \n\n   \n  Although the resolution has passed, many questions remain about its implementation, with the draft appearing vague on sequencing and detail.\n \n\n   \n  Western diplomatic sources have told CNN that the lack of detail in the resolution will make it hard to put into effect. It has faced scutiny for lacking a clear timeline for the transitional authorities to hand over to the Palestinian Authority, saying only that it will do so once the PA “has satisfactorily completed its reform program.” The resolution authorizes the Board of Peace and other authorized “international civil and security presences” until the end of 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution states that the Board of Peace will oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other factions – a key Israeli demand – and the reconstruction of Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the resolution also contains a reference to Palestinian statehood, but it provides no timeline for it.\n \n\n   \n  “After the (Palestinian Authority) reform program is faithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” the draft said.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The representative from Russia, one of the two UN Security Council members to abstain from the vote, said it was important that the resolution not become “a death knell for the two state solution.” A representative of China, the other member to abstain, argued that “it seems Palestine is barely visible in it, and the Palestinian sovereignty and ownership are not fully reflected.”\n \n\n   \n  The resolution calls on UN member states and international oragnizations to work with the Board “to contribute personnel, equipment, and financial resources to its operating entities and the ISF, to provide technical assistance to its operating entities and the ISF, and to give full recognition to its acts and documents.”\n \n\n   \n   Hamas said Sunday that it considered the draft resolution “an attempt to impose international guardianship over Gaza and promote a vision biased toward the occupation.”\n \n\n   \n  After Monday’s vote, Hamas said that giving any stabilization force “tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality and turns it into a party to the conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Palestinians in Gaza were also wary of the resolution, fearing that international forces inside Gaza could do more harm than good for the people trying to rebuild their lives in the enclave.\n \n\n   \n  “Those who are supposed to come now, God willing, may they improve everything for these people,” 38-year-old Um Shadi Al Balbasi told CNN on Tuesday. “But if they come and end up like the ones before them, no. They must be better than those who came before, because the situation, I’m telling you, is absolutely unbearable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Waltz said after the passage of the resolution that the Board of Peace “will coordinate the delivery of humanitarian assistance, facilitate Gaza’s development and support a technocratic committee of Palestinians responsible for day-to-day operations of Gaza civil service and administration while the Palestinian Authority fully implements its reform program.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials have not expanded in detail on what that reform program would look like.\n \n\n   \n  Some Hamas officials continue to rule out disarmament of the group’s military wing. Hamas fighters would be reluctant to give up light weapons to protect themselves from other groups in Gaza seeking retribution.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated Sunday that “Gaza will be demilitarized, and Hamas will be disarmed — either the easy way or the hard way.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s President Isaac Herzog called Monday’s resolution “quite an incredible moment in world politics that could only have been carved out by President Trump, and of course, bringing back all our hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to enable a future of hope, and I hope this resolution of the Security Council, plus people-to-people activities and new initiatives … should lead, hopefully, to some sort of a positive outcome,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:47:00-05:00","title":"Tracking States’ Unprecedented Redistricting Efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, President Donald Trump and Republican leaders have launched an unprecedented mid-decade redistricting effort to protect their narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

efforts \n       \n  By Amy O’Kruk, Ethan Cohen, Renée Rigdon, Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:47 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented effort this year to redraw state congressional maps to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have responded with redistricting efforts of their own, setting off a series of fights across the country — including in the courts — which will shape the midterm landscape and help determine control of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Most recently, a  federal court blocked Texas  from using its new map in next year’s midterms, ruling that it is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander and ordering Texas to use its previous map in the election. The ruling is likely to be appealed, but if it stands, Republicans could end up on the losing end of the mid-decade redistricting fight they started.\n \n\n   \n  Not all states are agreeing to redraw their maps. In Indiana, the Republican leader of the state Senate  says there isn’t enough support  to redistrict in that state. Despite that announcement, Republican Gov. Mike Braun has continued to call for the legislature to vote on a new map.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has  sued California over its newly enacted map , which was drawn by Democrats and aims to effectively wipe out potential gains made by Republicans in Texas by helping the party flip five GOP seats in the Golden State. The map was approved overwhelmingly by voters earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/meta-antitrust-suit-decision-not-monopoly","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:32:00Z","title":"Meta Scores a Win After Judge Rules the Social Media Giant Is Not an Illegal Monopoly","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. federal judge ruled that Meta is not a monopoly in the social media market, rejecting the Federal Trade Commission’s claim that the company should be forced to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp. The decision, based on testimony from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and judicial analysis of shifting market dynamics, emphasizes that platforms like TikTok and YouTube have significantly increased competition.

judge rules the social media giant is not an illegal monopoly \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:22 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Meta scored a major win on Tuesday after a federal judge ruled that it is not a social networking monopoly, shooting down an argument from the US Federal Trade Commission that it should be forced to spin off two of its most popular platforms.\n \n\n   \n  The Federal Trade Commission  sued Meta  in 2020, accusing it of violating antitrust law by acquiring nascent, would-be rivals Instagram and WhatsApp to avoid having to compete with them. The seven-week trial in the case saw testimony from a series of prominent figures, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who argued that the company has plenty of competition from platforms including YouTube and TikTok.\n \n\n   \n  Federal judge James Boasberg agreed with the company’s argument in his Tuesday opinion, saying that TikTok and YouTube prevent Meta from monopolizing the social network market.   He also noted that Meta’s apps and the social media landscape have changed since the FTC filed its case, most recently because of AI-generated content, which undermined the agency’s arguments.   \n \n\n   \n  “Meta holds no monopoly in the relevant market,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  FTC Director of Public Affairs Joe Simonson said in a statement that the agency is reviewing its options following the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply disappointed in this decision,” Simonson said. “The deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment. We are reviewing all our options.”\n \n\n   \n  A forced breakup would have been a major loss for Meta, which heavily relies on Instagram for ad revenue and WhatsApp for business subscriptions and its international prominence. Although Meta boasts 3.3 billion daily users across its platforms, Zuckerberg’s testimony during the seven-week trial  indicated that the app  with which he founded the company, Facebook, is declining in popularity.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court’s decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition,” Meta Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Newstead said in a statement provided by spokesperson Nkechi Nneji. “Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America.”\n \n\n   \n  The ruling also marks a win for Silicon Valley as US regulators increasingly seek to crack down on the power of Big Tech. Google was recently ruled a monopoly in two separate cases related to its  search  and  online advertising  businesses.  Apple  and  Amazon  are also fighting antitrust cases brought by the government.\n \n\n   \n  Meta, then known as Facebook, acquired  Instagram in 2012  for $1 billion and  WhatsApp in 2014  for $19 billion.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, lawyers for the FTC  pointed  to emails and internal documents that they said showed that Zuckerberg was concerned about competition from Instagram and WhatsApp prior to the acquisitions. They claimed that Meta’s large user base reflected a lack of “reasonable alternatives” for consumers in the social media space.\n \n\n   \n  Meta argued that regulators approved the acquisitions years ago when they were made, and that a forced breakup could harm American competitiveness in the tech space.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg’s ruling argues that Meta’s apps hold only a “modest share” of total time spent in the social media market — which includes Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, MeWe, TikTok and YouTube — and that its share is falling. He added that “even if YouTube is excluded (from the relevant market), Meta still would not hold a monopoly.” (Boasberg’s opinion redacts the specific market share he believes Meta to hold.)\n \n\n   \n  “TikTok — which Meta considers its fiercest competitor — broke into the market only seven years ago … and has been overrunning the market ever since,” Boasberg wrote.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details and context.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/karen-read-massachusetts-police-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:06:00-05:00","title":"Karen Read Files Lawsuit Alleging ‘Gross Misconduct’ by State Police in O’Keefe Death Case","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Karen Read, who was found not guilty of murder charges in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O’Keefe, has filed a civil lawsuit alleging that members of the Massachusetts State Police and several individuals at a house party conspired to cover up the true cause of death and frame her.

She was  been charged  with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a vehicle under the influence and leaving the scene.\n \n\n   \n  A  mistrial was declared  last year after jurors said they were at an impasse and deliberating further would be futile. In the second trial, a jury found her not guilty of second degree murder and manslaughter charges but did find her guilty of a lesser charge of drunken driving.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s lawsuit was filed against several members of the state police and most of the people at the house party including federal agent Brian Higgins, Nicole and Brian Albert, whose owned the house, and Jennifer and Matthew McCabe. It raises many of the allegations Read’s defense team made during her two trials.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit alleges O’Keefe was killed at the house party during an “altercation during a late night house party with other defendants after a night of heavy drinking.” It says there was a vast conspiracy by members of a well-connected and close social group in the house to cover up the crime. It also accused investigators of shoddy police work, manufacturing evidence and failing to investigate the house for blood, DNA or other evidence or interview anyone at the house.\n \n\n   \n  “The House Defendants responsible for Mr. O’Keefe’s death — some of whom had professional experience with police investigations — concocted a plan immediately after the altercation to avoid culpability and frame Ms. Read,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that state police investigators allowed those defendants to redirect the investigation away from themselves and toward Read.\n \n\n   \n  In statement from their attorneys, Higgins, the McCabes and the Alberts denied the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “The allegations made by Karen Read are entirely false, defamatory, and without merit,” they said in a statement. “Our clients categorically deny each and every claim. This lawsuit is nothing more than a continuation of a baseless conspiracy narrative that has caused significant harm to the reputations and lives of innocent people. Our clients acted responsibly, fulfilling their civic duty as witnesses, and have participated appropriately in the legal process from the outset.”\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit also alleges the investigation, led by former Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, was biased from the start. Proctor was fired after sharing offensive and sexist texts about Read with friends, family and co-workers. During the second trial, Read’s defense attorney Alan Jackson argued Proctor’s “blatant bias” tainted every aspect of the corrupt and flawed investigation.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the Karen Read Civil Team said she “was dragged through a baseless criminal prosecution engineered by individuals who abused their authority, manipulated the investigative process, and trampled her rights.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our complaint lays out, in stark detail, the malicious prosecution, the conspiracy, the civil-rights violations, and the intentional misconduct that these defendants visited upon an innocent woman,” the team added.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for the Massachusetts State Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit, among other things, alleges malicious prosecution under the Fourth Amendment and conspiracy to deprive Read of her Fourth Amendment rights.

PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Massachusetts man about to be tried for the  murder and dismemberment of his wife  pleaded guilty to lesser charges on Tuesday – but the trial went on nonetheless.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe, 50, pleaded guilty to misleading police and improper conveyance of a human body related to the death of his wife, Ana Walshe, a corporate real estate manager and mother of three. Not long after, jury selection began in his murder trial.\n \n\n   \n  In Norfolk County Superior Court Tuesday morning, Walshe’s attorney made clear he is not admitting to murdering his wife.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a plea deal from prosecutors. Prosecutors refused to negotiate, according to a defense filing, “unless negotiations included the indictment charging murder.”\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe is prepared to admit to the recitation of facts with respect to the indictment that the government just read in so far as it alleges he did impede and obstruct the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Ana Walshe. We obviously object, and he’s not admitting to … murder,” attorney Kelli Porges said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive search for Ana Walshe, 39, was launched after her employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, and her husband told investigators he’d last seen her leaving their Cohasset, Massachusetts, home for a work trip on New Year’s Day.\n \n\n   \n  He was arrested on January 8 and charged with misleading police, and later that month he was charged with her murder.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe faces a maximum sentence of 10 years on the misleading police charge, with up to a 20-year sentence enhancement if convicted of murder. He faces up to 3 years in prison on the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate federal case, Walshe pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. He’s serving a 37-month prison sentence that’s set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death. He’s been in state detention since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s body has not been found, but investigators recovered trash bags of evidence they allege Brian Walshe threw away, containing a hacksaw, a hatchet, and several items with Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood and DNA on them, prosecutors have said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators uncovered a series of chilling internet searches they say Brian Walshe made from his young son’s iPad including: “How long before a body starts to smell?” and “How to stop a body from decomposing,” according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  At the hearing Tuesday, Walshe acknowledged the prosecutors’ allegations and confirmed to the judge that he disposed of her body.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe, did you in fact, willfully remove or convey the body of Ana Walshe or her remains, not being lawfully authorized to do so?” Judge Diane Freniere said.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, Your Honor,” Walshe responded.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors allege Brian Walshe killed his wife because he  wanted to end their marriage  and that he lied to investigators about some of his actions and whereabouts in the days following her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  After Walshe’s arrest, his  defense attorney noted  no body has been found and said there was “no indication of if she died, how she died” and no murder weapon or motive established.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have said they plan to call up to 60 witnesses in the state’s case against Walshe.\n \n\n   \n  Freniere last week ruled Walshe was competent to stand trial after he spent a 40-day stint in a state hospital for mental health evaluation. The judge had delayed the trial – previously set for October 20 – so Walshe could undergo the evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  His attorneys lobbied for the trial delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concerns that Walshe could not adequately assist in his defense after the attack.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the judge said she’s accepted a physician’s report deeming Walshe competent after the evaluation period.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorney Larry Tipton said in open court the defense did not contest his competency.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the day jury selection was supposed to start.

\nUpdated: \n        2:37 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A small label installed on a wire when a giant cargo ship was built may have triggered a chain of events nearly a decade later, causing the ship to slam into a bridge and collapse into the water.\n \n\n   \n  The National Transportation Safety Board held a public meeting Tuesday to determine the probable cause of the container ship Dali crashing into the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and its subsequent collapse, killing six people.\n \n\n   \n  On March 26, 2024, the 213-million-pound cargo vessel Dali lost engine and electrical power as it was leaving the Port of Baltimore and struck a pillar of the Key Bridge.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact is, none of us should be here today,” said Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the NTSB, in her opening remarks. “This tragedy should have never occurred. Lives should have never been lost, as with all accidents that we investigate, this was preventable.”\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB said Tuesday it believes a label was put in the wrong place on a signal wire when the ship was built. That sticker, identifying the line, kept the wire from getting a good connection in a circuit breaker – which in turn ultimately caused the first blackout.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, according to Marcel Muise, the NTSB’s investigator in charge, the vessel lost steering, the ability to operate the bow thruster, key water pumps, and most of the vessel’s lighting and equipment essential for operations. That first outage lasted 58 seconds.\n \n\n   \n  The crew onboard the Dali quickly found the tripped breaker, the NTSB said. Power came back within 58 seconds, but restarting a key pump that would have provided fuel to generators had to be done manually, and that didn’t happen.  When the generators ran out of gas in their lines, the result was a second blackout.\n \n\n   \n  “To restart it, you would have to go two levels down in near total darkness with a flashlight from the engine control deck to the purifier room on the fourth deck,” Homendy said.\n \n\n   \n  The pump being used was designed to flush out lines for maintenance, but it had been operating for at least seven months. Since it was not intended to be used in this way, it did not have a backup.\n \n\n   \n  When the pump needed to be restarted, the Dali was just three ships’ lengths from the bridge and despite the pilots reacting properly, they couldn’t regain control in time to avoid hitting it, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  About 10 hours earlier, while the ship was still moored, it experienced two onboard blackouts, one caused by a crew error, according to the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  At the conclusion of Tuesday’s meeting, the board will vote to determine the probable cause of the crash and approve a final report.\n \n\n   \n    A critical minute and 29 seconds\n \n\n   \n  Six construction workers filling potholes on the bridge when the ship slammed into the bridge support might not have been killed if they had been notified to evacuate, the NTSB said in the hearing.\n \n\n   \n  The road crew was in their vehicles on the bridge when it collapsed, sending the trucks tumbling into the water. A seventh worker, who was with them, was injured in the collapse but survived. An inspector, who was outside of his vehicle walking the length of the bridge, ran to safety as it collapsed behind him.\n \n\n   \n  As the Dali veered toward the bridge, the ship notified the Maryland Transportation Authority which shut down traffic on the bridge 48 seconds before impact. The agency also had the inspector’s cell phone number, but did not warn him of the impending collision.\n \n\n   \n  “Had the highway workers been notified of the Dali’s emergency at the same time as the MDTA police officers, there would have been about 1 minute and 29 seconds to evacuate before pier 17 collapsed,” said Scott Parent, a highway factors engineer for the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  The force of the impact was nearly five times greater than the structural capacity of the pier, investigators said.\n \n\n   \n    One loose wire among thousands\n \n\n   \n  There were thousands of wires on the Dali, and the one loose wire that caused this incident would not have been easily found by the crew.\n \n\n   \n  “The Dali is almost 1,000 feet, and it’s as long as the Eiffel Tower,” Homendy said. “It’s high with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Locating a single wire that is loose among thousands of wires is like looking for a loose bolt in the Eiffel Tower.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the decade since the ship was built, the wire was exposed to vibrations and movement on the ship, which ultimately caused the disconnection, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  “This was an intermittent electrical issue failure, meaning it didn’t fail all the time,” said Barton Barnum, senior marine engineer with the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  Barnum said the NTSB left the failed system configured the way it was during the incident. The wire became disconnected again during the investigators’ simulation.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re talking about a very small component here and this is what caused all the problems,” said Thomas Chapman, NTSB board member. “The poor connection within this terminal block is what started the sequence of events that resulted in the blackout.”\n \n\n   \n  It would have been nearly impossible to check every connection, but thermal imaging would have helped identify the problem in a shorter timeframe, the NTSB noted.\n \n\n   \n    Bridge was at risk of collapse in a collision, but no one knew\n \n\n   \n  The Key Bridge had nearly 30 times the acceptable level of risk for critical bridges of collapse if it were hit, based on guidance established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, NTSB officials said. But no one knew that before the collapse, because the owner of the bridge, the Maryland Transportation Authority, never evaluated that risk.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the NTSB also identified 68 other bridges in 19 states spanning waterways frequented by cargo ships that, like the Key Bridge, were built before 1991 and do not have a current vulnerability assessment.\n \n\n   \n  Among those on the list are the Golden Gate Bridge in California; Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, George Washington and Verrazzano-Narrows bridges in New York City; the Walt Whitman and Benjamin Franklin bridges in Pennsylvania; the Sunshine Skyway in Florida and the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  The Maryland Transportation Authority on Monday  said  in a release the updated cost estimate to replace the Key Bridge is now projected to be $4.3 billion to $5.2 billion, with an expected opening in late 2030 – a two-year delay from the earlier estimate.\n \n\n   \n  That price tag is more than double the previous expected cost of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, which the Maryland Department of Transportation  previously confirmed  to CNN.\n \n\n   \n    17 Safety Recommendations\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB also proposed 17 safety recommendations to prevent another similar crash.\n \n\n   \n  The groups receiving the recommendations, including the ship’s owner, bridge owners, Coast Guard, American National Standards Institute, and others are not required to follow the recommendations, but are strongly encouraged to.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hearts are with you as we work diligently over the next several days, weeks, months and years to make sure our safety recommendations are implemented and to ensure that this never happens again so another family never has to suffer the same pain that you all have suffered,” Homendy told family members of victims in the crowd as she closed Tuesday’s meeting.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Michelle Watson contributed to this report.   \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/media/trump-cnn-big-lie-defamation-lawsuit-appeals","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"14:15:00-05:00","title":"Federal Appeals Court Rejects Trump’s ‘Meritless’ Case Against CNN","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal appeals court has rejected President Donald Trump’s defamation lawsuit against CNN, calling his claims 'meritless' and affirming a prior 2023 district court ruling that Trump failed to prove the falsity of statements about the 2020 election.

President Donald Trump’s attempt to revive a defamation lawsuit against CNN, calling his arguments “meritless.”\n \n\n   \n  The 2022 suit objected to CNN’s use of the phrase “the big lie” in

The Dow fell 499 points, or 1.07%. The S&P 500 fell 0.83%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.21%.\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 closed lower for the fourth day in a row, marking its longest daily losing streak since August.\n \n\n   \n  Just six weeks after notching a record high above $126,000, bitcoin has plummeted more than 26%.

The risk-off attitude is weighing on bitcoin, a highly speculative and volatile investment.\n \n\n   \n  In Wall Street terms, bitcoin is in a bear market — when a price falls more than 20% from a recent peak. Bitcoin has shed more than $600 billion in market value during its tumble, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin’s pullback is part of a broader shift in risk sentiment,” said Haider Rafique, global managing partner at OKX, a crypto exchange.\n \n\n   \n  After a strong six-month rally in stocks, nerves are mounting about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies.

Amazon shares ( AMZN ) fell 4.43% and Microsoft shares ( MSFT ) fell 2.7%.\n \n\n   \n  The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 6.6% since hitting a record high late October and has shed roughly $2.6 trillion in market value during its slide.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 10% on Tuesday.  CNN’s Fear and Greed index  hovered in “extreme fear” and slid to its lowest level since early April.\n \n\n   \n    Bitcoin bear market\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the pressure on bitcoin: Long-term investors may be closing their positions to lock in profits after meteoric gains in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin has struggled as a result of selling pressure from long-term holders taking profits but also uncertainty around Fed policy, the liquidity environment and other macro conditions,” said Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin has struggled to meaningfully recover since a  flash crash  on October 10 when President Donald Trump reignited his trade war with China. Some buyers and sellers have left the market since then, so there are fewer orders for bitcoin, leaving the price more susceptible to volatility, according to Peter Chung, head of Presto Research.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin is under pressure in line with other risk assets (see the price actions of the AI stocks), but its downside is amplified due to a crypto-specific factor — namely, the orderbooks have gotten thinner in the aftermath of the (October 10) liquidations, which hurt many market makers in the space,” Chung said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Bitcoin’s roundtrip — for now\n \n\n   \n  Up until recent weeks, it had been a relatively strong year for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $69,000 ahead of Trump’s reelection in November before surging about 83% — amid bouts of volatility — to its record high above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin  surpassed $100,000  for the first time in early December 2024 as investors leaned in to optimism about the Trump administration ushering in crypto-friendly regulations.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has embraced the cryptocurrency industry and his administration has loosened oversight and advocated for pro-crypto legislation. The  GENIUS Act  was passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump in July, ushering in a new era of regulation for  stablecoins , another kind of crypto.\n \n\n   \n  Trump tapped Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto regulator, to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, and cryptocurrencies continue to enter the mainstream, with new exchange-traded products giving investors easier access to buying and selling crypto.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin traded around $94,000 entering the year. It has now wiped out its gains over the past 11 months. By comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 is up 12.5% this year. Gold prices are up 54%.\n \n\n   \n  While tech stocks have also come under pressure, investors have been swooping in to the buy the dip. Nvidia ( NVDA ) on Friday tumbled as much as 3.36% before finishing the day higher by 1.77%. Nvidia on Monday fell as much as 3.08% before finishing the day lower by just 1.88%.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, bitcoin is still languishing around $93,000 and has yet to see a meaningful rebound. Some analysts say the crypto market is at an inflection point, where the positive catalysts this year have been priced in while there is increasing uncertainty about the outlook.\n \n\n   \n  “How the market behaves over the next several days will signal whether this becomes a deeper reset or just a sharp, temporary dip in an otherwise intact cycle,” Rafique at OKX said.\n \n\n   \n  Some crypto investors are still optimistic. Bitcoin in April had tumbled as low as about $74,500 before surging above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, some investors see sideways churn and get spooked,” said Ryan Rasmussen, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management. “But in our view it’s the perfect opportunity for investors to build on existing bitcoin positions, and for those who have been sidelined to enter the market.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/best-christmas-markets-world","dateOfPublication":"2024-10-10","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"U.S. and Allies Escalate Military Actions in Indo-Pacific Amid Rising Tensions with China","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States and its allies have escalated military operations and strategic partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, primarily in response to increased Chinese naval presence and maritime claims.

\n  By Tamara Hardingham-Gill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:28 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There’s nothing quite like a festive market to bring out the Christmas spirit in people.\n \n\n   \n  While these events can be traced back to Vienna — the Austrian city’s first recorded  December market was in 1298  — the tradition has spread across the world over the centuries.\n \n\n   \n  From  Germany  and Switzerland to  Singapore  and  New York , it’s difficult to find a coveted destination that doesn’t hold an impressive annual market. In fact, some have grown so popular that they’ve become tourist attractions in their own right.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s CNN Travel’s rundown of some of the top Christmas markets taking place around the world this year:\n \n\n   \n    Wiener Christkindlmarkt, Austria\n \n\n   \n  With a reindeer train, a giant Ferris wheel and a giant Advent wreath, Vienna’s magical spectacle encapsulates the festive spirit fantastically.\n \n\n   \n  Although the Austrian capital holds around 20 Christmas markets, Wiener Christkindlmarkt (or Rathausplatz) is one of its oldest and most traditional events.\n \n\n   \n  The event, also known as Viennese Dream Christmas Market, is held in front of City Hall and features a 110-square-meter children’s ice rink. The famous Tree of Hearts, a giant maple tree decked out with hundreds of glittering hearts, is a favorite with visitors and a great photo opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  Plenty of stalls   offer tasty treats such as Austrian sausages and gingerbread cookies, along with homemade Christmas punch.\n \n\n   \n   Wiener Christkindlmarkt  runs from November 14 to December 26.   The ice rink, or Ice Dream at the Christmas Market, will be open until January 6, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Basel Christmas Market, Switzerland\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to find a destination that does Christmas better than Switzerland.\n \n\n   \n  Most Swiss towns are taken over by festive markets at this time of year, and the atmosphere is incredible. Basel Christmas Market is the biggest and arguably the best around.\n \n\n   \n  Separated into two sections, at Barfüsserplatz and Münsterplatz, it hosts around 150 decorated stalls selling everything from Christmas spices, decorations and candles.\n \n\n   \n  Family attractions include the Christmas fairytale forest at Münsterplatz with activities such as gingerbread and candle decorating, a star-making workshop and a puppet show.\n \n\n   \n  Attendees can take a walk up the stairwell of St. Martin’s tower for views of the lights illuminating the old town or sip on mulled wine at the Christmas pyramid on Barfüsserplatz.\n \n\n   \n   Basel Christmas Market  opens on November 27 and is scheduled to run until December 23. \n \n\n   \n    Strasbourg Christmas Market, France\n \n\n   \n  One of Europe’s oldest Christmas markets,  Strasbourg’s  began back in 1570, but has evolved considerably since then.\n \n\n   \n  Spread over more than 10 locations, the hugely popular market lights up the city with thousands of twinkling lights and festive ornaments.\n \n\n   \n  Drawing in over 2 million people a year, it features hundreds of wooden chalet stalls selling everything from decorations and presents to local Alsatian wine.\n \n\n   \n  Place Kleber is probably its most popular spot thanks to the Great Christmas Tree. But visitors will be treated to countless magical sights while wandering through the city’s narrow alleyways and pretty squares.\n \n\n   \n   Strasbourg Christmas Market  begins on November 26 and closes on December 24. \n \n\n   \n    Brussels Winter Wonders, Belgium\n \n\n   \n  Brussels really comes to life at Christmas time thanks to Winter Wonders, which is more akin to a festival than a market.\n \n\n   \n  One of Belgium’s biggest and most popular events, the annual extravaganza extends across the open spaces of the Bourse, Place de la Monnaie, Grand Place, Place Sainte Catherine and Marche aux Poissons.\n \n\n   \n  A light and sound show, ice skating and fairground rides are among the activities and places to enjoy. Visitors can also browse through about 200 chalets serving  glühwein  (mulled wine), Belgian beers and waffles while staring in wonder at the enormous Christmas tree in Grand Place.\n \n\n   \n   Brussels Winter Wonders  will run from November 28  to January 5. \n \n\n   \n    Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square Christmas markets, Prague, Czech Republic\n \n\n   \n  To say the city of Prague goes all out at Christmas is an understatement. The Czech capital is the very definition of a winter wonderland during the festive period.\n \n\n   \n  While there’s no shortage of markets throughout the city, the main ones can be found in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. Thankfully these spots are only a few minutes’ walk apart, so revelers can easily visit both in a day.\n \n\n   \n  Old Town Square provides entertainment in the form of live shows, dance performances and creative workshops. Wenceslas Square is great for handmade gifts and local treats such as klobasa (Czech sausage) and mulled wine.\n \n\n   \n   The markets will be open from November 29 to January 6, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Fira de Santa Llucia, Barcelona\n \n\n   \n  Dating from 1786, Fira de Santa Llucia has grown from a one-day event to commemorate the December 13 feast day of Santa Llucia to a three-week fair.\n \n\n   \n  Held right outside Barcelona Cathedral, the bustling market is separated into four sections.\n \n\n   \n  The first is Nativity and Figurines, where visitors can pick up decorations and models to create traditional Bethlehem manger scenes. The Greenery and Plants section is packed with both natural and artificial trees and, of course, plants.\n \n\n   \n  The Crafts section features handmade products and jewelry, while the Simbombes section is mainly made up of musical instruments.\n \n\n   \n  There are also many festive activities such as storytelling, a Christmas parade and the  Caga Tió , an enormous, piñata-style Christmas log that spills out candy and gifts when beaten with a stick.\n \n\n   \n   Fira de Santa Llucia  will be taking place from November 28 to December 23. \n \n\n   \n    I Mercati Natale, Piazza Santa Croce, Florence\n \n\n   \n  There’s much to see at this enchanting market, but nothing can top the beautiful backdrop supplied by Santa Croce’s Franciscan Basilica.\n \n\n   \n  Although this traditional fair, also known as Weihnachtsmarkt, is based on German street markets, it’s a very Italian affair in many ways thanks to the scenery and the many local treats, such as panforte, for sale.\n \n\n   \n  However, there’s certainly no shortage of gingerbread, strudel and traditional Heidelberg Lebkuchen cookies.\n \n\n   \n  Those who take a walk to the nearby Piazza del Duomo will be treated to a magnificent nativity scene, as well as an impressive Christmas tree that’s lit up ahead of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8.\n \n\n   \n   I Mercati Natale  begins on November 15 and runs to December 24. \n \n\n   \n    Advent in Zagreb, Croatia\n \n\n   \n  It’s easy to see why Zagreb was voted the “best Christmas market destination” in travel portal European Best Destinations’ online poll for three consecutive years.\n \n\n   \n  Made up of around 25 Christmas markets spread across the Croatian capital, Advent in Zagreb is a magical sight.\n \n\n   \n  Think live Nativity scenes, ice sculpture carvings, outdoor gigs, pop-up bars and a Christmas tram complete with Santa and his elves.\n \n\n   \n  Advent in Zagreb also has an area devoted to “fooling around” (or “fuliranje”) where you’ll find delighted revelers dancing in the street while eating street food and listening to live entertainment.\n \n\n   \n   Advent in Zagreb 2025  is scheduled to run from November 29 to January 7. \n \n\n   \n    Christmas in Tivoli, Copenhagen, Denmark\n \n\n   \n  Visited several times by Walt Disney before he developed Disneyland, this Danish amusement park and pleasure garden is a dazzling place to visit any time of year.\n \n\n   \n  But you’ll struggle to find anywhere as enchanting as Tivoli Gardens during the festive period.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 1,000 beautifully decorated Christmas trees adorning the beautiful grounds, and everything from fairground rides to a traditional Pixie Band for entertainment, it’s a winter experience like no other.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s line up of activities also includes a magical light installation of luminous “fireworks.”\n \n\n   \n  The annual Lucia procession on December 13, where more than 100 girls process through the gardens carrying candles and singing to mark St. Lucia’s Day, is a particular highlight, along with the firework displays that take place between December 25 and 26, as well as New Year’s Eve.\n \n\n   \n   Christmas in Tivoli  is taking place from November 14 to January 4. \n \n\n   \n    Tallinn Christmas Market, Estonia\n \n\n   \n  The Estonian capital’s annual affair is one of the more modern European Christmas markets.\n \n\n   \n  Set inside Tallinn’s Town Hall Square, it’s packed full of stalls with traditional Estonian cuisine, artisan bread and handicrafts for sale.\n \n\n   \n  On the entertainment front, there are carousels, a winter grotto and a Santa who rolls up on a sleigh complete with reindeer.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors are also treated to performances by dance troupes and choirs.\n \n\n   \n  But as with many such markets, the Christmas tree is the main event. Tallinn’s tree has been displayed here since 1441.\n \n\n   \n   Tallinn Christmas Market 2025  is due to take place from November 21 to December 28. \n \n\n   \n    Skansen’s Christmas Market, Stockholm\n \n\n   \n  Stockholm isn’t exactly lacking when it comes to Christmas markets, but none are more traditional than Skansen.\n \n\n   \n  Set on the island of Djurgarden in the world’s oldest open-air museum, it’s a wonderful exhibit of Swedish culture with some added yuletide magic.\n \n\n   \n  The historical houses on display in the museum are decked out in colorful decorations for the occasion, and all the tables inside are set up for Christmas dinner.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors can join the dancing games around the tree at Bollnäs Square, Skansen’s main site.\n \n\n   \n   Skansen’s Christmas Market  is open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from November 28 until December 21. \n \n\n   \n    Tuomaan Markkinat, Helsinki\n \n\n   \n  This wonderfully Nordic Christmas market is held in Helsinki’s Senate Square, near the Emperor Alexander II statue.\n \n\n   \n  Tuomaan Markkinat’s centerpiece is a vintage carousel, but the countless vendors selling traditional Christmas delicacies,  glögi  (Finland’s take on mulled wine) and handicrafts are also a big draw.\n \n\n   \n  Younger attendees can visit Santa Claus, who has his own wooden cabin here, and join festive activities such as Christmas cookie decorating. The market’s food court is particularly impressive with a host of top eateries from which to choose.\n \n\n   \n   Tuomaan Markkinat  is set to run from November 28 to December 22, 2025.  \n \n\n   \n    St. Stephen’s Basilica and Vörösmarty Square markets, Budapest, Hungary\n \n\n   \n  Budapest has two main festive markets: St. Stephen’s Basilica Christmas market, or  Advent Bazilika , and Vörösmarty Square Christmas market.\n \n\n   \n  The former takes place in front of the famous basilica, where crowds gather to watch the regular 3D light shows that are projected onto its facade. In addition, there are around 150 stalls with vendors selling sweet treats, wine and arts and crafts.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Vörösmarty Square market is positioned in the heart of the city and attracts more than 800,000 visitors annually.\n \n\n   \n  Its main highlight is usually a giant Advent calendar that reveals a new window display on a daily basis from December 1 to 23, although the  Hungarian foods that line its stalls — langos and chimney cake — are also particular standouts.\n \n\n   \n   Advent Bazilika opens on November 14 and runs to January 1. \n \n\n   \n   The Vörösmarty   Square Christmas market will open on November 14 and close on December 31. \n \n\n   \n    Christkindlesmarkt and Gendarmenmarkt, Germany\n \n\n   \n  Open-air winter street markets have long been associated with Germany, and the European country is home to some of the oldest and most visited festive markets.\n \n\n   \n  Capital city Berlin has around 80 of them, but Gendarmenmark is perhaps its most renowned.\n \n\n   \n  Positioned between the Franzosischer Dom and Deutscher Dom, it’s a maze of wooden huts with bratwurst, mulled wine and ginger bread for sale, along with special Christmas gifts. Visitors can enjoy nightly concerts with dance and musical performances.\n \n\n   \n  In Nuremberg, Bavaria’s second-largest city, the famous Christkindlesmarkt has been around since the 16th century. During the Christmas period, around 200 stalls are erected in the city’s central market square, and the whole area is abuzz with activity.\n \n\n   \n  The market usually draws in around 2 million people every year and is undoubtedly one of Nuremberg’s annual highlights.\n \n\n   \n   Nuremberg Christkindlesmarkt 202 5  kicks off on November 28 and ends on December 24. \n \n\n   \n   Gendarmenmarkt   opens on November 24 and is set to close on December 31 .\n \n\n   \n    Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, London\n \n\n   \n  Hyde Park Winter Wonderland is one of the most highly anticipated winter events in the UK capital.\n \n\n   \n  The festive favorite, which began in 2005, brings in huge crowds every year thanks to its 200-plus fairground rides, including a 70-meter-high big wheel, mulled wine stations and an outdoor skating rink.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors can also join ice sculpting workshops, watch a circus show, listen to live music at the lively Fire Pit bar or tuck into some of the many foods on offer at the Street Food Village.\n \n\n   \n   Hyde Park Winter Wonderland  is scheduled to open on November 14 and will continue until January 1, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Edinburgh at Christmas, Scotland\n \n\n   \n  From an ice rink to immersive light displays, the Scottish capital’s historic city center is abuzz with festive markets and attractions throughout winter.\n \n\n   \n  Over in popular urban park East Princes Street Garden, there’s a traditional Christmas market with up to 70 stalls, a Ferris wheel and an 80-meter star flyer fairground ride — the world’s largest transportable star flyer.\n \n\n   \n  Revelers are treated to spectacular views of the iconic Scott Monument, along with Edinburgh Castle, where the after-dark Castle of Light attraction will be held from late November to early January.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a Christmas tree maze can be found at St. Andrew Square Garden and new attraction, the Ice Queen’s Castle, which features ice carvings and wall etchings, will be erected on George Street, one of the city’s top shopping spots.\n \n\n   \n   The Christmas market at East Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh’s main festive market, will be open from November 15 until January 4, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Krakow Christmas Market, Poland\n \n\n   \n  Stretched across a huge section of Rynek Glowny, the Polish city’s central square, Krakow Christmas Market is among the largest in Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Historic landmark St. Mary’s Basilica serves as a stunning backdrop to the yearly event, which has been around since the early 14th century, as does the Renaissance Cloth Hall.\n \n\n   \n  Revelers can tuck into Polish delicacies such as  kiełbasa  (sausage), shop for handcrafted gifts or treats and take in live music from folk bands and carol singers.\n \n\n   \n  The market usually hosts a competition in which participants, including schoolchildren and local artists, create small Nativity scenes, or cribs. They are displayed at the statue of Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, situated in the square, before a winner is chosen.\n \n\n   \n   Krakow Christmas Market  will be held from November 28 to January 1 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Bratislava Christmas Fair, Slovakia\n \n\n   \n  Dotted across various locations around the Slovakian capital, including the Main Square and Franciscan Square, the Bratislava Christmas Fair is a  magical affair.\n \n\n   \n  With stalls selling everything from mulled wine to traditional delicacies, a huge Christmas tree and live performances, the annual market showcases some of the best traditions of the Slovakian Christmas season.\n \n\n   \n  While there are various ways to reach the main event, a ride on the free Christmas tram, which runs through the city center throughout the festive period, is probably the most fun method.\n \n\n   \n   Bratislava Christmas Fair  will be held from November 27 to January 6. \n \n\n   \n    Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bay, Singapore\n \n\n   \n  Now in its 12th year, Singapore’s Christmas Wonderland is continuing to grow in popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Staged at the famous Gardens by the Bay nature park, the event lasts around four weeks and covers more than 27,000 square meters.\n \n\n   \n  Packed with attractions, it features fairground rides, a Christmas train, light and sound shows, carnival games and live performances.\n \n\n   \n  The Spalliera, a magnificent design inspired by Mesola Castle in northern Italy is one of the main highlights, along with the stunning Walk of Lights, which is illuminated by countless bulbs.\n \n\n   \n   Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bay   opens on November 29 and closes on January 1. \n \n\n   \n    The Distillery Winter Village, Toronto\n \n\n   \n  Formerly known as the Toronto Christmas Market, the Distillery Winter Village is an intimate and charming take on the traditional European festive market.\n \n\n   \n  Held in the historic Distillery District, it features outdoor shopping cabins and food vendors, Christmas carol sing-a-longs, and a special village inspired by “Bad Hats’ Narnia,” an adaptation of C.S. Lewis’s “The Lion, the witch and the Wardrobe.”\n \n\n   \n  Visitors will be able to find everything from artisanal food, handcrafted gifts and festive drinks at the numerous stalls across the market.\n \n\n   \n   The Distillery Winter Village 2025  will be open on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from November 13 to January 4. \n \n\n   \n    Winter Village at Bryant Park, New York\n \n\n   \n  Every year, Manhattan’s Bryant Park is transformed into a magnificent wonderland for the Winter Village.\n \n\n   \n  The renowned open-air market includes over 150 custom-designed kiosks and a 17,000-square-foot outdoor ice rink that’s free to use provided you have your own skates.

Mortensen, Charlotte Reck, and Char Reck, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:11 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Polish officials have pointed the finger at Russia after a key train track was destroyed in what Warsaw said was an “unprecedented act of sabotage” committed by two Ukrainian citizens who were “collaborating with Russian services.”\n \n\n   \n  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday that the two perpetrators, who have since fled to Belarus, were identified by the country’s security services following “intensive work.”\n \n\n   \n  Tusk said on Monday that the train track between the Polish cities of Warsaw and Lublin was destroyed after an “explosive device” blew it up.\n \n\n   \n  “We are certain that the attempt to blow up the tracks and the violation of railway infrastructure were intentional and aimed at causing a catastrophe in rail traffic,” the Polish leader said in the Sejm, Poland’s parliamentary lower house.\n \n\n   \n  “The established perpetrators are two Ukrainian citizens who have been collaborating with Russian services for some time. Their identities are known,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Tusk said earlier that the rail was “crucially important for delivering aid to Ukraine” and that the attack “directly (targeted) the security of the Polish state and its civilians.”\n \n\n   \n  Destruction was also identified along the same route further down the railway line, he said on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin rejected Tusk’s claim of Russian collusion Tuesday, citing “Russophobia” as the driving force behind the accusation.\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, “Russia is being blamed for all manifestations of hybrid warfare and outright warfare taking place in Poland … Russophobia is flourishing there.”\n \n\n   \n  Rebuffing Poland’s allegation, Peskov added, “The very fact that Ukrainian citizens are again involved in acts of sabotage and terrorism against critical infrastructure is significant. … If I were in the shoes of the Poles, the Germans or the French, I would think twice.”\n \n\n   \n  At a press conference Monday afternoon, Poland’s interior minister Marcin Kierwiński said that two separate incidents took place over the weekend – one confirmed act of sabotage, and one that was deemed “highly probable” to be sabotage. No arrests have been made so far in relation to the incidents.\n \n\n   \n  Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, said that threats to Europe’s security are “real and growing.” The continent “must urgently boost capacity to protect our skies and our infrastructure,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Estonia’s Prime Minister Kristen Michal strongly condemned the damage to the train track,  writing on X  that his country stands with Poland.\n \n\n   \n  “Those behind hostile acts against (European Union) and NATO members must be exposed. Our response must be united,” Michal said.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also offered his country’s solidarity with Poland, offering support if needed.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian government condemned the “sabotage” and said Russia was trying to shift the blame onto Ukraine. In a statement on Tuesday, the foreign ministry accused Russia of cynically recruiting Ukrainian passport holders to do its bidding. Several European countries including the United Kingdom and Germany have previously arrested, charged and, in some cases, convicted Ukrainian nationals for Russian-ordered attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope investigation will provide answers and we also stand ready to assist if called upon,” Sybiha said. “Could have been another hybrid attack by Russia - to test responses. If true, they need to be strong.”\n \n\n   \n  Tusk vowed that his country “will catch the perpetrators, whoever they are,” without saying who he believed was responsible for the damage.\n \n\n   \n    String of suspected Russian attacks\n \n\n   \n  The explosion, which did not cause any injuries according to Tusk, is the latest in a string of incidents in Europe that have left the continent on high alert.\n \n\n   \n  Several European nations have reported incursions into their airspace in recent months, with most pointing the finger at Russia. The Kremlin has denied involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, the European Commission adopted stricter rules on issuing visas to Russian nationals, citing safety risks related to Russia’s war on Ukraine as the reason for doing this.\n \n\n   \n  “We now face unprecedented drone disruptions and sabotage on our soil. We have a duty to protect our citizens,” Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  A research paper by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) suggested that Russia is carrying out a “campaign of sabotage, vandalism, espionage and covert action” to destabilize European governments.\n \n\n   \n  Incidents within this alleged campaign include the deliberate damaging of undersea cables, the targeting of telecommunications towers and arson plots,  IISS said .\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with the outlet Polsat News on Sunday, Poland’s Deputy Interior Minister Maciej Duszczyk said that his country has been confronted with varying acts of sabotage for some time, according to the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n \n\n   \n  Last year, an  enormous fire  destroyed a shopping center in Warsaw. Polish authorities announced in May that this was the result of arson ordered by Russian intelligence services, though Russia had previously denied allegations of orchestrating arson and sabotage operations across Europe.\n \n\n   \n  While “someone must have damaged” the train track, Duszczyk said, he also warned against immediately assigning the blame to Russia, PAP reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia is not so powerful that every arson, every situation of this type, is provoked by Russia. However, this cannot be ruled out or underestimated in any way,” he said, according to PAP.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s Internal Security Agency is working alongside police, the prosecutor’s office and railway services to investigate the matter, Polish politician Tomasz Siemoniak  said on X .\n \n\n   \n  Poland’s National Security Committee will hold a meeting on Tuesday morning, with military commanders, heads of services and the president’s representative in attendance, Tusk said.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/uk/britain-china-spy-linkedin-mi5-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"13:13:00-05:00","title":"Chinese spies using LinkedIn to target British lawmakers, MI5 warns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"MI5 has issued a stark warning that China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) is using LinkedIn to target UK parliamentarians under the guise of recruitment, aiming to collect sensitive political and legislative information.

lawmakers, MI5 warns \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:13 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s domestic spy service, MI5, warned lawmakers on Tuesday that China’s intelligence services are posing as recruiters to target people who work in Parliament, just weeks after the collapse of a case against two British nationals accused of spying for Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  In an alert, MI5 said that the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) was using websites like LinkedIn to build relationships with parliamentarians, in an effort to “collect sensitive information on the UK to gain strategic advantage.”\n \n\n   \n  Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker of the House of Commons, circulated the MI5 alert to Members of Parliament (MPs) and warned that Chinese state actors were “relentless” in their efforts to “interfere with our processes and influence activity at Parliament.” He listed two headhunters known to use LinkedIn profiles to “conduct outreach at scale” on behalf of Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  “Let me speak plainly: this activity involves a covert and calculated attempt by a foreign power to interfere with our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests, and this government will not tolerate it,” Security Minister Dan Jarvis told Parliament.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese embassy in London dismissed the claims as “pure fabrication and malicious slander.” It said it had urged Britain to “stop this self-staged charade of false accusations,” which it said was undermining relations between the countries.\n \n\n   \n  MI5’s warning comes after prosecutors last month abruptly abandoned a case against two British men  charged  with spying on MPs for Beijing, claiming that the government’s evidence was missing a “critical element” which meant there was “no other option” but to collapse the case.\n \n\n   \n  That “critical element,” prosecutors claimed, was the government’s refusal to call China an “enemy” or “national security threat.” Because the two men – Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, an academic – were charged under the Official Secrets Act 1911, they could only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy. Because the British government had not labeled China an “enemy,” prosecutors said they had to drop the case.\n \n\n   \n  Downing Street said no minister, member of the government or special adviser was involved. Instead, Prime Minister Keir Starmer blamed the previous Conservative government, which was in power at the time of the alleged offenses, for wording its policies “very carefully” so as not to describe China as an enemy.\n \n\n   \n  Still, in the wake of the collapse of the case, Starmer was accused of prioritizing the relationship with Beijing over threats to Britain’s national security. The episode raised questions about Britain’s ability to balance the need to defend itself from espionage and interference while remaining economically engaged with the world’s second-largest economy. The Chinese embassy rejected the “baseless” allegations.\n \n\n   \n  After the collapse, MI5 chief Ken McCallum said Chinese spies posed a daily national security threat to Britain. “When it comes to China, the UK needs to defend resolutely against threats and seize the opportunities that demonstrably serve our nation,” he said in his annual threat update in October.\n \n\n   \n  Without referencing the collapse of the spy case, McCallum said that the National Security Act of 2023 had addressed “longstanding weaknesses” in British legislation and “strengthened our hand against state-backed threats.”\n \n\n   \n  Jarvis, the security minister, said the latest attempts to use headhunters to spy on MPs “builds on a pattern” of hostile activity in recent years. He cited how Beijing-linked actors targeted parliamentarians’ emails in 2021 and “attempted foreign interference activity” in 2022 by Christine Lee, a British lawyer accused by MI5 of spying for Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  MI5’s latest warning comes weeks before the government must decide whether to approve a  huge new Chinese embassy in London . The decision was delayed in August after Beijing refused to explain why the plans contained blacked out areas, and critics have long said the planned complex would pose a security issue. China said Britain had shown a “total lack of spirit of contract” in delaying its decision.\n \n\n   \n  Alicia Kearns, the Conservative shadow security minister, called on the government to refuse permission for the embassy and said ministers should cancel planned trips to China.\n \n\n   \n  “What message does it send when, despite an attack on this House and our Parliament, ministers are happily jetting off to stride down red carpets with the government responsible?” Kearns said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/media/podcast-charts-apple-joe-rogan-mel-robbins","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"There’s a new No. 1 podcast in America, Apple says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Apple has updated its podcast rankings, with 'The Joe Rogan Experience' rising to No. 1, dethroning 'The Daily' which now sits at No. 2.

list of most popular podcast shows last year, moved up to first place this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The Daily,” from The New York Times, was #2 this year, followed by “The Mel Robbins Podcast,” which wasn’t in the top 10 at all in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Apple, which has an outsized place in the podcast ecosystem, released the top 10 ranking and several  related lists  on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Two other shows broke into the top 10 this year: Alex Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy,” at #7, and “The Ezra Klein Show,” another New York Times podcast, at #10.\n \n\n   \n  “Crime Junkie,” “Dateline NBC,” “SmartLess,” “This American Life,” “Huberman Lab” were all returning hits this year.\n \n\n   \n  Rogan remains the envy of the podcasting world, with two-to-three-hour-long sessions that routinely draw many millions of listeners and viewers.\n \n\n   \n  “The Joe Rogan Experience” currently ranks #1 on YouTube’s weekly podcast chart, as well, closely followed by “The MeidasTouch Podcast,” hosted by three brothers who are outspoken opponents of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Rogan’s remarks about Trump have been closely scrutinized this year, since the podcaster endorsed the president for re-election but has been critical of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement effort and other controversies.\n \n\n   \n  While a few of the most popular podcast hosts, like Rogan and Klein, spend lots of time talking about politics, many of the top shows on Apple’s list are about unsolved crimes and other mysteries.\n \n\n   \n  And several of the new breakout shows this year are celebrity-driven chat shows, like “Good Hang with Amy Poehler” and “Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce.”\n \n\n   \n  Apple’s ranking of the top individual episodes of the year shows a range of topics: The #1 episode was from “The Telepathy Tapes,” #2 was from “Crime Junkie,” #3 was Taylor Swift’s appearance on “New Heights,” #4 was Elon Musk’s visit with Rogan, and #5 was a Trump-focused episode of “The Daily.”\n \n\n   \n   A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter.

House on Tuesday — the same day Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  visits for a full day of events with the president , two White House officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Ronaldo, who plays in the Saudi Pro League, has scored 143 international goals for Portugal and is the first male player to score at five World Cups. Earlier this year, he became the  sport’s first billionaire player  following a contract he signed with Al Nassr, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n \n\n   \n  Ronaldo’s trip to the White House comes as Trump plans to welcome the Saudi prince with all the trappings of a state visit, including a welcome ceremony and formal dinner.\n \n\n   \n  The visit cannot be classified as an official state visit, however, as Prince bin Salman is not Saudi Arabia’s head of state. It will include a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office and lunch.\n \n\n   \n  This is the crown prince’s first trip to the White House in more than seven years and the first since the 2018 murder of dissident journalist  Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate  in Turkey. A CIA assessment released afterward found the prince had likely ordered the assassination, though he has long denied any involvement.\n \n\n   \n  The occasion also appears to be a rare visit to the US for Ronaldo. He last played in the US in  August 2014 , when he played for European giant Real Madrid against another of his former clubs, Manchester United, on a summer preseason tour in Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  Ronaldo has previously faced  legal troubles  in the US over allegations that he raped a woman in Las Vegas in 2009. Ronaldo has always vehemently denied the allegations and said the encounter was consensual. Charges were never brought by local authorities, and a civil case against the Portuguese star was dismissed in 2022 due to “misconduct” by the plaintiff’s attorney. Since then, Ronaldo has appeared to make no public appearances in the US.\n \n\n   \n    2026 World Cup to be Ronaldo’s last\n \n\n   \n  Ronaldo recently told CNN that the 2026 FIFA World Cup will “definitely” be his last.\n \n\n   \n  “I will be 41 years old, and I think (this) will be the moment in the big competition,” the five-time UEFA Champions League winner told  CNN’s Becky Anderson in an interview  at the Tourise Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, last week.\n \n\n   \n  The superstar also confessed to CNN that he will likely hang up his cleats on his legendary career soon: “Let’s be honest, when I mean soon, it’s probably one or two years I’ll still be (in) the game.”\n \n\n   \n  The expanded 48-team World Cup, the largest in history, kicks off on June 11, 2026, and is being co-hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada.\n \n\n   \n  The  World Cup draw  is scheduled for December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:59 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When the FBI director came back from Asia touting a major win for the administration’s drug crackdown last week, his victory lap was cut short by yet another development in  the Jeffrey Epstein saga. \n \n\n   \n  When Patel took the podium in the White House press briefing room Wednesday, the news of the administration’s efforts to stem fentanyl production — a major priority for the president — took a backseat to headlines about the latest dump of documents by the House Oversight Committee.\n \n\n   \n  For Patel and other FBI and Justice officials, the first 10 months in office have featured a series of headaches, with theories once peddled by the president’s loyal supporters-turned-government officials getting in the way of their new priorities.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI declined to comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n    The Epstein files\n \n\n   \n  In a 2023 podcast interview, conservative commentator Benny Johnson asked Patel why the so-called Epstein “list” had not been released.\n \n\n   \n  “Simple, because of who’s on that list,” Patel responded, adding that Republicans should “put on your big boy pants and let us know who the pedophiles are.”\n \n\n   \n  While the existence of an actual list of powerful people accused of participating in Epstein’s sex ring has never been verified — the Justice Department does hold records related to the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  In the early weeks of the current administration, Attorney General Pam Bondi orchestrated a White House event ostensibly to fulfill President Donald Trump’s transparency promises and to release the Epstein files. But the event backfired when MAGA influencers invited to the White House realized the binders Bondi presented were filled mostly with documents that had long been public.\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, Bondi, Patel, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, and other Trump administration officials have sought to close the books on Epstein — only to be confronted by the reality that the conspiracies they fueled won’t allow them to. Justice Department and FBI officials have grown frustrated that the Epstein debacle has continued to obscure other priorities.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the pressure has come from influential conservatives on social media and pro-Trump members of Congress. Trump appeared to cave to that pressure late Sunday when, after days of lashing out at Democrats who he blames for the Epstein scandal, he reversed course and told Republicans to vote for the  release of the Epstein files. \n \n\n   \n  The latest twists in the administration’s Epstein problem came after Congressional democrats  released emails   from Epstein, the convicted sex abuser. The release reignited the Justice Department’s battle to tamp down claims that powerful people were trying to keep damaging information about those in Epstein’s inner circle from being released.\n \n\n   \n  The emails, which were provided under subpoena to Congress by the Epstein estate, showed that Epstein mentioned Trump by name multiple times in his private correspondence. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the White House cast the issue as a “hoax.”\n \n\n   \n  After a day of scrutiny, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche  said on X  of the emails that law enforcement “didn’t have” those emails previously and said the estate “hid” them for years. Bongino, who has also pushed unproven Epstein theories before joining the bureau, reposted it on his personal account.\n \n\n   \n  The claim prompted an attorney for the Epstein estate to dispute that anything had been “hidden” from investigators. The back-and-forth made clear that the trove of documents in the Justice Department’s possession didn’t include records now being sent to Congress, a problem for Blanche and Justice officials who have sought to assure the public that they had reviewed everything and decided there was no additional evidence of wrongdoing to be investigated.\n \n\n   \n  Justice officials’ monthslong effort to move on from the Epstein debacle had been wiped out, and Trump publicly called on Bondi to  investigate Epstein’s ties  to high-profile Democratic figures.\n \n\n   \n  That investigation is now underway,  Bondi has said , months after DOJ and FBI officials concluded that there were  no additional prosecutions  that could be brought based on their comprehensive review of the Epstein investigation.\n \n\n   \n  As director, Patel has told Congress the FBI went through all investigative materials related to Epstein and found no evidence of a grand conspiracy of Epstein trafficking women to the wealthy and elite despite his previous support of the idea.\n \n\n   \n  Patel wasn’t alone in fanning the Epstein flames. Bongino, on his own  podcast,  lamented in May 2024: “What the hell are they hiding with Jeffrey Epstein?”\n \n\n   \n  “What do Clinton, Obama officials, big money leftists, a former prime minister of Israel — why do they want to make this Jeffrey Epstein story go away so bad?” Bongino asked.\n \n\n   \n  The contrast is sharp between then and more recent times.\n \n\n   \n  Bongino told Fox News host Sean Hannity in June his views had evolved and acknowledged being frustrated at the backlash from right-wing media.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not paid for my opinions anymore,” he said. “I work for the taxpayer. I’m paid [based] on evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  That same month, Patel told podcaster Joe Rogan about the Epstein files “We’re not gonna re-victimize women. We’re not going to put that shit back out there. It’s not happening, because he wins … You want to hate me for it, fine.”\n \n\n   \n    Pipe bomber identity \n \n\n   \n  The Epstein case, while consuming the most oxygen online and in the media, is not the only conspiracy-laden storyline that has been resurrected to the annoyance of Justice Department officials.\n \n\n   \n  For years, some figures in right-wing media have fixated on theories that the January 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol was an “inside job.” One of the biggest mysteries of that day remains who planted crude bombs near the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee offices. The devices were discovered around the time of the riot and, for a time, diverted police away from what was unfolding at the Capitol, fueling additional suspicions of possible coordination.\n \n\n   \n  Federal agents have followed thousands of leads in their pursuit of the would-be bomber, who was clad in a hoodie and facemask, but they have so far come up  empty handed .\n \n\n   \n  Weeks before he took his post as second-in-command of the agency,  Bongino suggested  that evidence was being buried because the FBI was somehow involved. “Folks, this guy was an insider,” he said on his podcast. “This was an inside job. And it is the biggest scandal in FBI history.”\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, The Blaze, a right-wing media outlet, published an article that named a former Capitol Police officer as the suspect based on video analysis comparing the way the officer walked to the stride of the alleged bomber.\n \n\n   \n  Soon, the FBI and Bongino himself were forced to defend the agency from the same type of allegations the deputy director had once made – including one post from Republican Rep. Thomas Massie that seemed to draw particular ire from Bongino.\n \n\n   \n  Massie  posted a letter  from a self-proclaimed FBI whistleblower that alleged FBI leadership was trying to bury information on the pipe bomber’s identity.\n \n\n   \n  “This is disgusting, even by the low standards many have for politicians,” Bongino said in a  lengthy X post  addressed to Massie. “You know my number, and you’re free to call me anytime. But it’s easier to tweet and throw BS bombs.”\n \n\n   \n  He continued, “a week of near 24-hour work on RECENT open-source leads in the case has yet to produce a breakthrough, and some of the media reporting regarding prior persons of interest is grossly inaccurate and serves only to mislead the public.”\n \n\n   \n  Former FBI agents and officials who once supported Patel and Bongino and welcomed the ushering of a new age at the agency have now turned their backs on the pair, including over the pipe bomb investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “You can actually hear the shovel hitting the bullshit, right? Is it just me?” former FBI agent and right-wing podcast host Kyle Seraphin posted on X Sunday following Patel’s claims on Fox News that the FBI was thoroughly investigating the pipe bombs.\n \n\n   \n    FBI Rapid Response\n \n\n   \n  As officials try to dodge conspiratorial distractions from some of their own erstwhile supporters, the FBI created a new social media account on Wednesday called the “FBI Rapid Response.”\n \n\n   \n  The stated goal of the account: Combating “lies, smears and falsehoods from the fake news and others seeking to undermine our work and national security.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI began working to establish the account months before the recent Epstein backlash, though it took some time to get the proper legal approvals through the government bureaucracy, a person briefed on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The account’s second post defended the FBI against claims it had lied, this time from right-wing media star Tucker Carlson, who claimed the FBI had lied about Donald Trump’s would-be assassins’ online presence.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024, Thomas Crooks opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, injuring Trump’s ear, killing one rally-goer and injuring others.\n \n\n   \n  “This FBI has never said Thomas Crooks had no online footprint. Ever,” the FBI  posted  about the man who shot Trump at a rally last summer and killed an attendee.\n \n\n   \n  The director himself sent out a lengthy post on social media touting the extensive investigation the FBI conducted on Crooks, defending the agency seemingly against Carlson’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  “The investigation, conducted by over 480 FBI employees, revealed Crooks had limited online and in person interactions, planned and conducted the attack alone, and did not leak or share his intent to engage in the attack with anyone,” Patel wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Bongino, in an interview alongside Patel, told Fox News in May that there was no “big, explosive ‘there’ there.”\n \n\n   \n  “If it was there, we would have told you,” Bongino said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Deep state’ mockery\n \n\n   \n  Patel, who, during Joe Biden’s presidency, published books and made scores of podcast and media appearances lamenting the “deep state” of the government and FBI now praises the work of the agency, saying he has allowed “good cops to be cops.”\n \n\n   \n  This consistent praise, however, has not stopped internal mockery of the director who, in his nine months on the job, has overseen a spate of firings in the agency against perceived political enemies. One of those fired included former acting director of the FBI, Brian Driscoll, who shielded agents that worked on January 6 cases from political retribution by the Trump administration earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, FBI agents have been sharing with each other an  AI generated music video  that pokes fun at Patel for “hiding all the Epstein files,” among other public missteps by the director, sources inside the agency told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Some FBI employees have been taken back by Patel’s use of an FBI aircraft to fly to sporting events and to visit his girlfriend, according to sources. A spokesperson for Patel said he has complied with the law requiring him to pay the cost of a regular plane ticket for his flights.\n \n\n   \n  In the video, the music plays as a computer-generated Patel dressed in a leather jumpsuit dances under colorful lights in an FBI office. He also flies on the bureau’s private jet with his girlfriend, shoves heaps of caviar into his mouth and punches a hole in a school locker.\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t be mad at how I downsize, had to snuff out some liberal spies. Now my caviar is always supplied and all my people pray that I’m fired,” the song goes.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/aca-subsidies-trump-obamacare-gop","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:14:00-05:00","title":"Republicans Are Racing to Find a Plan for Enhanced ACA Subsidies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"With the enhanced Affordable Care Act premium subsidies set to expire in less than six weeks, Republicans are scrambling to find a compromise solution.

find a plan for enhanced ACA subsidies. Here’s what they’re considering \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:14 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With less than six weeks before a key set of Affordable Care Act premium subsidies expire, congressional Republicans are  scrambling  to come up with a plan to address the pain of health care premiums skyrocketing for roughly 22 million Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Health care has long been a thorny issue for Republicans, and this time is no different. The caucus is divided, with some more moderate — and vulnerable — GOP lawmakers looking to temporarily extend the enhanced Obamacare subsidies with several changes. But others are following  President Donald Trump’s push  to send federal assistance directly to consumers, rather than health insurers.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the pressure is the looming mid-December vote in the Senate on extending the enhanced subsidies, which was a concession the several Democrats wrangled from GOP leaders in exchange for agreeing to end the record-long  federal government shutdown . However, it’s questionable if any plan — from either party — can win enough support to pass, and it’s not feasible to enact more substantive changes to the ACA subsidy structure before 2026 coverage begins.\n \n\n   \n  Enacted by the Biden administration in 2021, the  enhanced premium subsidies  made Obamacare policies more affordable — particularly for low-income consumers, who could find plans with $0 or near $0 monthly charges, and for the middle class, who became eligible for assistance for the first time. The beefed-up subsidies helped draw a  record 24 million people  to sign up for coverage this year, double the number that enrolled in 2020. And more than 90% of them receive premium assistance.\n \n\n   \n  If the enhanced subsidies lapse as scheduled, premiums are expected to soar 114%, on average, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. A 60-year-old couple making $85,000 could have to pay $20,000 more annually for coverage. Roughly 2 million fewer people will be insured next year if the more generous assistance lapses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Extending the enhanced subsidies would cost about $350 billion over the next decade\n \n\n   \n    Giving money to consumers\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Trump pushed the idea of sending subsidies directly to consumers, rather than to insurers, as is now the case in the Affordable Care Act. The president doubled down on the effort on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “THE ONLY HEALTHCARE I WILL SUPPORT OR APPROVE IS SENDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE, WITH NOTHING GOING TO THE BIG, FAT, RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHO HAVE MADE $TRILLIONS, AND RIPPED OFF AMERICA LONG ENOUGH,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “THE PEOPLE WILL BE ALLOWED TO NEGOTIATE AND BUY THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, INSURANCE. POWER TO THE PEOPLE.”\n \n\n   \n  At least two senators have jumped on Trump’s declaration, sketching out different ways of shifting federal funds to consumers.\n \n\n   \n  Giving Americans more control over their health care spending is a longtime goal of many Republicans, said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+ and former health policy director for Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. GOP lawmakers have long advocated for greater use of health savings accounts, or HSAs, which allow people to sock away money that can be used to pay for medical expenses tax free — though the funds typically can’t be used to pay for health insurance premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida is working on a bill that will give Americans funds “in HSA-style accounts and let them buy the health care they want. This will increase competition & drive down costs,” he  posted on X  in response to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Scott has not provided many details on his legislation but  told Fox News  on Sunday that people could use the funds to pay for premiums or co-pays. His proposal doesn’t seek to repeal Obamacare, but to fix it, he said.\n \n\n   \n  However, ideas like Trump’s and Scott’s could rock the Affordable Care Act and, potentially, lead to its withering or demise, experts say. That’s because people with fewer health care needs would likely use the funds to buy less comprehensive, less expensive coverage, leaving sicker, costlier enrollees in Obamacare policies and prompting insurers to raise premiums.\n \n\n   \n  “This would in a big way pull healthy people out of the ACA risk pool and likely lead to a premium death spiral and collapse of the ACA marketplaces,” said Larry Levitt, KFF’s executive vice president for health policy.\n \n\n   \n  An alternate plan promoted by GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana would direct the funds that would have been spent on the enhanced subsidies into flexible spending accounts that policyholders could use to shop for health care, which he argues would give patients incentives to find better prices. Cassidy is also open to the use of HSAs since the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill broadened eligibility to more ACA enrollees, a spokesman for the senator told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “We empower patients to shop to find the best deal for their dollar that drives competition and that lowers cost,” Cassidy said in a speech on the Senate floor last week.\n \n\n   \n  Cassidy, who said on CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday that he is in communication with the White House about his plan, would retain the original Affordable Care Act subsidies, which were part of the 2010 health reform law and are not expiring.\n \n\n   \n  However, the complex US health care system is not designed for patients to shop for services, despite attempts by the first Trump administration to increase price transparency, experts said. It can be difficult for insured patients to know how much they would be responsible for when taking into account negotiated rates, deductibles and co-insurance. Plus, most spending is driven by sick patients who already have relationships with providers, and consolidation in the industry has decreased competition.\n \n\n   \n  “In theory, it seems like a good idea,” said Mona Shah, senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, which advocates for equitable health care. “The reality is even if that [price] information is accessible, how many people could navigate that, understand the differences, have the time to do that and then make informed decisions?”\n \n\n   \n  Also, giving consumers more control over the funds could actually put upward pressure on health care prices since they’ll have more money to spend on services, said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n \n\n   \n    Extending the subsidies\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, there are efforts on Capitol Hill to extend the enhanced subsidies, which are formally known as premium tax credits, though some GOP lawmakers are advocating changes to the assistance.\n \n\n   \n  A bipartisan group of 30 House members  wrote a letter  Monday to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, urging them to include House lawmakers in the health reform discussions. Among the authors was Virginia Rep. Jen Kiggans, a Republican, who wants to extend the enhanced subsidies for a year to give Congress time to come up with an alternate plan.\n \n\n   \n  “As you know, those who rely on the expiring Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits (ePTCs) are facing drastic premium increases,” the representatives wrote. “Allowing these tax credits to lapse without a clear path forward would risk real harm to those we represent.”\n \n\n   \n  Another bipartisan House proposal calls for extending the enhanced subsidies for two years but placing an income cap on beefed-up assistance, phasing it out for those who make between $200,000 and $400,000 annually.\n \n\n   \n  Neither party wants “to see premiums skyrocket, and they will if these [enhanced subsidies] expire with nothing in its place,” GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, a member of the House Problem Solvers Caucus who supports the effort, told CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday. “It can’t just be a Republican plan if we want to pass something. So we got to sit down with Democrats and figure out what can we do.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/entertainment/kessler-twins-die-assisted-suicide-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"09:57:00-05:00","title":"Entertainment duo the Kessler twins die by assisted suicide, aged 89","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Kessler twins, Alice and Ellen Kessler, two German entertainers who rose to fame in the 1950s as showgirls and performers, died at age 89 by joint assisted suicide in Gruenwald, Munich.

\n  Alice and Ellen Kessler, the German  twins  who rose to fame in the 1950s as a variety entertainment duo, have died at the age of 89 by joint assisted suicide, advocacy organization the German Society for Humane Dying (DGHS)   said on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Local police confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that “there was a deployment yesterday lunchtime in Gruenwald” – the leafy suburb of Munich where the twins lived – but did not say the reason for that deployment.\n \n\n   \n  The twins contacted the DGHS, which provides access to lawyers and doctors, more than a year ago and became members, the organization told CNN on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “The decisive factor is likely to have been the desire to die together on a specific date,” DGHS spokesperson Wega Wetzel told CNN, adding that she wasn’t aware of the precise reasons given by each woman.\n \n\n   \n  “Their desire to die was well-considered, long-standing, and free from any psychiatric crisis,” Wetzel said.\n \n\n   \n  During an  interview  with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera last year, the twins said they wanted “to go away together on the same day.” “The idea that one of us might get it first is very hard to bear,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  They wished to have their ashes interred in the same urn too, alongside their mother Elsa and dog Yello, Ellen Kessler told German tabloid Bild last year.\n \n\n   \n  Assisted dying, under certain circumstances, is legal in Germany after the country’s top court ruled in 2020 that an individual has the right to end their life and to seek help from a third party if they aren’t subject to external influences.\n \n\n   \n  With their blonde, coiffed hair, long legs and talent for both singing and dancing, the Kessler twins embodied the aesthetic of the 1950s and 60s showgirl.\n \n\n   \n  As children, they attended classical ballet school before fleeing East Germany in 1952 to pursue dance. Shortly after, the twins began their careers at the Lido in Paris, a venue known for its cabaret performances, but they quickly transcended that world.\n \n\n   \n  They represented Germany at the 1959 Eurovision Song Contest, appeared several times on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” once featured on the cover of Life magazine, and moved in circles populated by the biggest stars of that era like Fred Astaire, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and Rock Hudson.\n \n\n   \n  “The Ed Sullivan Show” posted a  tribute  to the Kessler twins on social media, remembering them as “dazzling stars, true legends, and sisters whose grace, charm, and magic will shine forever.”\n \n\n   \n    Fame in Italy\n \n\n   \n  The sisters soon became stars in Italy too. They made history as the first showgirls to appear on Italian television and the first female stars to show their legs on screen, according to Eurovision. However, they had to wear opaque tights due to the strict Christian conservative values of the time, state broadcaster RAI said. Nevertheless, their legs were dubbed “the legs of the country.”\n \n\n   \n  And when they posed naked for the Italian edition of Playboy in 1976, it sold out in three hours, according to Eurovision’s website.\n \n\n   \n  They appeared in Italian movies and in theater, achieving such widespread fame there that state broadcaster RAI released a detailed plan on Tuesday of the ways in which it would cover their deaths, both on the news and by rerunning old television shows starring them.\n \n\n   \n  The sisters’ entertainment careers continued long after the era of the showgirl had waned. As well as making guest appearances on German television, they starred in a musical that played in Berlin, Munich and Vienna from 2015 to 2016.\n \n\n   \n  Their lives were intertwined beyond just their shared career. They lived in “two mirrored, connecting apartments,” the sisters told Corriere della Sera last year, and would meet every day at noon for lunch.\n \n\n   \n  The twins were born in a village that today belongs to Grimma, a town in Saxony.\n \n\n   \n  Tino Kießig, the mayor of Grimma, said in a statement Monday that the town “mourns the loss of these two world-renowned personalities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/lawsuit-air-ambulance-crash","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-05:00","title":"Lawsuit Filed Over 2 Deaths in January Air Ambulance Crash in Philadelphia","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The families of two victims, pediatrician Dr. Raul Meza Arredondo and mother Lizeth Murillo Osuna, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in early November 2025, alleging that Med Jets (operating as Jet Rescue) negligently caused the deaths of eight people in a January 31, 2025 air ambulance crash near Roosevelt Mall in Philadelphia.

November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Flight delays and the recent government shutdown are pushing more travelers onto US highways this Thanksgiving, raising the risk of wrecks on what is already one of the most dangerous travel periods of the year, data shows.\n \n\n   \n  The crash rate on the Sunday after Thanksgiving is 65% higher compared with the previous Sunday, based on 2024 data analyzed by Samsara, a technology company that tracks commercial fleet safety.\n \n\n   \n  Kelly Soderlund, head of insights at Samsara told CNN, this year could be even more dangerous because of the surge in drivers.\n \n\n   \n   The American Automobile Association  projects nearly 82 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles from home over the holiday period, which runs from Tuesday, November 25, through Monday, December 1.\n \n\n   \n  That is an increase of about 1.6 million from last year. The association said the number could rise further if travelers switch from flying to driving after recent flight cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of people needed to make their plans during a time when the government was shut down and air travel was having a rough go,” Soderlund said. “We knew there was going to be more people on the road.”\n \n\n   \n    Why the Sunday after Thanksgiving is especially risky\n \n\n   \n  In its study “America’s Most Dangerous Winter Roads,” released Tuesday, Samsara analyzed data from 2022 through 2025. The results show a consistent pattern: crash risk rises in winter regardless of fleet size or industry.\n \n\n   \n  Thanksgiving itself is usually safer, Soderlund said, because many people are off the road visiting family. The higher crash risk comes during transitional travel periods, especially the Sunday after the holiday. This year it falls on November 30.\n \n\n   \n  Samsara found the spike is driven by heavy congestion, long-distance travel and driver fatigue. Millions of Americans are returning home, creating one of the busiest travel windows of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not only regular consumers heading back on the road but also delivery drivers and commercial trucks,” Soderlund said. During Thanksgiving week, many shippers scale back operations, reducing the number of trucks on the road. But the Sunday after, fleets ramp up again, coinciding with the busiest travel day of the year.\n \n\n   \n  Winter conditions also increase risk. Early winter weather, including rain and snow, is already appearing in several regions. “If it’s not winter yet, you may be getting rain or early snow, which can make roads slick and reduce visibility,” Soderlund said.\n \n\n   \n  Certain roads and regions carry higher risks, including I-80 across the country, the New Jersey Turnpike and northern states such as North Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming and Iowa, where snow and icy conditions can appear early.\n \n\n   \n    Tips for staying safe\n \n\n   \n  Drivers can reduce risk by leaving earlier in the day, avoiding night travel and keeping extra space around large trucks.\n \n\n   \n  About half of all winter crashes occur between noon and 8 p.m., when visibility drops and fatigue peaks, Soderlund said. Afternoon and evening travel can also be dangerous because of congestion and delivery traffic.\n \n\n   \n  “Be aware of blind spots,” Soderlund said. “Don’t assume commercial vehicles can see you and give them plenty of room. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/maga-movement-trump-epstein-division","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:27:00.000Z","title":"The key issues that are suddenly dividing MAGA","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes how Donald Trump’s declining political influence is exposing deep divisions within the MAGA coalition.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:27 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of  President Donald Trump’s  great talents as a politician has been in holding together a very disparate coalition. His supporters might not have agreed on everything, but they did agree on Trump. And that’s what mattered.\n \n\n   \n  But as the party begins to turn to its post-Trump realities — and as the great MAGA unifying force that is Trump appears politically diminished — those divisions are starting to come to the fore.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, with the president soon becoming a lame duck who can’t run again, there seems to be a rush to define what a post-Trump GOP will look like.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most striking was  Trump’s capitulation  over the weekend on releasing the Epstein files. But that’s not the only issue on which the president’s coalition appears to be dividing and many in Trump’s base appear to be on a different page.\n \n\n   \n  These tensions have existed for a while. But what seems to be shifting is that they’re now breaking out in the open.\n \n\n   \n  Below is a look at some of the big issues where we’re seeing this.\n \n\n   \n    The Epstein files\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s problems here appear to be more of a slow burn of MAGA disillusionment, rather than a harsh backlash.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have routinely showed less than a majority of Republicans approve of Trump’s and his administration’s handling of the matter. In a late-September  NPR-PBS News-Marist College poll , the number was just 45% of Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean a majority  disapprove ; only around one-quarter do, while the rest withhold judgment. But it’s pretty stunning to see Trump get less than majority support from his own party on any issue. Indeed, even after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, a  majority of Republicans stood by Trump’s handling of  the response to it.\n \n\n   \n  Majorities of Republicans have also said they believe the government has hidden information about Epstein’s death and alleged clients and that powerful people are implicated in his crimes. Given that, it stands to reason that they wouldn’t like Trump standing in the way of full transparency. The president indicated on Monday he’d sign legislation to release the Justice Department files if it reaches his desk.\n \n\n   \n    Tucker Carlson/Nick Fuentes/antisemitism/Charlie Kirk conspiracy theories\n \n\n   \n  All of these elements are interwoven. They basically boil down to internal MAGA divisions over whether to police other elements of the movement – including when they promote racist and antisemitic views.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders and many prominent influencers have been reluctant to do that for fear of alienating would-be supporters and taking the focus off the left.  Vice President JD Vance  and Megyn Kelly were early proponents of a “no enemies on the right” posture.\n \n\n   \n  But some, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, have since argued that antisemitism has so infected the conservative movement  that it’s dangerous to ignore it . There’s also growing alarm over Candace Owens  baselessly connecting  Israel to Charlie Kirk’s assassination on her immensely popular podcast. The theory appears to have gained real traction amid some corners on the right.\n \n\n   \n  Passionate and sometimes angry debates have ensued. This most recently  blew up over the Heritage Foundation’s  initial decision to stand by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson after his friendly interview with Nick Fuentes, a White nationalist and Holocaust denier. Prominent people continue to leave the organization.\n \n\n   \n    Tariffs and affordability\n \n\n   \n  This is another one of those slow-burn problems for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The MAGA base has been  willing to entertain Trump’s tariffs  and even willing to believe they’ll eventually turn out to be for the best — despite them running contrary to decades of GOP free-trade evangelism. But there are also signs of declining patience.\n \n\n   \n  A recent  Washington Post-ABC News poll  showed 25% of Republicans disapproved of Trump’s handling of tariffs, and nearly half (47%) said the tariffs would make inflation worse.\n \n\n   \n  Other recent polls have shown a majority of Republicans say the Trump administration  isn’t focusing enough on lowering prices , and just 65% say Trump’s policies have improved economic conditions in the country, according to  a recent CNN poll .\n \n\n   \n  The tariffs and prices at home were some of the first issues on which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia  broke with Trump .\n \n\n   \n    H1-B visas\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s recent interview with Laura Ingraham was unusually contentious for a Fox News interview.\n \n\n   \n  While talking about the  H1-B skilled worker visa program , Ingraham posited that the US didn’t need to import so many workers because “we have plenty of talented people here.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump replied rather brusquely: “ No, you don’t, no you don’t  … you don’t have certain talents, and people have to learn.”\n \n\n   \n  The answer rekindled  an old MAGA backlash , which first reared its head when Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy defended the need for H1-B visas after the 2024 election. A number of MAGA influencers  publicly criticized Trump  last week. Actor Kevin Sorbo declared that the answer would “cost republicans the midterms.”\n \n\n   \n  A Quinnipiac University poll in January showed  28% of Republicans opposed the H1-B program  outright.\n \n\n   \n    The ballroom/self-enrichment issues\n \n\n   \n  Trump has taken remarkably little care to guard against the perception that he’s bathing in luxury even as Americans are struggling. He’s also taken remarkably little care to guard against  apparent conflicts of interest  and intermingling of personal business with his presidential duties.\n \n\n   \n  And there are signs that it’s wearing even on some of his supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most striking was Trump’s decision last month to bulldoze the East Wing of the White House and start building a $350 million ballroom during the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  A poll showed only a slight majority of Republicans approved of the project, and  about one-quarter disapproved .\n \n\n   \n  Relatedly, Trump’s personal businesses have pressed forward with lucrative development and cryptocurrency deals that often overlap with his official business. Most recently, the Trump Organization this week announced  a project in the Maldives  with its Saudi-linked development partners, on the eve of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has said it extensively studies any potential conflicts of interest. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in May that it was “frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit.”\n \n\n   \n  A recent  Pew Research Center poll  showed about 3 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents agreed that Trump was probably improperly using his office to enrich himself or his friends and family.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s foreign focus\n \n\n   \n  Steve Bannon recently flagged an emerging MAGA sentiment that Trump might be too focused on foreign matters — as opposed to “America First.”\n \n\n   \n  Or, as Bannon put it  to Axios , Trump is spending “too much time on Palestine and not enough on East Palestine,” Ohio.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Trump is throwing  a lavish welcome  for the Saudi crown prince. Last week he hosted the Syrian president. Perhaps most striking was the  tens of billions of dollars  Trump recently pledged to help Argentina and  prop up a political ally  in its president, Javier Milei. We don’t have good polling on that, but it’s logical to assume that such a foreign bailout might be a problem with some in the “America First” crowd.\n \n\n   \n  Many Republicans are skeptical of Trump’s  threats to attack Venezuela  and other recent maneuvers in South America. A recent  Reuters-Ipsos poll  showed 39% of Republicans supported using military force to remove Nicolas Maduro, while 29% opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  Another  27% opposed  Trump using the military to kill suspected drug-traffickers without due process, as he has with his boat strikes in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, the GOP base seemed  somewhat skeptical  of Trump’s strikes on Iran in June, with just 44% “strongly” supporting them in a CNN poll. And even the ceasefire the president  brokered in Gaza hasn’t done much for Trump’s numbers.\n \n\n   \n  A  Reuters-Ipsos poll  in June showed 52% of Republicans said it was “better for the nation if the US stays out of the affairs of other nations.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/world/hong-kong-crash-preliminary-report","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"08:49:00-05:00","title":"Engine accelerated after landing, a probe into deadly Hong Kong plane crash finds","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A preliminary investigation into a deadly cargo plane crash in Hong Kong on October 20, 2025, found that the aircraft’s Number 4 engine accelerated after landing, despite the other three engines being in reverse thrust.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dozens of  Israeli  settlers launched an arson attack on an agricultural area in the occupied West Bank Tuesday evening, according to Palestinian activists in the area, marking the latest such attack in what has been a surge of  settler violence .\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in the town of Beit Lid east of Tulkarm, damaging the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory, videos show and residents told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN shows smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women heard shouting in the background, and men carrying extinguishers and water buckets scrambling to put out the fires.\n \n\n   \n  Videos show torched trucks, tents and metal sheds, and smashed car windows.\n \n\n   \n  Residents said Palestinian civil defense and firefighters arrived at the scene about an hour after the fires started.\n \n\n   \n  Another video filmed by a Palestinian resident shows the settlers coming down a hill toward the Bedouin village.\n \n\n   \n  This attack is the latest in a surge of settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, which have been taking place on a near-daily basis since mid-October. A United Nations report released Friday alleges that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the  largest number  since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006, with this year’s olive harvest season marred by extreme violence.\n \n\n   \n  CCTV footage of the arson attack obtained by CNN then shows the settlers attacking the dairy factory, brandishing clubs and setting fire to parked vehicles. One of the vehicles – a cargo truck bearing the dairy factory’s logo – appears to be completely torched, with a thick cloud of black smoke rising from it.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian economy ministry on Wednesday called on the international community to take action to stop the attacks.

Gen. Avi Bluth said in a statement shared by the IDF on Wednesday. “It must be dealt with firmly.”\n \n\n   \n  He continued it was unacceptable for “lawbreakers” to “harm property and innocent civilians” while diverting the IDF’s focus “away from its mission of security and counterterrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  Gilad Kariv, an Israeli lawmaker from the left-wing Democrats party, decried the settler attack  on X . “Their goal is to ignite a third intifada, that will bring the IDF to operate in a way reminiscent of the operation in Gaza. This move will cost the lives of hundreds of Israel soldiers and civilians and thousands of Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it dispatched its soldiers to the area following “a report of dozens of masked Israeli civilians who attacked Palestinians and set fire to property in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  “During the incident, four Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment. Security forces operated to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a statement. The settlers also attacked the soldiers and damaged an Israeli military vehicle, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Police said it had arrested four Israeli “suspects” and transferred them for questioning, following the “extreme violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Police investigators, together with security forces, are currently collecting evidence at the scene, including documentation, witness statements and forensic findings,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  The arson attack is the latest in what has become an increasingly violent period in the West Bank during the olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, at least 10 people were injured in an attack on the village of Beita while Palestinian farmers were harvesting olives, including three medics, four journalists and three activists, according to Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak who was present and himself injured.\n \n\n   \n  Activist Oded Yedaya, an Israeli photographer and administrator of the Minshar School of Art in Tel Aviv, had to be hospitalized after he was badly beaten, according to Pollak. Images obtained by CNN show Yedaya’s entire face and torso bloodied, with a white cloth wrapped around his head.\n \n\n   \n  Pollak told CNN Yedaya suffered fractures to the cheekbone and jaw.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF told CNN in a statement Saturday that they were aware of the incident, and had dispatched soldiers to an area around Evyatar, an Israeli outpost nearby “following a report of a confrontation between Israeli civilians and Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby village of Burin, Israeli and foreign activists were injured including off-duty Israeli army reservist Yuval Ben Ari.\n \n\n   \n  In a phone interview with CNN, Ben Ari said seeing videos of Palestinians being “brutally beaten” by settlers every day compelled him to go out and support them.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s important for Israelis to get out of bed and out of the house and do real activism instead of just liking content on Facebook or retweeting an article,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He was standing alongside seven Israeli activists on a Palestinian farm picking olives early Saturday morning, when he saw at least 20 masked settlers come down the hill brandishing clubs and bats.\n \n\n   \n  He said he knew they were about to “terrorize the entire area.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stood in front of them and said, ‘I ask you not to do it.  You don’t want to do it,’” he said, before revealing to them that he was a reservist. But that didn’t stop the attack, he said, and he suffered a head injury and minor concussion that required hospitalization.\n \n\n   \n  “I was soaking blood and in pain. But after I managed to stand up, the settlers shouted at me saying, ‘Don’t ever come here again. Don’t betray your own people.’”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a query from CNN, the IDF said in a statement that its soldiers “were dispatched to the area of Burin, following a report of rock-hurling at an Israeli vehicle.”\n \n\n   \n  “Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured and evacuated to receive medical treatment…The IDF condemns any act of violence and will continue to operate to maintain security and order in the area.” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Ari told CNN the soldiers who arrived at the scene did not stop the attack, an accusation many Palestinians and activists have voiced in other incidents as well.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"09:35:00-05:00","title":"A new virus variant and lagging vaccinations may mean the US is in for a severe flu season","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is facing a potentially severe flu season due to the emergence of a new H3N2 flu variant, subclade K, which has caused early surges in the UK, Canada, and Japan.

variant and lagging vaccinations may mean the US is in for a severe flu season \n       \n  By Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:35 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United States may be heading into its second severe flu season in a row, driven by a mutated strain called subclade K that’s behind early surges in the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Last winter’s season was extreme, too.   The US had  its highest rates  of flu hospitalizations in nearly 15 years. At least  280 children died of influenza , the highest number since pediatric death numbers were required to be shared in 2004.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with a new variant in the mix, experts say we’re on track for a repeat. And with flu vaccinations down and holiday travel on the way, they worry that things may look much worse in the weeks ahead.\n \n\n   \n  The good news: Early analysis shows that this season’s flu shots offer some protection against being hospitalized with this variant, especially for kids. The bad news is that many Americans appear to be skipping their flu vaccines this year. New data from prescription data company IQVIA shows that vaccinations are down compared to where they usually are at this point in the year.\n \n\n   \n    A new player\n \n\n   \n  Flu activity is low but rising quickly in the United States, according to the  latest FluView report  from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the flu viruses identified this season have been an A strain called H3N2, and half of those have come from subclade K, a variant that was responsible for a rougher-than-normal flu season this summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\n \n\n   \n  That variant wasn’t a major player when scientists decided which strains should be in the annual flu shots, so the vaccines cover a related but slightly different group of viruses.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like we’re expecting to get complete loss of protection for the vaccine, but perhaps we might expect a little bit of a drop-off if this is the virus that sort of dominates the season, and early indications are that’s probably going to be the case,” said Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for studies on the ecology of influenza in animals and birds at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n \n\n   \n  Early analysis by the UK Health Security Agency shows that subclade K has seven gene changes on a key segment of the virus. Those mutations change the shape of this region, making it harder for the body’s defenses to recognize.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the   predominant thing that our immune system targets with antibodies, and that’s also pretty much what’s in the vaccine,” said Dr. Adam Lauring, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Michigan Medical School.\n \n\n   \n  UKHSA scientists found that the current flu vaccines are still providing decent protection against subclade K viruses. Vaccination cut the odds of an emergency department visit or hospitalization   for the flu by almost 75% in children. The effectiveness for adults, even those over 65, was lower, about 30% to 40% against needing to visit the hospital or ER.\n \n\n   \n  But the scientists offer a caveat: These results are from early in the season, before the protection from seasonal flu vaccines has had time to wane or wear off. The findings are posted in a  recent preprint study , which means it was published ahead of scrutiny from outside experts.\n \n\n   \n  Still, some protection is better than no protection, and while subclade K is expected to dominate the season, it won’t be the only flu strain circulating. No one gets to pick what they’re exposed to. Lauring said his daughter has just recovered from the flu, but it was a B-type strain.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time this new variant has emerged, flu vaccinations appear to be down in the US. According to IQVIA, about 64% of all flu vaccinations were administered at retail pharmacies, which administered roughly 26.5 million flu shots between   August and the end of October. That’s more than 2 million fewer shots than the 28.7 million given over the same time frame in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not surprised,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, who directs the Pandemic Center at Brown University’s School of Public Health. Vaccine skepticism expressed by leaders of the US Department of Health and Human Services has “injected chaos into the whole vaccination system,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s been a lot of attention on really non-issues,” like vaccine ingredients and separating shots, that “I think, at the best, left people confused but possibly at the worst have left people worried about getting vaccinated,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Flu vaccinations  have also fallen  in Australia, where subclade K was the predominant virus   this year. As a result, flu hit a record, with  more than 443,000 cases . Flu season in the Southern Hemisphere typically runs from May to July, so infectious disease experts often look to those countries for a preview of what might be on the way to North America.\n \n\n   \n  “What they saw in Australia is that they had a bad season. And so it’s concerning for you and us, what’s coming,” said Dr. Earl Rubin, director of the infectious disease division at the Montreal Children’s Hospital in Canada.\n \n\n   \n    ‘This is the time we start to see the rise’\n \n\n   \n  It’s difficult to say whether subclade K actually makes a person sicker than other flu strains, but if it drives more cases, it will certainly drive hospitalizations too, Rubin said.\n \n\n   \n  “When you look at severity, the more cases you have, if the same percentage get hospitalized, obviously you’re going to have more hospitalization if you have more cases. So it sometimes will look like   the severity is also worse,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lab testing data has begun to show an uptick in flu cases.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the time we start to see the rise,” said Dr. Allison McMullen, a clinical microbiologist at BioMerieux, which makes the BioFire test, a popular diagnostic tool for respiratory pathogens.\n \n\n   \n  The company anonymously compiles its test results into a  syndromic surveillance tool , which can offer a glimpse of what bugs are making people sick at any given time. At the beginning of the month, less than 1% of tests were positive for type A flu. Now it’s 2.4% – still low numbers but going up briskly, which aligns with the CDC trend.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to start seeing heavy holiday travel before we know it,” McMullen added. “With the rising cases that we’re seeing the UK and Japan, it can definitely be a bellwether for what we’re going to see in North America.”\n \n\n   \n  Signals  are also rising  in wastewater, said Dr. Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University. In October, 18% of samples in the WastewaterSCAN network – an academically led wastewater monitoring program based at Stanford University, in partnership with Emory – were positive for type A flu, Wolfe said. In November, that number had risen to 40%.\n \n\n   \n  “Flu is something where, when it’s not in season, we don’t detect it very frequently in wastewater,” Wolfe said. Covid, on the other hand, can be detected pretty much all the time, which makes it challenging to know if it’s going up or down, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The scientists can set a threshold for when they can declare that a specific area is in flu season, Wolfe says. So far, just four of the 147 sites they monitor in 40 states have reached that threshold. Those sites are in the Northeast – in Maine and Vermont – in Iowa and in Hawaii.\n \n\n   \n  “I am concerned, I guess, that we could have a big flu season this year based on what we’re seeing in other parts of the world, and particularly Europe and elsewhere,” Michigan’s Lauring said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not too late. Go and get your flu shot,” Lauring advised. “And be alert that it’s out there.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/sport/sports-gambling-professional-athletes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"09:46:00-05:00","title":"Hyper-competitive people with time and money to spend: Why professional athletes love to gamble","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the deep-rooted cultural connection between professional athletes and gambling, driven by their hyper-competitive nature and disposable income.

Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With per diem money burning a hole in their pockets, they’d hop on charter flights, head to the back of the plane and  start shuffling the cards . Usually, they’d play poker, sometimes bourré but almost always some sort of card game for money.\n \n\n   \n  “And by the time the plane hit the ground,’’ chuckles one former  NBA  player who still works in the league and asked not to be identified, “your per diem would be gone. God forbid it was a 10-day trip.”\n \n\n   \n  To understand how professional athletes are getting caught in the crosshairs of illegal gambling activity, it helps to understand their culture. Theirs is a world consumed by competition and hyper-competitive people who have disposable income and time on their hands.\n \n\n   \n  “It is,’’ said an NBA scout who asked not to be identified, “a perfect storm.’’\n \n\n   \n  Many fans shook their heads when details about two alleged gambling schemes broke in recent weeks. The first  resulted in the arrest  of a current NBA coach – Chauncey Billups, a Hall of Famer – and current player Terry Rozier. Billups is accused of allegedly conspiring with noted New York crime families to rig poker games and fleece unsuspecting participants out of thousands of dollars. Rozier allegedly intentionally tipped bettors off about his game participation, allowing them to profit off of prop bets that involved him.\n \n\n   \n   The second involved Cleveland Guardians  pitchers Luis Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase. Both men are accused of allegedly working with co-conspirators to throw specific pitches in  Major League Baseball  games, coordinating with corrupt bettors to rig prop bets. The bets are alleged to have won $400,000 for bettors and Ortiz received $12,000 and Clase at least $60,000 for their roles in the scheme, according to the federal indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Why would players making hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, take part in an alleged gambling scheme that only amounted up to a fraction of their salary? Why take that risk?\n \n\n   \n  “The game fixing, the integrity of the game, that part makes no sense to me. None of it does,’’ one scout tells  CNN Sports . “And Chauncey Billups, he’s got millions. But I guess maybe he needs the action? That’s the thing. It’s kind of who they are, and now there are just so many outlets.’’\n \n\n   \n  Athletes’ hard wiring – their need to win at everything – is what makes them better than the rest of us mere mortals. Yet that same compulsion to compete, that adrenaline rush, is also what makes gambling so alluring.\n \n\n   \n  Rutgers University’s Center for Gambling Studies recently cross referenced 56 studies done on gambling and discovered that 78.9% of those studies concluded athletes gambled at higher rates than non athletes and 75% found that athletes were more likely to gamble than their non-athletic peers.\n \n\n   \n  “I can stop gambling,’’  Michael Jordan  told Connie Chung in a 1993 interview, when his own casino escapades came under scrutiny. “I have a competition problem, a competitive problem.’’\n \n\n   \n  This is not to say that all – or even most – athletes slip into the shady underworld uncovered in recent federal indictments or worse, shave points or fix games. Nor is it to excuse the behavior of those who have been accused.\n \n\n   \n  But for those who can’t comprehend how such a thing could occur, it helps to see just where the slippery slope might start.\n \n\n   \n  “These guys, they’re not going to sit around and read a f**king book,’’ the former scout said. “The game fixing? That surprises me, but the poker stuff? Not at all. You’re at a pre-game shootaround and someone says, ‘$100 I can make this shot.’ And they start at halfcourt, or three-quarters court. And they all get in.’’\n \n\n   \n    Cards and culture\n \n\n   \n  Card games have long been the pastime of the people who play America’s pastimes. Tony Kubek once told the Record of New Jersey about the 36-hour train rides he took with the New York Yankees in his MLB rookie season.\n \n\n   \n  “You talk about poker games – $100 bills on the table and this was in an era when the good players were making $25,000,” he told the paper.\n \n\n   \n  Kubek made his debut in 1957.\n \n\n   \n  More than 20 years ago, long-time friends Charles Oakley and Tyrone Hill got into a beef over a gambling debt owed by Hill to Oakley, reportedly in the tens of thousands of dollars. Frustrated that he hadn’t been paid, Oakley, then with the Raptors, leveled a ball at Hill’s head during a pre-game shootaround between Toronto and the Philadelphia 76ers. Oakley got slapped with a $10,000 fine.\n \n\n   \n  “Hey you borrow money from the bank, they charge taxes,’’ Oakley later told  GQ   about the incident. “You don’t pay the IRS, they come and get you. So I had to come get him.’’\n \n\n   \n  Oakley and Hill’s spat went public; the bad blood stemming from the seemingly innocuous games was not, however, limited to just that pair. More than a few coaches, in fact, grew tired of the infighting and stopped the games – or the ones they knew about.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t really see them so much anymore,’’ a former NBA executive told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n    ‘They drop $20,000 and think nothing of it’\n \n\n   \n  But it is impossible to stop gambling. It is, for starters, legal for people older than 21 and permissible in every state save Utah and Hawaii. Sports gambling is permissible now in 38 states. All four major professional sports – the NHL,  NFL , MLB and NBA – have strict rules on betting on their own sports but only the NFL prohibits players from gambling while on the road in team hotels and from entering a sportsbook during the season. League rules also stipulate that coaches, staff and personnel cannot bet on any sports.\n \n\n   \n  And gambling is everywhere. Of the 27 cities that sponsor NBA franchises, 17 have casinos in or near their city’s downtown.\n \n\n   \n  “You ask any security guard,’’ the scout said. “Some of these guys, they go over to the casino and they drop $20,000 and think nothing of it. Because it’s not a lot to them. It’s not about the money. It’s about winning.’’\n \n\n   \n  The NBA Summer League is held in Las Vegas where it’s not unusual, the former exec says, to see players frequent the blackjack or craps tables on the Strip.\n \n\n   \n  “And we’re not talking the $10 tables,’’ he says. “We’re talking the big-money tables.’’\n \n\n   \n  Of course, the advent of online betting means no one even needs to leave their rooms.\n \n\n   \n  “Gambling, with DraftKings and FanDuel, it’s everywhere now,’’ says former Major League outfielder Jayson Werth. “It really is part of the culture.’’\n \n\n   \n    The hook of horse racing for a retired star\n \n\n   \n  A self-described “competitive junkie’’ who had to win in backyard Wiffleball games and pickup hoops, Werth felt the void of competition hit like a gut punch when he retired in 2018. Though he is quick to point out that he cannot comprehend how any professional athlete would engage in fixing games – “To try and lose? That isn’t even in the realm of possibility. You’re trying your best to win,’’ he told CNN Sports – he does understand what it’s like to feed the need to win.\n \n\n   \n  Werth tried the post-career life of leisure, signing up for pro-am  golf  tourneys. He dabbled in quirky investments, including organic racing, but nothing quite worked. He wasn’t lost but slightly unmoored.\n \n\n   \n  And then he went down to Tampa to visit a friend, Rich Averill. The two went to Tampa Downs to watch a race involving a horse that Averill owned. Standing on the rails, a very familiar adrenaline rush coursed through Werth.\n \n\n   \n  “I was hooked,’’ he said.\n \n\n   \n  He could have done it the easy way – studied the racing form and hit the windows – but Werth realized the difference was ownership. Being all in on the horse as a financial investor meant being personally invested.\n \n\n   \n  He partnered with some friends to form  Two Eight Racing  (he wore number 28 in his pro career) and set up immersing himself in the business of horse racing. He learned about bloodstocks, researched trainers and showed up regularly at the barn to meet and greet his own horses.\n \n\n   \n  He admittedly got a little lucky – his first big horse, Dornoch, won the Belmont Stakes and his second, Flying Mohawk, made last year’s Kentucky Derby field – but he realized he didn’t need to win to feel what he needed to feel.\n \n\n   \n  That led him to branch out to form Icon Racing, a horse racing syndicate that allows partial owners to experience full-time ownership. It’s open to everyone but Werth has personally tried to lure his fellow athletes.\n \n\n   \n  “I get it,’’ he said. “We need something. I played with guys who would bet you $100 if a penny was going to land on heads or tails. You’re raised to compete your whole life so that’s what you do. You compete.\n \n\n   \n  “But when it’s gone? It’s gone. I don’t think I realized how much of an itch that was until I couldn’t scratch it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/home-depot-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Home Depot’s business is stuck.

  8:48 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  Dallas Cowboys  ensured they stayed in the  NFL  playoff hunt with a 33-16 road win against the Las Vegas Raiders on an emotional night for “America’s Team.”\n \n\n   \n  In Dallas’ first game since the  death of Marshawn Kneeland , the Cowboys – who wore shirts in memory of and bowed their heads during a moment of silence for the defensive end – snapped a two-game losing streak while showing the type of offensive play that could make them a dangerous matchup throughout the rest of the season.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have some tears when I first put the shirt on, as you can imagine,” Dallas head coach Brian Schottenheimer said. “But more than anything, I know Marshawn was looking down on us, and we wanted to make him proud, and I think we did that.”\n \n\n   \n  Behind an impressive Dak Prescott – who threw 25-of-33 for 268 yards and four touchdowns – and a stout run defense that limited the Raiders to 27 yards on the ground, the Cowboys took control in the second quarter and eased to victory.\n \n\n   \n  After a relatively slow 15 minutes that featured three field goals and ended with a 6-3 Raiders lead, Dallas quickly put Las Vegas in the rear view mirror with Prescott throwing an 18-yard touchdown pass to a wide open CeeDee Lamb nine seconds into the second quarter to cap off a six-play, 68-yard drive.\n \n\n   \n  Prescott had his second touchdown of the day almost 10 minutes later, this time throwing a short pass over the middle to Dallas tight end Jake Ferguson to make it 17-6 after the extra point.\n \n\n   \n  The Raiders were marching downfield looking to cut into the deficit with roughly 2:30 left in the half, but Geno Smith’s pass was tipped by Kenneth Murray Jr. and intercepted by Markquese Bell to take the wind out of Las Vegas’ sails.\n \n\n   \n  Prescott then capped off his extraordinary second quarter with his third touchdown of the night, this time to George Pickens, who caught the ball at the 25, spun away from Kyu Blu Kelly toward the sidelines and cut back to evade two more Raiders defenders and run it into the end zone.\n \n\n   \n  The flashy touchdown was the icing on the cake for a standout performance from Pickens, who finished the game with nine catches for 144 yards.\n \n\n   \n  Despite a Las Vegas field goal as the half ended tightening the scoreline to 24-9, Dallas stayed firmly in control in the second half with Prescott adding his fourth touchdown, this time a short pass to Ryan Flournoy with 6:19 left in the third.\n \n\n   \n  Smith threw a touchdown early in the final quarter to Tre Tucker, but the Raiders didn’t really trouble the Cowboys the rest of the night despite also tallying a safety with 11:39 remaining.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Schottenheimer said the players wanted a good showing for Kneeland: “They wanted to honor him, and we’re not done honoring him. He’s a part of our family forever.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s been tough, man. I mean, these past 11 days have been really tough. I’m proud of those guys because just the way they played today, they played with Marshawn’s play style.”\n \n\n   \n  Cowboys owner Jerry Jones added that the statement win served two purposes.\n \n\n   \n  “In a way, a competition like this with the Raiders is good therapy to come back and get in it. They know how much that Marshawn loved to compete, how much he loved the Cowboys,” he said. “And to me, it’s just a way of saying, ‘This one’s for you, Marshawn.’”\n \n\n   \n  With the win, the Cowboys move to 4-5-1 and second in the NFC East. While Dallas currently has a 7% chance to make the playoffs according to the NFL’s  playoff picture calculator , offensive play like Monday’s could see a strong end to the season and a chance to crash the postseason party.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/entertainment/ariana-grande-wicked-singapore-intrusion-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"08:17:00+00:00","title":"‘Serial intruder’ who accosted Ariana Grande at Wicked premiere in Singapore sentenced to 9 days in prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Johnson Wen, an Australian man known as 'Pyjama Man,' was sentenced to nine days in prison in Singapore for causing public annoyance during a Wicked: For Good premiere at Universal Studios Singapore.

Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:17 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An Australian “serial intruder” who accosted Ariana Grande during a Wicked premiere in Singapore was sentenced to 9 days in jail Monday for being a public nuisance.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson Wen, 26, pleaded guilty to one charge of causing annoyance to the public after he jumped over the barricade at a premiere for “Wicked: For Good” on November 13 and rushed toward Grande, according to  Singaporean news channel CNA. \n \n\n   \n   Video of the interaction  showed Wen running up to Grande and throwing his arms around her as she walked the yellow carpet with the Wicked cast at Universal Studios Singapore.\n \n\n   \n  Grande’s co-star Cynthia Erivo stepped in to push Wen away from the pop star, who appeared shocked, before security guards tackled him.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Grande’s representatives for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Wen, who goes by “Pyjama Man” on social media and calls himself the “Most Hated” troll, is a serial stage crasher.\n \n\n   \n  He was charged by Australian police after he interrupted a Katy Perry concert in Sydney earlier this year,  according to CNN-affiliate 9 News.  An Instagram page under his name also includes videos of Wen crashing concerts by the Chainsmokers and The Weeknd, as well as sports events including the FIFA Women’s World Cup.\n \n\n   \n  In a video of the intrusion posted to Instagram last week, Wen thanked Grande for “letting me jump on the yellow carpet with you.”\n \n\n   \n  Social media users criticized Wen in the comments, calling his actions “unhinged” and “embarrassing.”\n \n\n   \n  “Rushing a woman – any woman, let alone someone who has survived unimaginable trauma – is not a ‘prank.’ It’s not ‘a stunt.’ It’s not ‘funny.’ It’s pathetic, dangerous, and shows a total lack of respect for boundaries, safety, and basic human decency,” said one Instagram user.\n \n\n   \n  Grande has  spoken openly  about suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following a suicide bombing at her concert in Manchester, United Kingdom in May 2017, which killed 22 people.\n \n\n   \n  Grande has not commented publicly on the counter with Wen. Erivo alluded to it during a special Screen Actors Guild screening in Los Angeles Saturday, according to  Entertainment Weekly. \n \n\n   \n  Sitting next to Grande, Erivo said “We have come through some s****. We have come through some stuff in our lives, in our daily workings. I mean… even this week.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had to really deal with some stuff, and this move has allowed us to really grow as people, as friends, as sisters, as artists, as actresses,” Erivo said, according to Entertainment Weekly.\n \n\n   \n  During Wen’s sentencing, District Judge Christopher Goh told Wen he was “attention seeking,” while Deputy Public Prosecutor Jane Lim called Wen a “serial intruder” with a “glaring lack of remorse,” CNA reported.\n \n\n   \n  Singapore is known for its strict no nonsense laws, designed to maintain public order and cleanliness, which include a ban on chewing gum sales.\n \n\n   \n  Wen, who maintained a faint smile throughout the proceedings, said he was going to stop stage crashing and that he’s been “getting in trouble,” according to CNA.\n \n\n   \n  Goh said while Wen has no criminal record in Singapore, this isn’t the first time he’s done something like this.\n \n\n   \n  “And it does not appear that you had faced any sort of consequences for your past acts, and perhaps you thought that the same will occur here, that is to say, you would have suffered no consequences for the same acts here,” said the judge, according to CNA.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Wen, you are wrong. You should be mindful that there are always consequences for one’s actions,” the judge said, adding he hoped the prison sentence would end Wen’s behavior “for good.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/roblox-ai-age-verification-youth-safety","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"08:08:00-05:00","title":"Roblox to Require Age Verification to Prevent Kids from Chatting with Adults","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Roblox, the global online gaming platform with over 150 million users—including one-third under 13—is introducing mandatory age verification for chat features in response to a wave of lawsuits and public outcry over child grooming and abuse.

kids. New AI age verification aims to block them from chatting with adults \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:08 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If Roblox users want to chat on the online gaming platform, they’ll soon have to verify their age by providing a government ID or by letting an artificial intelligence age estimation tool photograph their face.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes as the platform faces a string of lawsuits and other claims that it has enabled sexual predators to connect with and abuse children. Roblox said the updated policy will make it easier to prevent young users from connecting with adult strangers.\n \n\n   \n  Roblox is a platform where users can create and play online games and interact with each other. Unlike many other online platforms, Roblox allows users under the age of 13; the platform has long advertised itself as a fun way for children to learn how to code. It has more than 150 million users globally, one third of whom are under 13.\n \n\n   \n  But the company has come under a microscope following reports of children being groomed, abused and, in some cases, even  kidnapped  by adults they met on Roblox.\n \n\n   \n  The attorneys general of  Kentucky  and  Louisiana  filed separate lawsuits accusing Roblox of harming children earlier this year. Florida’s attorney general also filed a  criminal subpoena  seeking information from the company last month and calling Roblox a “breeding ground for predators.”\n \n\n   \n  Individual families have also sued the company, including  Becca Dallas , who alleges her 15-year-old son, Ethan, died by suicide after being groomed via Roblox and messaging site Discord.\n \n\n   \n  Roblox already has some policies and features in place meant to protect young users; for example, it offers parental controls, blocks the sharing of photos and personal information and uses human and AI text and voice moderation. It also requires users to verify their age in order to access certain “18+” experiences, such as games with heavy violence or crude humor. But the update announced Tuesday is expected to greatly increase the number of users verifying their age on the platform, executives said on a call with reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “Our priority is safety and civility,” said Roblox Chief Safety Officer Matt Kaufman. “We want to make Roblox a safe, positive, age-appropriate experience for everybody. We set extremely high standards for ourselves, and we understand that the public expects the same from us.”\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s announcement coincides with a planned “virtual protest” within Roblox, planned by the nonprofit ParentsTogether Action, to call for more youth safety features on the platform, including stronger default privacy protections for users under 13.   It also comes amid a wider push by online platforms to determine users’ ages to protect young people;  YouTube  and  Meta  are among the other popular apps using AI for age estimates, although the tools vary across platforms.\n \n\n   \n  Under the new policy, all users will be required to verify their age before accessing chat features on Roblox.\n \n\n   \n  If users choose not to upload an ID, they’ll have to photograph their faces so AI can estimate their age, using technology from identity verification firm Persona. The tool uses the front camera on a user’s device and prompts them to move their face in specific directions, in an effort to ensure a real person is doing the verification. The AI will place users in an estimated age range — under 9, 9-12, 13-15, 16-17, 18-20 or 21+ — and they’ll only be allowed to chat with other users in or near that range.\n \n\n   \n  A user estimated to be 12 years old, for example, would be able to chat with users ages 15 and younger but not 16 and older, according to Roblox.\n \n\n   \n  If the AI places someone into the wrong age group, users over 13 can upload an ID to correct their age. Parents whose accounts are linked to their child’s via Roblox’s parental control tools can also correct their child’s age. (ID checks are available only to users older than 13, likely because online privacy regulations are more stringent for younger children.)\n \n\n   \n  Roblox says the images of users’ faces will be used only for age estimation, and they’ll be deleted after users are placed in an age bucket.\n \n\n   \n  “We see these changes as a way to help ensure users are able to socialize with others in age groups that are appropriate but also help limit contact between minors and adults that they do not know,” said Rajiv Bhatia, Roblox vice president and head of user and discovery product.\n \n\n   \n  Roblox declined to share a specific accuracy rate for its AI age estimation technology. Kaufman said it is “typically pretty accurate within one or two years” for users between 5 and 25 years old.\n \n\n   \n  Some users have found  workarounds  for other platforms’ face scan age estimation technology, such as by using images of video game characters or selfies of other people. But Kaufman said   Roblox’s technology has “fairly robust fraud checks in place” to determine whether the person is “live” and “moving around and following instructions.” He added that the system also looks for “other anomalies, like people trying to repeat use the same face over and over.”\n \n\n   \n  Roblox will roll out age verification on a voluntary basis   starting Tuesday. It will become mandatory in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands in December, and globally early next year.\n \n\n   \n   Correction: A previous version of this story misstated Roblox’s age requirements for certain content. Users must verify their age in order to access certain experiences marked “18+”. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/baltimore-key-bridge-rebuild-cost-doubles","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"06:46:00-05:00","title":"Costs more than double to rebuild vital Baltimore bridge destroyed by cargo ship","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore collapsed in March 2024 after a cargo ship, the Dali, struck one of its pillars following two catastrophic electrical failures that disabled critical propulsion and steering systems.

heartbreaking picture of girls’ last moments at Camp Mystic \n       \n  By Alaa Elassar and Holly Yan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Weeks before 8-year-old Eloise “ Lulu ” Peck was carried off by the violent Texas floods that swallowed  Camp Mystic  in a surge of darkness and debris, she had suddenly begun to fear the forces that would one day claim her.\n \n\n   \n  She filled a page in her notebook with a drawing of rising water, black skies and the kind of creeping dread that children rarely have words for.\n \n\n   \n  “(The drawings were) a quiet reflection of the worries that lingered in her gentle heart,” her parents wrote in the lawsuit they filed on her behalf. “That she left this world in the very way she feared most is a truth too heavy to bear.”\n \n\n   \n  In the pitch-black, storm-lashed hours before dawn on Independence Day, surging floodwaters ravaged Hunt and Kerr County in central Texas, including the summer camp filled with sleeping children.\n \n\n   \n  Four months’ worth of rain fell in  just hours  and the nearby Guadalupe River rose  to 30  feet, sweeping homes, cars, campers and cabins downstream.\n \n\n   \n  The catastrophic flooding killed  27 girls and counselors  at Camp Mystic.\n \n\n   \n  Lulu’s family, along with the families of 17 oth﻿er campers and two counselors, have filed  lawsuits  against the all-girls Christian camp and its owners, accusing them of gross negligence.\n \n\n   \n  The court filings accuse the camp of failing to move cabins out of flood-prone areas, responding poorly to the emergency, and putting profits ahead of the safety of the girls in their care.\n \n\n   \n  The four lawsuits, filed last week, are the first attempt by grieving parents to seek accountability for the flood that turned a  haven of faith and childhood friendships  into a scene of unimaginable loss.\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions surrounding their deaths were marked by absolute horror, physical pain, and emotional distress, all of which were foreseeable and preventable had Defendants acted with even minimal care for their safety,” the Peck family lawsuit said.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuits provide an account of the living nightmare that unfolded that morning on July 4 and shed light on the last moments of young girls struggling to survive. Here’s what we learned.\n \n\n   \n    Holding on for dear life\n \n\n   \n  The children taken by the current of the furious river clung to the branches of trees, according to one of the lawsuits, their bodies engulfed in foul, mud-laden water swirling with debris. They held on, blind to whatever threats drifted beneath the murky surface.\n \n\n   \n  “Some victims survived for a period of time, while trapped within the cabins, enduring prolonged physical suffering, panic, and terror as the water level rose beyond their reach,” the Peck family lawsuit alleges.\n \n\n   \n  “Others were pulled into the current and swept away into the darkness. These children faced the unimaginable; a slow and terrifying awareness that they were being overcome by the flood, alone in darkness, unable to reach safety,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  As the rain poured down and lightning split the sky, counselors in two cabins near a hill made the desperate choice to flee the rapidly rising waters, the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  They climbed through windows, dragging terrified girls into the deluge, running across mud-slicked ground to the top of a hill. Hours passed as they waited, soaked and shivering in the relentless rain, listening “to screams for help from other cabins that housed their friends and fellow campers,” says the lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors who perished: Anna Margaret Bellows, Lila Bonner, Chloe Childress, Molly DeWitt, Katherine Ferruzzo, Lainey Landry and Blakely McCrory.\n \n\n   \n  Five other cabins were evacuated to Rec Hall, an older, two-story structure on higher ground than the lower lying cabins, according to that lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  From their vantage point, they could see the counselors in the cabins that were told not to evacuate “flashing SOS on their flashlights, begging the Camp for help.”\n \n\n   \n  Those cabins are where little girls had been sleeping, mere steps from the swelling river.\n \n\n   \n  In the Twins cabins, girls startled awake by thunder begged Edward Eastland, a camp director and the co-owners’ son, to allow them to evacuate.\n \n\n   \n  “He told them they had to stay because the water would go back down,” the lawsuit said. But it didn’t.\n \n\n   \n  “The girls got on their top bunks, as the water pressed them against the cabin ceiling. Several girls decided to swim out to avoid drowning in the cabin, and others were swept out by rushing waters. Some girls never made it out of the cabin,” stated that same lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  About 30 minutes later, Eastland and several girls were washed out to a tree nearby, where they held on through the night. Some campers tried to grasp its branches, only to be torn away by the raging current; others bobbed by, unable to reach it.\n \n\n   \n  “Girls in the tree watched in horror as their friends floated by begging for help,” the lawsuit said.\n \n\n   \n  Camp Mystic attorney Mikal Watts told CNN that despite spotty cell coverage and chaotic conditions, Eastland and his father, Richard “Dick” Eastland, were actively helping evacuate campers within 2 hours of receiving the first warning, emphasizing that the camp had moved 166 girls to safety during those critical hours.\n \n\n   \n  Dick Eastland, who co-owned Camp Mystic with his wife, Tweety, died trying to  save some of the girls , a family spokesperson has said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Russian Roulette with the lives of the little girls’\n \n\n   \n  The trees the campers clung to had weathered floods before, but nothing like this. It was Texas’  deadliest  freshwater flooding in  more than a century .\n \n\n   \n  Long before the morning of July 4, Camp Mystic’s owners knew how powerful and dangerous the Guadalupe River was, the lawsuits allege.\n \n\n   \n  The camp’s history of flooding is long and deadly, with major inundations in 1932, 1978 and 1984, and the flooding of a nearby camp in 1987, Peck family lawsuit said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, Camp Mystic failed to build adequate warning systems, evacuation routes, or modern flood safeguards, the victims’ family lawsuits allege.\n \n\n   \n  Eastland warned for decades about the hidden dangers of the beautiful but volatile Guadalupe River, a peril he saw firsthand while running his family’s youth camp alongside its banks.\n \n\n   \n  He successfully pushed for a new flood warning system after 10 children at a nearby camp were swept to their deaths in 1987, and in recent years served on the board of the local river authority as it supported renewed efforts to improve warnings on the Guadalupe.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m sure there will be other drownings,” Eastland said in a 1990 interview with the Austin American-Statesman. “People don’t heed the warnings.”\n \n\n   \n  Eastland has been praised as a hero for his efforts to save campers and remembered as a beloved figure by generations who spent their summers in the idyllic riverside refuge. His legacy is less clear as a public steward of the sometimes deadly river that ultimately took his life.\n \n\n   \n  About a decade after it was installed, the warning system Eastland had championed in the late ‘80s had already become antiquated and broken. The river authority ultimately shut it down in 1999, saying it was “unreliable with some of the system’s stations not reporting information,” according to an article in the Kerrville Daily Times. Yet periodic attempts to adopt a more modern flood-monitoring system, including one with warning sirens that might have alerted campers in July, repeatedly failed to gain traction – stalled by low budgets, some local opposition and a lack of state support.\n \n\n   \n  But parents point out another concern.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the cabins had been located in FEMA’s 100-year “Special Flood Hazard Area” up until 2013. That’s when the camp petitioned FEMA to remove most of the cabins from floodplain maps, says the lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors. The move did nothing but spare the Eastlands costly insurance premiums and expensive renovations, the filing states.\n \n\n   \n  “Since July 1932, Camp Mystic knew that cabins that housed defenseless little girls sat in the bullseye of potential flood waters from the Guadalupe River and never said a word about it to trusting parents,” the Peck family lawsuit says. “Since that date, Camp Mystic continued to play Russian Roulette with the lives of the little girls, disregarding what Camp Mystic knew would be an unspeakable tragedy when the flood hit those cabins.”\n \n\n   \n  Watts argued that it is not correct that FEMA was petitioned: “The bottom line is that Camp Mystic was there before FEMA was ever promulgated by Congress. It didn’t even exist. The original maps, with all due respect to the forefathers of FEMA, were kind of done on paper and crayon. It wasn’t very scientific. Now we have digital imagery. We have elevation to a 10th of an inch. We know what’s actually in a 100-year floodplain.”\n \n\n   \n  While Camp Mystic sympathizes with the grieving families, “We disagree with several accusations and misinformation in the legal filings regarding the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, who lost his life as well,” camp counsel Jeff Ray said in  a statement  last week.\n \n\n   \n    A preventable disaster\n \n\n   \n  Although camp representatives say the Eastland family prioritized the children’s safety, the narrative presented in the families’ lawsuits — which the defense has not yet formally answered to — offers a starkly different account of what happened:\n \n\n   \n  In their final hours, Camp Mystic’s young campers, many of whom likely still slept with  stuffed animals  and needed help braiding their hair, faced a terror their parents can barely bring themselves to imagine.\n \n\n   \n  As the dark waters crept across their cabin floors, inch by inch, some of the girls climbed onto their top bunks, trying to keep their heads above the rising flood, feeling the current tug at their legs.\n \n\n   \n  Others spent their last panicked moments in darkness, surrounded by cries and the roar of a river that had swallowed the world outside.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the campers piled into Richard “Dick” Eastland’s Tahoe, desperate to escape the neck-deep water.\n \n\n   \n  His car was submerged and found the next day, appearing to have been “smashed against a tree. All inside were killed,” said the lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors.\n \n\n   \n  “Their parents are left to live every single day for the rest of their lives with the intense grief and the thoughts of what their babies endured that fateful night,” says the lawsuit filed by the families of Virginia “Wynne” Naylor, Hadley Hanna, Virginia Hollis, Jane “Janie” Hunt, Lucy Lee Dillon, and Kellyanne Lytal.\n \n\n   \n  What haunts them most is the belief that their daughters didn’t have to die.\n \n\n   \n  According to the lawsuits, the camp had no meaningful evacuation plan. Even as floodwaters breached the cabins, no order to flee was given until it was far too late — despite the fact that safer ground was just a few hundred feet away. A hill only 20 yards from Bubble Inn could have been reached “in a matter of seconds,” one of the lawsuits says.\n \n\n   \n  Camp Mystic’s entire emergency plan fit on a single page, offering a few instructions for all potential disasters, according to the same lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  The last two lines of the document instructed children to remain inside their cabins during flooding and reassured them that “all cabins are constructed on high, safe locations.”\n \n\n   \n  “To instruct children to stay in a cabin with rising flood waters was ultimately a death sentence,” the lawsuit filed by the families of the six campers says.\n \n\n   \n  Watts  told CNN  that the camp’s decision to keep everyone sheltered in place followed long-standing safety guidance from local and national authorities, who warned against moving through floodwaters.\n \n\n   \n  The parents allege that for years, the camp concealed that many cabins sat in or near dangerous floodplains, and that the camp lacked even the most basic tools like walkie-talkies, communication protocols and a real plan to protect their daughters. Counselors and campers, they say, were left to improvise.\n \n\n   \n  The camp  responded  to the allegations outlined in the lawsuits last week.\n \n\n   \n  The horrific flood was “unprecedented,” Ray said. “We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area.”\n \n\n   \n    The aftermath and denial\n \n\n   \n  Camp Mystic has announced plans to  partially reopen  next summer for its 100th anniversary.\n \n\n   \n  The section of the camp close to the Guadalupe River will remain closed. The more recent expansion, which sits uphill and was not damaged in the flooding, will reopen.\n \n\n   \n  While parents remain frozen in the darkest chapter of their lives, still waking to the nightmares of what their daughters endured, still fighting for answers, they say Camp Mystic has already begun turning the page.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the family of  9-year-old Ellen Getten  says that even as families were learning to live with an empty bed, the camp was promoting its reopening, soliciting donations and preparing to return “to business as usual.” The filing calls it “not only unthinkable – it is offensive to the memories of the deceased and the families and loved ones they left behind.”\n \n\n   \n  To the parents, the message felt unmistakable: the camp was ready to move on, eager to reopen its gates for summer 2026, while they remained knee-deep in grief, still fighting for the truth.\n \n\n   \n  The grieving families of five other girls later joined the Getten lawsuit. Linnie Anne McCown, Abby Lynn Pohl, Margaret Gaffney Sheedy, Mary Barrett Stevens and Greta Katherine Toranzo were just 8 to 10 years old when floodwater swept them away.\n \n\n   \n  “The horrifying nature of these girls’ untimely deaths cannot be overstated,” the updated lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “The overpowering waters cascading through the Camp … did the inevitable by tearing children away from the roofs, doors, furniture, trees, and hands of others that they clung to, and propelling them down the raging river into the inescapable darkness.”\n \n\n   \n  Months after the flood, the families say they have yet to hear meaningful acknowledgment or responsibility from those in charge. The lawsuits describe an institution concerned more with its reputation than its reckoning — fixated on reopening a for-profit camp while parents struggle through a grief that has no end date.\n \n\n   \n  The world may be ready to move on. But these families cannot — not until someone answers for what happened to their daughters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/world/parasocial-cambridge-dictionary-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:21:00-05:00","title":"Cambridge Dictionary’s 2025 word of the year captures an ‘unhealthy’ modern phenomenon","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cambridge Dictionary has named 'parasocial' as its 2025 Word of the Year, reflecting a growing trend where individuals form intense emotional bonds with people they don’t know—such as celebrities, influencers, or even AI chatbots.

\n   \n   Cambridge Dictionary  has named its  word of the year  for 2025, alighting on “ parasocial ,” used to describe a connection that people feel with someone they don’t know – or even with an artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  The term was coined in 1956 by sociologists Donald Horton and Richard Wohl, who wanted to describe how television viewers formed “para-social” relationships with TV personalities, the dictionary said in a statement Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  This phenomenon continues today, as social media users form parasocial relationships with celebrities, influencers and online personalities with whom they have no personal connection.\n \n\n   \n  A key example cited by Cambridge Dictionary is singer Taylor Swift, who announced her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce this year, with many fans talking of their heartfelt feelings toward a couple that the vast majority had never met.\n \n\n   \n  Another is British singer Lily Allen, whose latest album “West End Girl” tells the story of a breakup and sparked a “parasocial interest in her love life,” according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  And use of the term has surged this year, particularly as concerns over the connections that some people have started to develop with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT have come to the fore.\n \n\n   \n  Colin McIntosh, a lexicographer at the Cambridge Dictionary, said the word “captures the 2025 zeitgeist” and demonstrates how language changes.\n \n\n   \n  “What was once a specialist academic term has become mainstream,” he said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise,” McIntosh added.\n \n\n   \n  “The language around parasocial phenomena is evolving fast, as technology, society and culture shift and mutate: from celebrities to chatbots, parasocial trends are fascinating for those who are interested in the development of language,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Simone Schnall, Professor of Experimental Social Psychology at the University of Cambridge, said in the statement that the word “is an inspired choice.”\n \n\n   \n  “The rise of parasocial relationships has redefined fandom, celebrity and, with AI, how ordinary people interact online,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,” Schnall added.\n \n\n   \n  “This leads to a sense that people ‘know’ those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it’s completely one sided.”\n \n\n   \n  Cambridge Dictionary also highlighted a number of other words that it said have had a “significant impact” this year.\n \n\n   \n  Among their number is “slop,” defined as “content on the internet that is of very low quality, especially when it is created by artificial intelligence,” as well as “memeify,” or “to turn an event, image, person, etc. into a meme.”\n \n\n   \n  And the dictionary added 6,000 new words this year, with notable newbies including “delulu,” “skibidi” and “tradwife.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/air-traffic-controller-shortage-ai","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"06:30:00-05:00","title":"America is grappling with an air traffic controller shortage.

Can AI help? \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The longest  government shutdown  in US history shook travel plans across America earlier this month as a shortage of air traffic controllers resulted in thousands of  delayed or canceled flights .\n \n\n   \n  But even the  end of the shutdown  doesn’t fix the the broader  air traffic controller shortage  that’s been plaguing American flyers for years. Artificial intelligence, with its ability to analyze troves of data and potentially upend industries, might be able to help. After all, some in the field have called AI as impactful on everyday life as  electricity  or  fire. \n \n\n   \n  While AI does have some practical uses in aviation like crunching data on  weather patterns  or  aircraft trajectories , experts highlighted a range of reasons why the technology won’t be a substitute for air traffic controllers anytime soon – or likely ever.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a human system, and it’s human-centered for sure because it demands almost near perfect performance,” said Ross Sagun, a former pilot and air traffic controller with more than 50 years of flight experience. “The smallest mistakes can turn into giant disasters.”\n \n\n   \n    Why AI won’t replace traffic controllers\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers play a critical role in aviation, guiding jets safely both on the ground and in the air, ensuring safe distances are maintained between aircraft and communicating with pilots – skills that require multitasking, quick decision-making and intense concentration. The Federal Aviation Administration says it handles more than 44,000 flights a day, and 5,500 are in the sky at peak operational times.\n \n\n   \n  Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, described the job as demanding “unique skill and precision” in his  written testimony  for a hearing in March before the US House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Aviation of the Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure. He called air traffic controllers the “backbone” of the National Airspace System, adding that they “require rigorous training, a mastery of complex systems, and the ability to perform under immense pressure.”\n \n\n   \n  That pressure is exactly why the job can’t be outsourced to AI, according to Sagun. Hearing emotion and stress in a pilot or fellow controller’s voice is a key signal that something is wrong and it’s unclear whether AI can detect those cues.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s where you jump in, you scream for help, and we get people over there to take over the situation,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The rate at which AI is evolving and changing would also make it hard to certify the technology, he added.\n \n\n   \n  There’s little to no margin for error in air traffic control given the safety risks. Even if the technology were to be used for automating the process of guiding aircraft as they land or take off, human workers would still need to manage unforeseen circumstances, according to Amar Gupta, a research scientist with MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n \n\n   \n  And some research as far back as the early 2000s suggests that type of arrangement, in which a human worker intervenes in the event of an emergency or automation error, may not always be effective. One study from 2005, for example, found that controllers were more likely to detect incidents manually than when using an automated tool that wasn’t 100% reliable.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers might not be as vigilant if automation were to play a bigger role in their jobs since they wouldn’t be as actively engaged in the environment, according to Michael McCormick, associate professor and program coordinator for air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n \n\n   \n  “That is the one thing that humans are very poor at doing — that very quickly, you lose vigilance, generally through boredom,” McCormick said.\n \n\n   \n    How AI could be helpful for air traffic controllers\n \n\n   \n  Experts say there is a place for AI to help with air traffic control, but it would just be to assist with duties rather than replacing jobs.\n \n\n   \n  With many air traffic controllers  either retiring or finding other jobs during the shutdown,  such help may be welcome. Air traffic controller staffing has plummeted since 2012, according to data cited by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), and the  Federal Aviation Administration’s Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan  indicates the number of certified professional controllers fell below targets in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  AI could be useful for helping controllers understand weather patterns, potentially helping to predict the possibility of storms, according to Sagun.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA is working toward an upgraded system that uses AI to help analyze trajectories from aircraft in flight, estimate possible conflicts and provide recommendations to controllers, according to McCormick, though he says it is still years from testing and implementation.\n \n\n   \n  Searidge Technologies, owned by United Kingdom-based air traffic control services provider NATS, has developed  an AI system  for monitoring ground movements and facilitating communication with pilots.\n \n\n   \n  The technology is being used at London’s Heathrow Airport to track aircraft exiting the runway and Florida’s Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to monitor gate occupancy.\n \n\n   \n  The company says on its website that the technology isn’t a replacement for human control. It’s seeing “strong global interest” in its system and expects more “operational rollout and demonstration sites in the coming year,” Ron Reddick, vice president of global sales for Searidge Technologies, said in an emailed statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But don’t expect major upgrades to happen overnight in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Implementing new technologies into air traffic control requires rigorous testing and is a lengthy ordeal, backed   by infrastructure designed to last for decades. The Department of Transportation plans to upgrade the FAA’s air traffic control system by 2028 with “all new hardware” and “all new software,” Secretary Sean Duffy  said in May . But those upgrades are now going to take longer than initially planned, Duffy  recently told reporters  at a press conference.\n \n\n   \n  “The entire process takes years,” said McCormick when asked how long it would take to implement AI in current air traffic control systems. “We’re in initial stages. We’re not far down the road.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/style/why-women-art-less-valuable-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"04:49:00-05:00","title":"Why we pay less for art made by women","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the persistent gender gap in the art market, where artworks by women consistently sell for significantly less than those by men, despite comparable artistic merit.

That record is currently held by Georgia O’Keeffe’s 1932 painting “Jimson Weed/White Flower No.1,” which fetched $44.4 million in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  Auctioneers at Sotheby’s have valued “El sueño (La cama)” — “The Dream (The Bed)” — at between $40 and $60 million. Kahlo, who died in 1954, already holds the second-highest auction record for a female artist. “Diego y yo” (“Diego and I”), a self-portrait from 1949, featuring her husband, the artist Diego Rivera, fetched $34.9 million in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  While these are hefty price tags, they are dwarfed by the equivalent for works by men. Even if Kahlo’s painting hits the upper valuation, it will be just a fraction of the male record. Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi” sold for an astounding  $450.3 million at Christies in 2017 .\n \n\n   \n  The gender gap is not limited to dead artists. Earlier this year, South African Marlene Dumas — who only last week became the first contemporary female artist to join the  Louvre’s  permanent collection — set a record for the highest amount paid for a living female artist. “Miss January,” a large-scale portrait of a semi-nude woman, sold for $13.6 million in May, topping Jenny Saville’s “Propped,” which sold for $12.4 million in 2018. Dumas’ record is not even 15% of the current record for a work by a living male artist  –  Jeff Koons’ “Rabbit” sculpture, which sold for just north of $91 million in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  So what is behind this massive disparity? Experts believe misogyny, ageism and male-dominated auction houses and museums are factors influencing how art by women is valued.\n \n\n   \n  A 2021 study highlighted a stark gender bias in how society perceives art. Renée B. Adams, a professor of finance at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School, was the lead author of “Gendered Prices,” published in  The Review of Financial Studies  that year.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers showed two groups of participants an identical series of AI-generated artworks and asked them to rate them. One group was shown the works with a male artist’s signature, while others saw the attribution as female. The works supposedly signed by a man were rated higher by regular gallery-goers than those apparently done by a woman.\n \n\n   \n  Adams is currently studying secret postcard auctions, where the artist is supposedly anonymous. “Sometimes, in order to attract people to bid on these postcards, they get very famous artists to participate,” she said, adding that in those cases an artist’s identity can often be inferred from their style.\n \n\n   \n  “If buyers can’t infer identity, there’s no gender difference in price, but as soon as they think they know who the person is, there’s a gender difference in price.”\n \n\n   \n  Adams said the “magnitude” of the gap in the art world stands out from other sectors. “The art market blows all the gender wage gap numbers out of the water,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The discount in art prices is not driven by merit, but by factors related to societal perceptions of women. It has nothing to do with whether the painting is good or bad.”\n \n\n   \n  As part of her research for her 2020 book “Women Can’t Paint,” artist, writer and art historian Helen Gørrill took a forensic approach to auctioned art.\n \n\n   \n  “I created a spreadsheet of 5,000 paintings on the secondary market, so at big auctions like Sotheby’s, Christie’s, Phillips,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  This led to a startling discovery. Art signed by a man went up in value compared to unsigned work, and women’s artwork actually went down in value when signed, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She believes the art establishment highlights the success of artists like Saville, Kahlo, Bridget Riley and Yayoi Kusama to suggest progress.\n \n\n   \n  “The ones that are doing really well are being bandied up as an example of how well women are doing, but when you analyze it, we’re not at all,” she said. “In the ’90s, we had far more women succeeding. Now the success is being shared by far fewer women, but on a greater scale,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Gørrill is currently working on two more books on the subject and said her latest research is no less alarming. Gørrill spoke to artists who were dismissed after having a baby and told their work couldn’t be sold “because people don’t trust it’s going to achieve the value of a male artist.”\n \n\n   \n  “I spoke to some big dealers and they all said their collectors lose trust in women once they’ve had a kid because they’re no longer going to be able to focus fully on their artwork,” she said. “So the value of a woman artist essentially dips because of biology.”\n \n\n   \n  The belief has even been internalized by some in the profession, among them renowned British artist Tracey Emin. In an 2014 interview, she told  Red  Magazine that she thought having children would compromise her work. “There are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men.”\n \n\n   \n  Ageism, and even beauty standards, have also been been cited as issues women face. Gørrill told CNN that one artist she spoke to recalled a dealer telling her to get Botox because “she looked haggard.” She added: “Her exact words to me were, ‘but men are allowed to be old and ugly.’”\n \n\n   \n  Gørrill lays much of the blame for the situation at the door of museums. “By museums not collecting as many female artists as men, it has a massive impact on collections and on values attributed on the secondary market to artwork, and also what collectors perceive as being valuable or validated as an artwork.”\n \n\n   \n  Valeria Napoleone, an Italian art collector and patron, has spent almost three decades building a collection by women artists. When she started in 1997, she “couldn’t understand why women were sidelined just because of gender,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I told myself ‘I want to create a choir of female voices who have been silenced throughout art history.’” Today, some 560 artworks are spread between her homes and storage units in London, New York and Milan.\n \n\n   \n  While the “discourse” in the wider art world around gender equality has changed, according to Napoleone, there remains a “black hole” when it comes to museums and auction houses, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “As radical as the world of contemporary art is believed to be, it’s a male-dominated field in terms of artists, museums, directors — the whole ecosystem.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s very important to readdress art history through the eyes of a new generation of curators. You don’t want female artists to be like a decorative object on a man’s suit. You want the artist to become part of the fibre of the suit,” she said. “It’s going to take generations to balance it.”\n \n\n   \n  Harriet Loffler is curator at The Women’s Art Collection at Murray Edwards College at Cambridge University — the biggest collection of women’s art in Europe — is more upbeat.\n \n\n   \n  She welcomed the Kahlo auction for “shining a light” on the representation of women. “These success stories are fantastic for women artists,” she told CNN, adding that there have always been female artists but the “canonical” approach to art history has centred on men.\n \n\n   \n  While the museum houses works by such luminaries as Barbara Hepworth, Mary Cassatt, Paula Rego and Tracey Emin, “what’s amazing about our collection is that it’s a constellation not stars,” she told CNN. “The artists aren’t all talking about what it is to be a woman, but they all have something to say. They take up space and there are a number of works that really talk about the symbolic erasure of women artists across art history.”\n \n\n   \n  She believes things are changing, with museums taking affirmative action to redress the imbalance but said: “There is still lots of work to be done.”\n \n\n   \n  On the other side of the Atlantic, the National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA) was established in Washington DC in the 1980s “in part to rectify the lack of representation of women across art history,” according to Kathryn Wat, its chief curator and deputy director for art, programs and public engagement.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that engaging a global audience is critical to changing the landscape for women artists,” Wat said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “While women artists have greater recognition now, disparities in scholarly research, the content of museum collections, and market value persist. Statistically women artists continue to be undervalued and overlooked by the broader art market. Our dual mission of advocacy and exhibition remains essential,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The legacy of gender inequality continues to influence economic valuation. Having more and deeper research, more exhibitions, and further exposure of women artists will have an impact on their value within the art market.”\n \n\n   \n  Anna Di Stasi, head of Latin American art at Sotheby’s, agrees. “In recent years, we’ve witnessed a real and measurable shift — not just in awareness, but also in market confidence and increasing gallery representation and institutional support for women artists,” she said, adding “outstanding results” have been achieved by other female artists, including O’Keeffe and Lee Krasner.\n \n\n   \n  While “El sueño (La cama)” may prove record-breaking, Di Stasi believes “what’s also exciting is the idea of that record continuing to be broken by other artists in the years to come.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/europe/italy-women-femicides-challenges-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00+00:00","title":"Italy has a femicide problem.

Critics say Prime Minister Georgia Meloni should do more to fix it \n       \n  By Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:32 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Italian model and entrepreneur Pamela Genini had what many might consider an enviable life. The 29-year-old Milan resident was a successful real estate agent focused on high-commission seaside properties. A thriving influencer who was discovered on a popular reality TV program a decade earlier, she had just launched her own swimwear line with an influencer friend.\n \n\n   \n  In a country where the rate of unemployment and precarious employment for the under-30s is  stubbornly high ,  Genini had broken the mold.\n \n\n   \n  But one evening in mid-October, Genini’s 52-year-old ex-boyfriend Gianluca Soncin is alleged to have entered her apartment and fatally stabbed her. Police were called but arrived to find her dead on her balcony. Soncin was at her side, the investigating judge in the case said.\n \n\n   \n  Soncin, currently in solitary confinement awaiting formal charges, faces accusations of voluntary homicide, cruelty, stalking, and premeditation. His lawyer told CNN he had not yet answered any questions about what happened.\n \n\n   \n  Genini was the 72nd victim of femicide – usually defined as when a girl or woman is killed because of her gender, often by a current or former intimate partner – in Italy in 2025, according to the observatory group Non Una Di Meno (Not One Less), which keeps a tally of such killings. Four more women have been killed since Genini, according to the group, including Luciana Ronchi, 62, and 80-year-old Vanda Venditti. Six more cases are being examined as potential femicides.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, there were 116 cases of femicide, according to Non Una Di Meno, a slight decrease from the previous two years.\n \n\n   \n  Three years ago, Giorgia Meloni became Italy’s first female prime minister. Critics question whether she has  done enough  since to tackle increasing rates of violence against women in the country, or challenge persistent inequality in the workplace. Official figures show that birth rates dropped by 6.3% in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, and that some Italian women earn up to 40% less than men in the same jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Italy’s battle with femicide goes back decades. Meloni’s government has passed anti-stalking legislation tied to  previous femicides , and has made domestic violence an aggravating factor in sentencing, meaning those who are convicted in domestic violence cases now face longer prison terms for offenses, including life sentences in some cases.\n \n\n   \n  But many believe Meloni has not done as much in terms of prevention as they had expected.\n \n\n   \n  Meloni’s Education Ministry last week pushed forward a law that upholds the current ban on teaching sex education in kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, a curriculum  long seen by experts  as a precursor to educating young people about domestic violence and consent, with an eye to prevention.\n \n\n   \n  Meloni, who changed the name of the long-standing Ministry for Equal Opportunity to the Ministry for the Family, Birth Rate and Equal Opportunities upon her election, has framed the continuing ban on sex education as a way to prevent the introduction of “woke gender theory” in schools.\n \n\n   \n  But opposition groups argue that denying young people exposure to basic sex education keeps the country grounded in its patriarchal past. “While Europe moves forward, Italy is returning to the Middle Ages,” opposition parliamentarian Alessandro Zan said last week.\n \n\n   \n  Meloni’s office declined CNN’s request for comment on the issue, but she has in the past denied being against advancing women’s interests. As a single mother who supports the traditional family, she has  insisted  that it is “ridiculous” to accuse her of not doing enough for women.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s fake news against me,” she said recently, in an address she posted on her TikTok account. She consistently points to her government’s pledge to expand parental rights and give tax breaks to families based on the number of children they have. The Ministry for the Family, Birth Rate and Equal Opportunities also declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  Italy is one of the last European countries not to have compulsory sex education in the public school system, despite evidence  cited  by the United Nations that effective sex education offers an opportunity to teach about gender-based violence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just the  potential for domestic violence  that makes being a woman in Italy feel so challenging. Parity indicators, which include employment and confidence in having a family, are increasingly dismal. In 2024, Italy’s already low birth rate fell once again, to 1.18, marking the 16th year in a row of steady decline,  according  to Italy’s ISTAT national statistical institute. Provisional figures for the first seven months of 2025 showed a further drop, to 1.13.\n \n\n   \n  Women are blamed for not having babies, including by Meloni, who has touted the traditional family and pushed forward legislation  criminalizing surrogacy  and allowing anti-abortion activists to access clinics. At an event in 2023, Meloni said too many young women were being pressured to focus on their careers first, and put off having children.\n \n\n   \n  Her critics say, however, that she has done little to help provide affordable child care options, despite campaign promises ahead of the 2022 election that launched her to power. Instead, proposed plans to build day-care centers were  slashed  from her first budget.\n \n\n   \n  The ISTAT fertility report identifies several factors in the declining birth rate, including an increasingly small pool of potential parents due to the lower number of babies born in the country since the 1970s. “Employment insecurity, particularly the prevalence of temporary work contracts, and low wages, also have a heavy impact on Italy’s falling birth rate,” the study says.\n \n\n   \n  Ariana Ricci, a 32-year-old human resources manager, voted for Meloni’s hard-right Brothers of Italy party in 2022, hoping she would prioritize efforts to tackle wage disparity, reproductive rights, and women’s safety. Ricci, who graduated from the prestigious Bocconi University in Milan, also studied overseas but says she wants to stay in Italy and be successful there, raise a family and own her own home.\n \n\n   \n  At the moment, however, she’s renting a room in a student apartment-share in Rome in order to avoid moving back in with her parents. She says she’s barely able to pay her rent and utility bills. She is easily employable on paper, but falls into the “precarious” job set, meaning no one will give her the coveted permanent contract, which comes with job security and ample benefits, but which research shows tends to be offered first to men.\n \n\n   \n  Ricci works on temporary contracts, which do not afford her job security, but have become an increasingly common way for companies to avoid paying generous benefits, especially mandatory maternity leave. Men are not granted paternity leave in Italy.\n \n\n   \n  “If I were to start a family on a temporary contract, I wouldn’t get my maternity leave paid, I wouldn’t get my job back, and I couldn’t afford childcare even if I did have a job to go back to,” she said. “What incentive is that to have a family?”\n \n\n   \n  She had hoped a female leader would see the bind many young, employable women seem to be in. “I’m seeing a focus on international affairs instead,” she told CNN. “Meloni has made Italy look great abroad, but she has forgotten us here in Italy in many ways.”\n \n\n   \n  The World Economic Forum’s 2025  Global Gender Gap Report  ranks Italy 85th out of 148 countries on issues like economic participation and opportunity, education, health, and political empowerment.\n \n\n   \n  While Italy has risen two rankings since Meloni’s election, it remains among the lowest-placed countries in Europe for the overall gender gap. Notably, Italy fell to 117th place on women’s economic participation, dropping six points since the 2024 report.\n \n\n   \n  Women’s participation in Italy’s labor market has slumped in the past two years to a rate of 41.5% while men enjoy nearly 60% participation. And they earn up to 40% less than men in some sectors, according to the Global Gender Gap Report.\n \n\n   \n  Only 39% of management positions in Italy are held by women, and just 7% of Italian companies have female CEOs, according to  research  published last year by the Bocconi School of Management’s Executive Women Observatory.\n \n\n   \n  Elly Schlein, the leader of Italy’s main opposition Democratic Party, has been one of the most vocal critics of the Meloni government’s record on women’s issues.\n \n\n   \n  Asked on a TV program last week about new budget cuts proposed by Meloni’s government that are currently under debate in the Italian senate, Schlein said: “The hardest hit are women. When you cut welfare, schools, and funding for services for people with disabilities, the burden of care falls on families, and within families, on women.”\n \n\n   \n  But not all women agree. Beatrice Costa couldn’t be happier with Meloni as she sits at a coffee bar in central Rome, holding her six-month-old baby in her arms. Her three-year-old is around the corner in a state-run nursery school until lunchtime.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like I have permission to be a mother,” Costa told CNN, explaining that she had felt pressure growing up to have a career over family, or at least start her career first before thinking about becoming a mother. “The pressure not to have children is strong, the pressure to work outside the home, to give up the dream of having a family, to just get a dog instead, is hard to fight.”\n \n\n   \n  Costa, who has a university degree in communications, had already given birth to her first child when Meloni was elected. “I don’t know if we had a second child because of her focus on the traditional family, or if we would have anyway, but I’m glad I am empowered to be a mother,” she said, adding that her husband has a good job as a tax accountant and that they were given a home by her parents, who also help with childcare.\n \n\n   \n  “Some might say I have it easy, but I feel like I’m carrying out an Italian tradition and finally I have permission to do it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/what-we-know-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump Urged Release of Epstein Files; House to Vote on Full Disclosure","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The House Oversight Committee is preparing to vote on releasing a comprehensive set of Epstein-related records, including 20,000 pages from Epstein’s estate that detail emails showing Epstein’s alleged interactions with Donald Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell, particularly in response to a lawsuit by Virginia Giuffre.

Here’s what we know about them \n       \n  By Haven Orecchio-Egresitz, Kara Scannell, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The House is scheduled to vote Tuesday to force the release of records amassed by federal prosecutors during the sex trafficking investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice  Ghislaine Maxwell .\n \n\n   \n  The question of what is actually in those pages — and whether the public will ever see all of those documents — has become a headache for President Donald Trump and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  On November 12, the House Oversight Committee released  20,000 more pages  of records it received from Epstein’s estate, including emails in which Epstein insulted Trump and appeared to coordinate his response with Maxwell to a lawsuit brought by accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The documents were released just hours before the swearing in of  Adelita Grijalva  as the House’s newest Democrat, which had been long delayed amid the government shutdown. Immediately after being sworn in, Grijalva became the decisive 218th member in support of the effort to force the House to vote on the release of this different set of documents — all of the Epstein documents that the Justice Department has access to.\n \n\n   \n  The vote is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, but that alone won’t trigger the release of the documents. If the measure passes, it will still face an uncertain future in the Senate — even after Trump reversed his previous position Sunday and publicly urged for the release of the documents.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, though — six years after Epstein died in his New York prison cell — the public has gotten its hands on many records related to the disgraced financier and his alleged child sex trafficking ring.\n \n\n   \n  Some documents have come from the criminal trial and case file of Maxwell, Epstein’s onetime girlfriend. Some, like those in Wednesday’s release, came from Epstein’s estate, which provided the records to the House Oversight Committee in response to a subpoena.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what new information, if any, is stuffed in the boxes of evidence within the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Some of it, such as records that detail the physical and sexual abuse of women and girls, may never be released.\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein files are made of over 300 gigabytes of data, paper, video, photographs, and audio that live within the FBI’s main electronic case management system, “Sentinel.” These records would include investigative reports and records from the FBI Miami field division’s original Epstein investigation. The bulk of the records would come from the second investigation carried out by the FBI’s New York Office, including memorandums about the investigation and potential targets, locations to be searched, records to be subpoenaed, and hundreds of pages of “302s,” which are the forms that FBI agents use to memorialize what witnesses, victims and suspects said in interviews with investigators.\n \n\n   \n  The case has continued to fascinate the public, years after Epstein’s death, due to his ties to powerful people. Politicians, including Trump, and celebrities have been publicly linked to Epstein for years — sometimes by appearing in flight logs or at events — and all have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death by suicide before trial launched conspiracy theories and deprived many of his accusers a public airing of his conduct. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking minors following a four-week trial in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, after the most recent release of estate records Wednesday, announced he was asking Attorney General Pam Bondi  to investigate Epstein’s ties  to many other high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman — as well as the bank JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later announced on X that  Jay Clayton , the US attorney in Manhattan, will lead the federal investigation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether opening a new criminal investigation would prevent the release of the highly anticipated Justice Department records.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we do and don’t know about the Epstein records:\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department had asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal cases. Former federal prosecutors say the transcripts likely contain a miniscule amount of evidence from the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York generally call law enforcement agents to testify before the grand jury to present just enough evidence they need to support an indictment. Other witnesses, including accusers, are rarely called in to testify before federal grand juries in New York.\n \n\n   \n  The judges overseeing the two cases in New York asked DOJ for more legal argument for why they should unseal grand jury material, which is rarely done. In August, two federal judges in New York  declined Justice Department requests  to unseal grand jury information in Epstein and Maxwell’s cases.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Florida also denied DOJ’s request to unseal grand jury transcripts from its 2005 and 2007 investigations into Epstein, stating the department didn’t meet the legal hurdle to do so under the rules governing the circuit.\n \n\n   \n    Search warrants\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors and the FBI obtained a trove of information during the searches of Epstein’s homes in Florida, New York and Little Saint James, Epstein’s private Caribbean island. That information is under the control of DOJ and is not blocked from public release by secrecy rules.\n \n\n   \n  FBI officials recovered thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females, including at least of one minor, in a search of his Manhattan mansion in the days following his arrest. Binders of CDs containing the photos were seized. Agents used a saw to open a safe that had more than $70,000 in cash, 48 loose diamond stones, one as large as 2.38 carats, and a large diamond ring.\n \n\n   \n  They also collected documents from the New York home, including notes, messages with names and contact information for certain victims, and phone records.\n \n\n   \n  A search of Epstein’s private island was conducted days after he was found dead in a jail cell about one month after his arrest. By then the investigation had shifted its focus to any co-conspirators of Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  In February the Justice Department provided an  index  of evidence it has. The index includes over two dozen computers, numerous hard drives, at least two cell phones, and four iPads. The index says there are boat trip logs potentially of who traveled to his private island — that information has not been made public.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department does not release child pornography so those records would not be expected to be made public under any circumstance.\n \n\n   \n    Florida DOJ case file\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York obtained the investigative record from the earlier investigations into Epstein conducted by their counterparts in Florida in 2007 and 2009. Any of those records that were not covered by grand jury secrecy rules could be released.\n \n\n   \n    Civil lawsuits\n \n\n   \n  Much of the public record relating to Epstein has derived from civil lawsuits brought by accusers, some filed under their own names and others using Jane Doe pseudonyms. Judges have  ordered  the release of thousands of pages of documents, including depositions taken under oath.\n \n\n   \n  Among the famous names referenced in those  documents  are Trump, Clinton, Britain’s Prince Andrew, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, French modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, American investor Glenn Dubin, and Leslie Wexner, the CEO of L Brands. Not all of them were accused of wrongdoing, and all of them have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n    Maxwell trial\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s four-week criminal trial was a public airing of her close relationship to Epstein and her role recruiting, grooming and at times participating in the sexual abuse of minors with Epstein. Four women testified about being sexually assaulted when they were minors.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s former pilot  testified  and identified people he saw on Epstein’s plane, including Trump, former Sens. John Glenn and George Mitchell, Prince Andrew, actor Kevin Spacey, and violinist Itzhak Perlman. The pilot said he never saw any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Gawker first published a copy in 2015 of Epstein’s so-called black book with names and phone numbers of his contacts. The Justice Department released a redacted version of it earlier this year as well as copies of the flight logs that were made public during Maxwell’s criminal trial.\n \n\n   \n  The release was criticized by some of Trump’s supporters because the information was already public — and did nothing to answer lingering questions.\n \n\n   \n    The estate\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee released about 20,000 pages of documents it received from Epstein’s estate through a subpoena — materials the Department of Justice said it didn’t previously have access to.\n \n\n   \n  The documents included emails sent by Epstein. In one dated April 2, 2011, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. REDACTED spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” GOP members of the House Oversight Committee  identified  the person as Giuffre. In one January 2019 email, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff: “trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” The emails also showed an apparent effort between Epstein and Maxwell to coordinate how they would respond to a lawsuit from Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday was the second time that the House Oversight Committee released documents from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee put out a tranche of records, including a reported collection of birthday letters gifted to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The panel has been investigating the case and  had subpoenaed  the estate for documents as part of its probe.\n \n\n   \n  In a  social media exchange  last week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that law enforcement did not have access to the estate documents at the time of his interview with Maxwell this summer.\n \n\n   \n   A version of this story originally published in July 2025.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/china/china-lending-us-biggest-recipient-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"04:05:00-04:05","title":"In China’s global lending spree, the US has been the biggest beneficiary, study finds","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new report by AidData reveals that China, as the world’s largest official creditor, has lent over $2.2 trillion globally between 2000 and 2023, with the United States being the top recipient — receiving over $200 billion across nearly 2,500 projects.

EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Washington has spent years warning countries about the dangers of accepting Chinese loans. But over the past two decades the United States has been the largest recipient globally.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the finding of a new report by AidData, a research lab at William & Mary university in Virginia, which has compiled the most expansive public database to date on China’s overseas lending activities.\n \n\n   \n  The findings, released Tuesday, reveal that government or majority state-owned Chinese entities loaned or granted $2.2 trillion of aid and credit spread across more than 200 countries between 2000 and 2023.\n \n\n   \n  And at the top of that list of recipients is the US – a finding that the researchers say stands counter to a common assumption that Chinese financing has mainly poured into developing nations, for example under the auspices of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s flagship infrastructure drive the Belt and Road Initiative.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, more than three-quarters of China’s overseas lending operations now back projects and activities in upper-middle income and high-income countries, AidData found – and has been used on critical infrastructure, critical minerals, and the acquisition of high-tech assets critical to China’s national security goals.\n \n\n   \n  “The US and its allies in the wealthy, industrialized world have allowed Chinese state-owned creditors to finance critical infrastructure assets within their own jurisdictions. They’ve allowed them to finance the acquisition of critical minerals within their jurisdictional boundaries. They’ve allowed Chinese companies to use loans to buy their technological crown jewels,” AidData executive director Bradley Parks told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For the better part of the last decade, Washington has been warning countries that, in its view, Beijing is a predatory lender that will take control of another country’s assets if those loans fall into distress, Parks added.\n \n\n   \n  The world’s second largest economy has emerged as the world’s largest official creditor as it vied to position itself as the go-to financial ally for developing countries. Along the way it also came in for significant criticism that its practices saddled countries with unsustainable debt – a charge Beijing denies. Some  analysts  have also pushed back against the debt-trap narrative.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the latest AidData shows that the US, as the top of the recipient of Chinese official sector financing, has received more than $200 billion for nearly 2,500 projects and activities that can be found in nearly every state in the country.\n \n\n   \n  More than half that credit was in the form of liquidity support to corporations, a kind of financing where Chinese creditors – often as one entity in a syndicate of many international financial institutions – act as a credit line for major companies that need cash.\n \n\n   \n  Such transactions are a common corporate practice and way for banks to make money – and they would not give Chinese firms a stake in companies or control over the borrowers, which have included Fortune 500 companies.\n \n\n   \n  But Chinese state-owned entities have also financed the acquisition of US high-tech companies and bankrolled infrastructure including LNG projects, energy pipelines, power transmission lines and airport terminals since 2000, the researchers found.\n \n\n   \n  Transactions involving sensitive sectors have become increasingly difficult in the US in recent years as regulatory scrutiny tightened amid growing concern in Washington about the national security implications of China’s financial stake in America. Chinese entities have looked to other high-income nations with less robust checks, AidData found.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom has received $60 billion and EU member states $161 billion over the 24-year study period, according to AidData.\n \n\n   \n  Like with the US, there has also been increased scrutiny and warnings in Britain and Europe over the levels of Chinese investment, particularly in critical infrastructure, in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not claiming and we don’t believe that all of this lending to the US serves some sort of grand geopolitical or geoeconomic strategy – some of it is really just about the pursuit of profit … China’s financial sector is just dominated by the state,” said Parks.\n \n\n   \n  However, he added, judging which transactions are “benign and (which) are not” constitutes a key challenge for regulators and national security officials.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Aligned with the policy’\n \n\n   \n  AidData researchers found “increasing alignment between China’s cross-border lending activities and the policy priorities of the party-state, including those related to national security and economic statecraft,” the team said in their report.\n \n\n   \n  In particular, the “Made In China 2025” initiative appeared linked to shifting priorities in outbound lending, according to the findings. The government plan, released in 2015, was meant to spur China’s development in advanced technologies, especially in high priority sectors that included robotics and automation, aerospace, and computing.\n \n\n   \n  “You see this rapid ramp up in cross-border acquisition lending that is aligned with that policy, and (Chinese entities) start lending for the 10 sectors that were that were identified in Made in China 2025,” said Parks.\n \n\n   \n  That enabled Chinese firms to acquire strategically significant assets using state capital to fill the gap in their own funds, according to Parks, who noted there is “no real analog” to that kind of practice in wealthy industrialized countries.\n \n\n   \n  Examples cited in the report of such high-tech company acquisitions in the US over the past two decades include semiconductor firm OmniVision Technologies, automation firm the Paslin Company and electronics company Ingram Micro, which was subsequently bought by an American private equity firm after the earlier acquisition.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese state-owned creditors have also played a role in Beijing’s access around the world to critical minerals needed for high-tech goods, approving over 100 loan commitments worth $14 billion for overseas critical mineral operations between 2021 and 2023 globally.\n \n\n   \n  As Beijing focused on strategic sectors and its banks became creditors to wealthy Western firms, the overall share of overseas lending and grant-giving that supports low-income and lower-middle income countries has also fallen. Once accounting for some 88% of those activities in 2000, they now account for 24%, according to the findings.\n \n\n   \n  Another shift, according to Parks, has been how Western governments are looking at the Chinese government’s strategy.\n \n\n   \n  China’s rivals in the G7 are responding by making major adjustments that were once inconceivable—for example, slashing overseas development aid budgets, dismantling foreign aid agencies, ramping up cross-border lending on non-concessional terms, and taking equity stakes in critical infrastructure assets overseas, the report found.\n \n\n   \n  The US under the second Trump administration has imposed massive cuts to America’s international aid program, but there are efforts in Washington to vastly expand the budget of the US International Development Finance Corporation and its ability to disburse loans in high-income countries.\n \n\n   \n  Not long ago, according to Parks, “Beijing’s approach to international lending and grant-giving was a source of scorn or ridicule … it just was not a source of inspiration or emulation for policymakers in the G7, and now everything is turned upside down – now the US and its allies are really focused on competing with China on its terms.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/trump-venezuela-strike-decision","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-13:30","title":"Trump hints at diplomatic window with Maduro but muses about hitting drug facilities in other countries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has expressed openness to diplomatic talks with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, suggesting a potential pathway for resolving tensions without immediate military action.

      \n  By Kevin Liptak, Alayna Treene, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:21 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  has yet to make a decision on whether to attack  Venezuela  on land, a White House official and a senior US official said, as he hints a window may be opening for diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday he would be open to speaking directly with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro at a “certain time,” suggesting he sees a pathway in the country that doesn’t involve dropping bombs or sending commandos to take Maduro out.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, Trump made clear his willingness to go after drug operations on land using military force — including, he said, in Mexico and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  “We know their address. We know their address. We know everything about every one of them,” he said of drug cartel leaders, adding he would be “proud” to strike drug facilities in other countries in his attempt to prevent the substances from reaching the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs?” he said. “That’s OK with me.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Venezuela, Trump declined to rule out sending US troops, saying he doesn’t “rule out anything.”\n \n\n   \n  But as American military forces amass in the region — including the most advanced US aircraft carrier and 15,000 personnel — Trump is hoping the pressure is enough to force Maduro to step down without taking direct military action, the US official said.\n \n\n   \n  “Yeah, I probably would talk to him,” Trump said Monday when asked whether he’d speak with his Venezuelan counterpart before ordering strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro suggested Monday night that he would be open to dialogue with his American counterpart.\n \n\n   \n  “Anyone who wants to talk to Venezuela will talk face to face,” Maduro said on state TV when asked to respond to Trump’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “We reaffirm that only through diplomacy should free countries and governments understand each other, and only through dialogue should they seek common ground on issues of mutual interest,” the Venezuelan leader said.\n \n\n   \n  Potential talks between Trump and Maduro are still very preliminary, a senior White House official told CNN. Maduro and his associates have reached out through multiple channels with a desire to open a line of communication.\n \n\n   \n  Even though Trump has expressed interest in he or his administration potentially holding those talks, it was not immediately clear who might be a part of those conversations. Initially, Richard Grenell, a special presidential envoy, had been leading negotiations with top Venezuelan officials before Trump instructed him to end all diplomatic outreach last month.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s interest in potentially reopening diplomatic communications comes as the US military has continued to grow its presence near the South American country.\n \n\n   \n  Trump received briefings on military options on three consecutive days last week. The options ranged in intensity, from strikes on military or government facilities to special operations raids. The option of doing nothing also still exists.\n \n\n   \n  The president has, at points, voiced some reservations about taking direct military action inside Venezuela. He’s questioned the risks posed for US troops and asked about the likelihood of success.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is also attuned to fresh criticism from some of his allies that his attention is overly focused abroad, rather than on domestic matters.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t immediately clear what signals the administration had received that Maduro was prepared for a fresh round of diplomacy. Last month, amid quiet efforts at brokering an agreement with Caracas, Trump instructed his team to cut off diplomatic outreach to Maduro and top Venezuelan officials.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Trump and senior officials were frustrated Maduro wasn’t agreeing to step down voluntarily. On Monday, David Smolansky, an advisor to Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto that the mounting U.S. pressure was weakening Maduro’s hold on power.\n \n\n   \n  “They are cracking. Actually, they are cracking. And there is a lot of tensions and mistrust among themselves, not only because of the operation that is in the Caribbean,” Smolansky said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kristen Holmes, Katrina Samaan and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with remarks from President Donald Trump.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/stand-your-ground-laws-limits-states","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Indiana fatal shooting renews questions about stand-your-ground laws and their limits","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A house cleaner in Indiana was fatally shot after mistakenly arriving at the wrong home, sparking renewed national debate over the limits and appropriate application of stand-your-ground laws.

questions about stand-your-ground laws and their limits. Here’s what to know \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Maria Florinda Rios Perez De Velasquez’s mistaken arrival at the wrong Indiana address Wednesday  cost her her life . As the house cleaner tried to enter the home she thought was scheduled for housekeeping that morning, the homeowner fatally shot her.\n \n\n   \n  The incident is renewing questions about so-called stand-your-ground laws that can empower individuals to defend themselves, even with deadly force, if they feel threatened or in danger. But the statutes are very specific and the extent of their protection varies by state.\n \n\n   \n  Under  Indiana law , individuals may use reasonable force — including deadly force — to stop a person from unlawfully trying to enter their property. But  prosecutors say  the statute doesn’t apply to the homeowner’s actions Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know about stand-your-ground laws.\n \n\n   \n    Stand-your-ground laws can empower homeowners against intruders\n \n\n   \n  Generally, stand-your-ground laws and “castle doctrines” can allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be.\n \n\n   \n  The “castle doctrine” is the legal notion that your home is your castle, and you have the right to use lethal force to defend your home and not retreat. A number of states have enshrined the castle doctrine in statutory law, sometimes with slightly different guidelines for when deadly force can be used.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast, stand-your-ground laws and policies say even when a person is outside their home, they can stay where they are without retreating, even if they can avoid the danger by retreating, according to University of California, Los Angeles, law professor Eugene Volokh.\n \n\n   \n  These statutes deal with a very specific question, according to Volokh: If someone reasonably fears death, serious bodily injury, etc., but can avoid the danger with complete safety by retreating, can that person still stay where they are and use deadly force?\n \n\n   \n  “They allow people to respond to threats of death, serious bodily injury, rape, and some other serious crimes with deadly force,” Volokh told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, you “generally can’t use deadly force for self-defense in most states unless you reasonably believe that you’re facing the risk of death or serious bodily injury or some serious crime: rape, kidnapping or, in some states, robbery, burglary, or arson,”  Volokh previously wrote  on the subject.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of the laws, including the National Rifle Association, say they give people the right to protect themselves, no matter where they are. Critics say the laws encourage violence and allow for  legal racial bias .\n \n\n   \n    Most states have some version of the self-defense laws\n \n\n   \n  The count of states with stand-your-ground doctrines depends on the criteria used to define them, because states word and even enforce the statutes differently.\n \n\n   \n  At least 31 states, Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands recognize that “there is no duty to retreat in any place in which one is lawfully present or has the right to be,” according to the  National Conference of State Legislatures . Arkansas and Ohio became the latest states to enact the legislation in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In eight states — California, Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Virginia, Vermont and Washington — that don’t have stand-your-ground laws, courts and jury instructions can allow people to use deadly force to defend themselves if they believe they are in serious danger, according to the NCSL.\n \n\n   \n  At least 23 states have laws to protect people from being sued for damages by the person they defended themselves against, the NCSL says. Six states tip the scales in the other direction, allowing even a person who wasn’t charged with a crime or found to have acted in self-defense to be sued in civil court: Hawaii, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota and Tennessee.\n \n\n   \n  The law has long been used in legal battles across the country\n \n\n   \n  In Florida, where the first stand-your-ground law was passed in 2005, it was used in the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who fatally shot  17-year-old Trayvon Martin  in 2012 while he was walking home from a convenience store. Zimmerman’s supporters said he was exercising his Second Amendment right to bear arms and  Florida’s stand-your-ground law  gave him immunity.\n \n\n   \n  Florida’s law allows people to meet “force with force” if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. Under the law, a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity, is being attacked in a place he has a right to be, and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else.\n \n\n   \n  In Texas,  jurors were allowed to consider  the “castle doctrine” in the 2018 murder case against Amber Guyger, the former Dallas police officer who said she mistakenly entered the wrong apartment and killed Botham Jean, a 26-year-old man. In October 2019, a jury ultimately found  Guyger guilty of murdering  Jean and sentenced her to 10 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  And more recently in Texas, after an 11-year-old playing “ding-dong-ditch” was  fatally shot as he ran  from a home whose doorbell he playfully rang in August, prosecutors were quick to deny that the state’s self-defense legislation was relevant. “The castle doctrine does not apply in any way, shape or form to an 11-year-old boy running down the street,” police previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Texas law says a person can use force as a means of self-defense if they reasonably believe the force is immediately necessary to protect them against another’s use or attempted use of force. The state has “one of the strongest ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws,”  according to  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/asia/thailand-monkey-trafficking-cambodia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"03:01:00Z","title":"Monkeys, meth and mesh bags: Thai police arrest two for alleged animal trafficking","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thai police have arrested two Thai nationals for allegedly smuggling 81 long-tailed macaques in blue mesh bags across the Cambodian border, with another 62 macaques discovered in a sugarcane field in Khlong Hat District.

methamphetamine, authorities said, in one of two cases that saw 143 monkeys rescued from suspected wildlife smugglers in a single day.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand is an international hub for wildlife trafficking, one of the world’s biggest illegal trades estimated to be worth between $7.8 and $10 billion per year,  according to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \n \n\n   \n  In the first case, rangers were patrolling in southeast Thailand’s Khlong Hat District, near the border with Cambodia, when they heard “unusual animal noises” coming from a sugarcane field, according to a press release from Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation (DNP).\n \n\n   \n  After checking the area, the authorities found 10 plastic baskets hidden in the sugarcane containing 62 long-tailed macaques, a monkey native to Southeast Asia   which is widely used in drug development because its DNA closely mirrors that of humans.\n \n\n   \n  There is also a thriving black market for the species, which is considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n \n\n   \n  The monkeys – 44 males and 18 females – were bound inside blue nylon mesh bags, according to the press release.\n \n\n   \n  The monkeys were in a weakened state and were transferred to a local wildlife rescue center.\n \n\n   \n  Later that afternoon, rangers were patrolling in neighboring Aranyaprathet District when they spotted two men unloading blue mesh bags from a pickup truck on a country road near the Cambodian border, the DNP said.\n \n\n   \n  After a car chase, police arrested two male suspects, who they identified as Thai nationals.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the car they found 81 long-tailed macaques – 30 males, 51 females – tightly packed in mesh bags, as well as methamphetamine, according to the release. The monkeys were also transferred to the wildlife rescue center for treatment.\n \n\n   \n  The suspects are facing offenses related to possessing and trading protected wildlife without permission, as well as charges for possessing and consuming illicit drugs, the DNP release said.\n \n\n   \n  According to a police statement, the suspects in the second case said they were hired to smuggle the monkeys into Cambodia.\n \n\n   \n  “The discovery of consecutive cases like this confirms that the border area remains a target for wildlife trafficking networks, especially for long-tailed macaques, which are in high demand internationally,” said Somruek Suppamitkrisana, Director of the Wildlife Conservation Division.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Thai police arrested a man after he was found with  two baby orangutans  in a basket at a gas station in Bangkok.\n \n\n   \n  Last November, Thailand repatriated home to Myanmar  almost 1,000 highly endangered tortoises and lemurs , which they recovered during an anti-trafficking operation.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024,  an endangered red panda  was found alongside 86 other animals inside luggage at Bangkok airport, bound for Mumbai, customs authorities said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/australia/australia-vegemite-prisoner-sues-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Murderer sues for right to eat Vegemite in Australian prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A convicted murderer, Andre McKechnie, is suing the Victorian government in the Supreme Court of Victoria, claiming that the ban on Vegemite in prisons since 2006 breaches his human right to 'enjoy his culture as an Australian' under the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act.

He is suing Victoria’s Department of Justice and Community Safety and the agency that manages the prisons, Corrections Victoria. The case is scheduled for trial next year.\n \n\n   \n  McKechnie is seeking a court declaration that the defendants denied him his right under the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act to “enjoy his culture as an Australian.”\n \n\n   \n  He also wants a declaration that the defendants breached the Corrections Act by “failing to provide food adequate to maintain” McKechnie’s “well-being.”\n \n\n   \n  He wants the court to order the decision to ban Vegemite to be “remade in accordance with the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Vegemite has been banned from Victorian prisons since 2006, with Corrections Victoria saying it “interferes with narcotic detection dogs.”\n \n\n   \n  Inmates used to smear packages of illicit drugs with Vegemite in the hope that the odor would distract the dogs from the contraband.\n \n\n   \n  Vegemite also contains yeast, which is banned from Victorian prisons because of its “potential to be used in the production of alcohol,” the contraband list says.\n \n\n   \n  Manufactured in Australia since 1923 as an alternative to Britain’s Marmite, Vegemite was long marketed as a source of vitamin B for growing children.\n \n\n   \n  The spread is beloved by a majority of Australians, but typically considered an acquired taste at best by those who weren’t raised on it.\n \n\n   \n  The last US president to visit Australia, Barack Obama, once said: “It’s horrible.”\n \n\n   \n  Australian band Men at Work aroused international curiosity about the yeast-based spread when they mentioned a “Vegemite sandwich” in their 1980s hit “Down Under.”\n \n\n   \n  The band’s lead singer Colin Hay once accused American critics of laying Vegemite on too thick, blaming a “more is more” US culture.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a favorite on breakfast toast and in cheese sandwiches, with most fans agreeing it’s best applied sparingly. Australian travelers bemoan Vegemite’s scarcity overseas.\n \n\n   \n  The Australian government intervened in April when Canadian officials temporarily prevented a Toronto-based cafe from selling Vegemite in jars and on toast in a dispute media branded as “Vegemite-gate.” Canadians relented and allowed the product to be sold despite its failure to comply with local regulations dealing with food packaging and vitamin fortification.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice and Community Safety and Corrections Victoria declined to comment on Tuesday. Government agencies generally maintain it is not appropriate to comment on issues that are before the courts.\n \n\n   \n  Victims of crime advocate and lawyer John Herron said it was a frivolous lawsuit and was offensive to victims’ families.\n \n\n   \n  “As victims, we don’t have any rights. We have limited if any support. It’s always about the perpetrator, and this just reinforces that,” said Herron, whose daughter Courtney Herron, was beaten to death in a Melbourne park in 2019. Her killer was found not guilty of murder by reason of mental impairment.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a case of Vegemite or Nutella or whatever it may be. It’s an extra perk that is rubbing our faces in the tragedy that we’ve suffered,” Herron added.\n \n\n   \n  McKechnie is currently held at maximum-security Port Phillip Prison. He was 23 years old when he stabbed to death wealthy Gold Coast property developer Otto Kuhne in Queensland state in 1994.\n \n\n   \n  He was sentenced to life for murder and transferred a decade later from the Queensland to the Victorian prison system.\n \n\n   \n  He wrote last year that he spent eight years free on parole in Victoria before he “decided that I had had enough.” He returned to prison and has spent the past decade in custody.\n \n\n   \n  McKechnie’s lawyers didn’t respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/asia/taiwan-handbook-china-invasion-disasters-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Taiwan rolls out handbook on how to prepare for natural disasters – and a Chinese invasion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Taiwan has released a public handbook to prepare its 23 million residents for both natural disasters and a potential military invasion by China.

Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Taiwan’s 23 million inhabitants will receive a booklet this week on how to survive natural disasters and emergencies, as well as an invasion by China, the island’s Defense Ministry announced Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The handbook, unveiled in September, includes guidelines on what supplies to stockpile in households and put in go-bags, and instructions on what to do when encountering enemy soldiers.\n \n\n   \n  In the event of a military invasion, “any claims that the government has surrendered or that the nation has been defeated is false,” the booklet says.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan is a self-ruling democracy but is viewed by China as its own territory. Beijing has vowed to seize it one day – by force if necessary. Under leader Xi Jinping, China has intensified military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan, and regularly sends fighter jets and warships around the island.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan’s book comes after Sweden and Finland earlier this year updated guidance to their citizens on how to survive war, as  NATO allies  bolster defense measures against the backdrop of the  Ukraine conflict .\n \n\n   \n  “Given natural disasters such as typhoons and the military threat from China, we want our people to understand that the more prepared we are, the safer we will be,” director of the Taiwanese military’s All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency Shen Wei-chih said in a press briefing.\n \n\n   \n  The handbook recommends keeping a one-week supply of household supplies including noodles and rice ,  and leaving go-bag equipped with a compact sleeping bag by the door in case of emergencies.\n \n\n   \n  It also outlined the types of military threats Taiwan could face, from sabotage of undersea cables, unilateral declaration of no-fly zones, to an all-out invasion.\n \n\n   \n  As civilians may have difficulty telling the difference between friends and foes, the handbook advises civilians to leave as quickly as possible if they spot military activity in the vicinity. It also asks citizens not to take photos and videos of Taiwan’s own military movements to ensure operational integrity.\n \n\n   \n  The handbook also cautions against cybersecurity risks of Chinese-made mobile applications like DeepSeek, WeChat, TikTok and RedNote, and potential privacy intrusions by some Chinese-brand devices with cameras, stating that they could “even be used by the enemy in a crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  The Defense Ministry said it will print around 11 million copies – including 105,000 English versions for foreign consulates, media and residents in Taiwan – to reach around 9.8 million households in Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Distribution of the booklet will begin this week and wrap up by January next year, the ministry added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/investing/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00-05:00","title":"Stocks and Bitcoin Slide as Nerves Fray Ahead of Nvidia Earnings","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wall Street experienced a sharp downturn on November 18, 2025, as investors grew fearful ahead of two major events: Nvidia's earnings report and the delayed September jobs report.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Wall Street kicked off the week on a sour note, with stocks and bitcoin tumbling as a risk-off attitude spread through markets.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow closed lower by 557 points, or 1.18%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.92%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.84%.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 13%.  CNN’s Fear and Greed index  traded in “extreme fear” and hit its lowest level since early April.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks fell on Monday as investors’ nerves intensified ahead of two key events this week: Nvidia ( NVDA ), the star of the artificial intelligence boom, is set to report earnings on Wednesday. And on Thursday, the September jobs report — long delayed because of the government shutdown — is set to be released.\n \n\n   \n  These two events will provide more insight about the issues that are “top of mind” for Wall Street, according to José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n \n\n   \n  Tech stocks have  come under pressure  this month as concerns linger about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 5.5% since hitting a record high in late October.\n \n\n   \n  Investors are trying to discern whether the AI trade is on stable foundations, and whether the Federal Reserve will pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting in December.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, bitcoin plunged on Monday to below $90,000 for the first time in seven mon﻿ths, erasing its gains for this year. The cryptocurrency has tanked more than 28% in just six weeks after it hit a record high above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n  Tech and crypto-related stocks led the S&P 500 lower on Monday. Coinbase ( COIN ), a crypto exchange, fell 7%.\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Monday dipped below their 50-day moving averages, according to FactSet. The 50-day moving average is a key threshold of support.\n \n\n   \n  “While the long-term uptrend is intact, we believe a corrective pullback/consolidation phase is already underway after the market’s six-month winning streak,” Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said in a note.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks are coming off a  volatile week . Tech stocks took a bruising last week before investors swooped in on Friday to buy the dip.\n \n\n   \n  Investors this week are gearing up for a potential market-moving event with Nvidia’s earnings. The chipmaker accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500’s market value. Nvidia shares fell 1.83% on Monday, weighing on the broader market.\n \n\n   \n  “The monthly jobs report would normally dominate this week’s economic calendar, but with the AI trade struggling the past couple of weeks, Nvidia’s earnings are once again looking like a key piece of the market’s momentum puzzle,” Chris Larkin, managing director at Morgan Stanley’s E-Trade, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The recent stock market rally is also being tested as investors adjust to the prospect that the Fed might pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting next month. Traders are pricing in a 45% chance that the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 94% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks have rallied on optimism about Fed rate cuts. Nerves are mounting that the central bank may prioritize concerns about stubborn inflation.\n \n\n   \n  “Data releases starting this week should provide a clearer picture for one of the key risks over the coming weeks — the December Fed meeting,” Mohit Kumar, chief strategist and economist for Europe at Jefferies, said in a note.\n \n\n   \n  Investors this month have also rotated out of high-flying tech stocks and moved into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.\n \n\n   \n  “This rotation is both expected and welcome, as it should unwind some of the frothiness … and allow this bull market the opportunity to catch its breath before resuming its advance,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said in a note.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/entertainment/wicked-for-good-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande","dateOfPublication":"1224-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00-05:00","title":"Ariana Grande Steps In to Support Cynthia Erivo at 'Wicked: For Good' Premiere Amid Voice Concerns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the 'Wicked: For Good' premiere in New York City on November 18, 2025, Cynthia Erivo, who had lost her voice, received support from Ariana Grande during a live E! livestream interview.

She has to rest her voice!”\n \n\n   \n  As Erivo looked on smiling, Grande went on to comment on the pair’s joint Grammy nomination – they are  nominated for best pop duo/group performance  for “Defying Gravity” at next year’s music awards – as well as Erivo’s upcoming solo album and book titled “Simply More.”\n \n\n   \n  “Am I doing OK?” Grande asked Erivo jokingly as she plugged her costar’s projects. Erivo nodded, laughing.\n \n\n   \n  When they were asked about the emotions they’re feeling as the conclusion to  last year’s Oz-set film  approaches, Grande said she assumed they were experiencing the same thing – “overwhelming gratitude.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been such an incredible ride and an incredible experience to create with people we love so much and respect so much creatively, but also who just have such great hearts,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The “Yes, And” singer added that they are excited for the public to “finally be able to get the full story, the full arc of these women that we love so much, and have spent these years with.”\n \n\n   \n  At that point, Erivo leaned in to whisper something to Grande, but she had trouble hearing her. So Erivo briefly spoke into the mic in a raspy voice.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really beautiful that we’re finishing here, where it started,” she said, referencing New York City, which is home to the Gershwin theater, where the Tony-winning “Wicked” musical debuted in 2003 and is still playing on Broadway.\n \n\n   \n  The stars of the film have had an  action-packed  press tour to say the least.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier on Monday, an Australian serial intruder who accosted Grande during the “Wicked: For Good” premiere in Singapore was sentenced to 9 days in jail for being a public nuisance.\n \n\n   \n  Grande and Erivo, who play Glinda and Elphaba, did not speak about the incident at the New York premiere, but Grande referenced the taxing press tour.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s only so much the human body can endure,” she said, assuring viewers that Erivo was “throat-coating.”\n \n\n   \n  “Wicked: For Good” flies into theaters on Friday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/middleeast/palestinian-prisoner-deaths-physicians-human-rights-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:08:00-05:00","title":"At least 98 Palestinians died in Israeli prisons in two years, Israeli human rights group finds","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new report by Physicians for Human Rights - Israel (PHRI) reveals that at least 98 Palestinians died in Israeli custody between October 2023 and November 2025, with the true number likely much higher due to missing detainees from Gaza.

Israel (PHRI) is based on official Israeli records and data obtained through freedom of information requests, which it cross-referenced with forensic reports, interviews with family members and lawyers, testimonies from detained Palestinians, information published by other human rights groups and other individual inquiries to locate specific detained persons.\n \n\n   \n  Palestinians died in custody from physical violence, medical neglect or both, according to PHRI, an Israeli advocacy group made up of medical professionals and human rights activists.\n \n\n   \n  PHRI found that 46 Palestinians died in the custody of the Israel Prison Service since the outbreak of the war and that at least 52 Palestinians — all from Gaza — died in Israeli military custody.\n \n\n   \n  “The fate of hundreds of Palestinians from Gaza detained by the Israeli military remains unknown to this day, suggesting that the true number of deaths is likely significantly higher than those documented here,” the PHRI report noted.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli authorities stopped providing information to the Red Cross regarding Palestinians in custody in the early days of the war and barred access to detention facilities.\n \n\n   \n  The last publicly available data that the Israeli military provided on deaths in detention was from May 2024, and the Israel Prison Service’s last provided data was from September 2024. After that, PHRI was able to document additional deaths using information from firsthand testimonies and official responses to requests submitted by the Palestinian Authority.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the allegations in the report, the Israel Prison Service (IPS) told CNN it “operates in accordance with the law” and that “all inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care, hygiene and adequate living conditions are upheld by professionally trained staff.” It added that it does not comment on figures or allegations presented by outside organizations.\n \n\n   \n  “The claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented,” the IPS said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Unprecedented’ number of deaths\n \n\n   \n  “The unprecedented number of Palestinians who have died in Israeli custody over the past two years, together with clear evidence of deaths caused by torture and medical neglect, points to a deliberate Israeli policy of killing Palestinians while in detention,” Oneg Ben Dror, the project coordinator for PHRI’s prisoners and detainees department, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “These findings — and the ongoing failure of Israeli law enforcement to prosecute those responsible — turn Israeli law itself into a fig leaf and a tool for concealment,” Ben Dror added.\n \n\n   \n  The report provides details on the deaths of Palestinians classified as “security prisoners,” which includes detainees held without charge or without trial.\n \n\n   \n  While the identities of some of those who died in Israeli custody remain unknown, the report identified 73 of the Palestinians who died. Those named in the report include  Dr. Adnan al-Bursh , 53, who was the head of orthopedics at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza and died after reported signs of “physical abuse” in prison, according to testimony from a fellow detainee who has since been released. The report also named 17-year-old  Walid Khalid Ahmad , who died following prolonged malnutrition, according to an autopsy report.\n \n\n   \n  PHRI concluded in the report that Israeli authorities have waged an “unprecedented assault on detained Palestinians,” arguing that Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, took steps to “deliberately worsen conditions of Palestinians in Israeli prisons.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Israeli Ministry of National Security for a response.\n \n\n   \n  Ben-Gvir previously advocated for the minimum conditions by law and said that “the conditions in prison add deterrence.” He also lashed out at the Israeli Supreme Court in September after it ruled that the state was not providing adequate food to Palestinian prisoners and must improve their nutrition.\n \n\n   \n  Deaths occurred at nearly all Israeli prison facilities, which the report said “further underscores the systematic and ongoing nature of these killings in Israeli custody.”\n \n\n   \n  Among those who died in Israeli prison facilities, 17 were from Gaza, 26 were from the occupied West Bank and three held Israeli citizenship, according to the report. The data shows that “on average, two Palestinians died every month in IPS detention facilities, with the number of deaths steadily increasing over time.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has  previously reported on abuse, medical neglect and horrific conditions  at the Sde Teiman field hospital at an Israeli military base that now doubles as a detention center in Israel’s Negev desert.\n \n\n   \n  The PHRI report found that from the start of the war through August of this year, 29 detained Palestinians from Gaza died at Sde Teiman in the custody of the Israeli military, and further deaths were recorded at military camps in southern Israel, Ofer and Anatot.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, PHRI announced it was joining leading Israeli  human rights group B’Tselem  in calling Israel’s actions in Gaza genocide. Israel has strongly rejected the accusations.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/football-nfl-cleveland-shedeur-sanders-home-break-in","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:39:00-11:17","title":"Cleveland rookie Shedeur Sanders’ home broken into during NFL debut, AP source says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During his NFL debut with the Cleveland Browns against the Baltimore Ravens, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders discovered that his home had been burglarized.

James Comey indictment may be tainted by ‘profound investigative missteps’ \n       \n  By Katelyn  Polantz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:18 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge on Monday scorched the Justice Department’s handling of years-old evidence in its case against former FBI Director James Comey, raising the possibility that interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan may have botched the grand jury proceeding and the indictment could be tainted.\n \n\n   \n  “The record points to a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps, missteps that led an FBI agent and a prosecutor to potentially undermine the integrity of the grand jury proceeding,” Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick of the Eastern District of Virginia wrote  in an opinion  released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick’s finding that Comey’s rights may have been violated with the use of the evidence collected in another investigation more than five years ago sets the table for Comey’s team to make a more robust challenge of the indictment and ask the court to dismiss it.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also has raised the stakes for Comey’s potential access to transcripts of Halligan speaking to the grand jury in late September before they approved the indictment. The judge said that Halligan – the only prosecutor to present the case on behalf of the Justice Department – may have misstated the law to the grand jurors in a way that compromised the proceeding.\n \n\n   \n  “Here, the procedural and substantive irregularities that occurred before the grand jury, and the manner in which evidence presented to the grand jury was collected and used, may rise to the level of government misconduct resulting in prejudice to Mr. Comey,” the judge wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Access to evidence from a previous investigation\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick said the Justice Department accessed old evidence it seized in searches of online accounts from Comey’s friend and then-lawyer Daniel Richman, for a prior leak investigation that didn’t result in charges.\n \n\n   \n  The judge said DOJ did so without a new court-approved search warrant. Nor did investigators take time this year to sift out confidential attorney-client communications when it charged Comey at the end of September, knowing some of that evidence might not be able to be used, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “This cavalier attitude towards a basic tenet of the Fourth Amendment and multiple court orders left the government unchecked to rummage through all of the information seized” from the prior investigation of Richman, Fitzpatrick wrote, “and apparently, in the government’s eyes, to do so again anytime they chose.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge had said Comey’s defense team should get access to the grand jury records on Monday, but the Justice Department is still trying to challenge that decision and is holding back the records as another trial-court judge looks at the issues. The Justice Department said in a filing on Monday following Fitzpatrick’s ruling that Comey’s attorney-client confidentiality may not even have been breached by investigators, and that Comey shouldn’t be able to reach beyond grand jury secrecy rules at this point of the case.\n \n\n   \n  The court could move fast to resolve the dispute over whether Comey’s team gets access to the grand jury records as soon as this weekend, with little additional ability in a criminal proceeding.\n \n\n   \n  “These materials are essential if Mr. Comey is to fully and fairly defend himself in the face of the irregularities that have characterized this investigation from its inception,” Fitzpatrick wrote on Monday. “The Court finds that the institutional concerns for grand jury secrecy are greatly outweighed by Mr. Comey’s right to Due Process.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge called the Justice Department’s decision this fall not to seek a new search warrant that would have been court approved to access the old evidence from Richman “inexplicable” and “highly unusual.” He also noted that it was “foreseeable” Richman’s electronic devices might contain attorney-client communications with Comey, and the department had known this for years, even excluding Comey from its evidence processing years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Later Monday evening, Fitzpatrick’s order that would allow Comey’s defense team to access grand jury records was temporarily paused by the federal judge overseeing the entire case.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have until Wednesday to make their argument over court filings to why the order should be dissolved, the federal judge said. Comey’s attorneys will then have until Friday to reply to the objections prosecutors raise.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick also revealed for the first time that an agent had warned others at the FBI about the use of Richman’s data on the same day Comey was indicted in September — just a few days before the window in which the department could bring a case would close.\n \n\n   \n  One of the FBI agents who had been warned of potentially tainted evidence, the judge said, still “proceeded into the grand jury undeterred,” testifying to the grand jurors as the only witness, about evidence from the old searches of Richman.\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury presentation\n \n\n   \n  The judge also slammed statements Halligan made to the grand jury, adding that the prosecutor appears to have made a “fundamental and highly prejudicial misstatement of the law” regarding Comey’s ability to testify at his own trial and about his legal burdens if he were charged. The exact words Halligan said to the grand jury are redacted in the judge’s opinion on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  But Fitzpatrick, who has read the grand jury transcript, said grand jurors seemed to believe Halligan was telling them that Comey would have to answer questions at trial that she couldn’t during the proceeding, where prosecutors privately present the case to the grand jurors. The judge said Halligan implied to the grand jury that Comey may have to testify at his own trial to win his case — even though the Fifth Amendment gives defendants the protection to decline to testify so as not to incriminate themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, the judge noted that Halligan suggested to the grand jury the Justice Department had more and better evidence it could use against Comey later at trial, another potentially problematic statement by the prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s team will be able to ask the court to suppress the use of core evidence in his case or to dismiss charges against him - including because of what Halligan and the FBI agent witness said to the grand jurors by next week.\n \n\n   \n  The case, alleging Comey lied to Congress in 2020 about his interactions with Richman, currently is set to go to trial just after New Year’s Day. A separate judge is weighing whether Halligan has the authority to have secured the indictment against Comey, given that she is not a Senate-confirmed political appointee.\n \n\n   \n    Timing of grand jury hearing\n \n\n   \n  The magistrate judge also raised significant questions about the timing of the grand jury deliberations and two hours for which there is no grand jury transcript, which Halligan has outlined in a sworn statement recently and said tracked with the grand jury’s deliberations, which wouldn’t have been recorded.\n \n\n   \n  “If the prosecutor is mistaken about the time she received notification of the grand jury’s vote on the original indictment, and this procedure did take place, then the transcript and audio recording provided to the Court are incomplete,” Fitzpatrick also wrote. “If this procedure did not take place, then the Court is in uncharted legal territory in that the indictment returned in open court was not the same charging document presented to and deliberated upon by the grand jury.”\n \n\n   \n  “Either way, this unusual series of events, still not fully explained by the prosecutor’s declaration, calls into question the presumption of regularity generally associated with grand jury proceedings, and provides another genuine issue the defense may raise to challenge the manner in which the government obtained the indictment,” Fitzpatrick added.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/trump-mcdonalds-economy-tariffs-rebate-checks-inflation-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s drive-thru affordability speech won’t fix his political woes over the economy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump promoted a narrative of an economic 'golden age' during a speech to McDonald’s franchise owners, citing falling prices and affordability, while celebrating the cultural role of fast food in American life.

Trump’s drive-thru affordability speech won’t fix his political woes over the economy \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump proclaimed an economic golden age under the Golden Arches. But while he may have a regular guy’s taste in fast food, he’s looking oblivious to the wrenching price pressure haunting millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s never been a time like this,” he declared Monday at a summit of McDonald’s franchise owners in Washington. The president waxed lyrical about his favorite Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and fondly recalled his turn  working the fry station  at one of the fast-food giant’s Pennsylvania restaurants last year.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s overall message was jarring, as he argued the economy was super-sized even while millions struggle to afford the cost of living. “You know, I just might add, this is also the golden age of America, because we are doing better than we’ve ever done as a country. Prices are coming down and all of that stuff,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  He went on, “We are looking at affordability — we are going to bring it down for everybody because not everybody understands the fact that a great stock market is great for everybody,” including 401Ks.\n \n\n   \n  Citizens lucky enough to have pension funds linked to record stock markets have done well recently. But they’ve also been punished  by daily costs  and the money in their paychecks  not going as far . And that leaves the common touch Trump effectively highlighted as a candidate  now in question . Political peril lurks for him in the gap between a complex reality and his happy talk about the economy — punctuated in his speech Monday by digressions over his renaming of the Gulf of Mexico and his obsession with slow-running taps.\n \n\n   \n  Trump came over all poetic about the unique place of McDonald’s in American communities. “Before the sun rises, you’re up serving hot coffee to construction workers, nurses and police officers on the way to the job,” he said. “In the evening, you stand ready with the fast dinner and the smile for busy moms and their children. There’s a race from school to soccer practice, really, it’s Americana.”\n \n\n   \n  This was high praise coming from a master of branding. But as he often does, Trump explained his political rationale out loud. If he couldn’t truthfully claim to have delivered lower prices, he can try to steal his opponents’ branding on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  “The word is affordable,” Trump said. “And affordable should be our word, not theirs, because the Democrats got up and said ‘affordability, affordability’ and they don’t say that they had the worst inflation in history, the highest energy prices in history, everything was the worst. What they are great at is lying.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s speech came across as an attempt to show understanding about daily costs and to repair Republican vulnerabilities exposed by a big night for Democrats in  gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey  this month. But it would be hard to conclude his rambling cheerleading fulfilled either goal.\n \n\n   \n  First, and most dauntingly, for Trump, the high prices for most  food ,  housing  and  health care  that are antagonizing Americans and souring their confidence in his leadership are almost certainly not coming down.\n \n\n   \n  While inflation, the rate at which prices are rising, is at 3.0% — far lower than the 9.1% peak during the Biden Administration — costs are still going up. No economist wants to see prices go down in a cycle of deflation — that would be a harbinger of a big recession with massive job losses. But at the same time, and after decades of low inflation, voters have yet to adjust to the post-pandemic price shock.\n \n\n   \n  Maybe voters were insulated from economic pressures for decades and have unrealistic expectations. But that doesn’t make it feel any easier.\n \n\n   \n  And after driving Democrats out of the White House partly over their poor record on inflation and affordability — and 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’s lack of answers on those issues — Trump is now suffering the incumbent’s curse. He’s been office for nearly 10 months and voters aren’t feeling better, so he’s getting the blame. Affordability can get a politician elected. But it then becomes their problem.\n \n\n   \n  The statute of limitations for blaming the Biden administration is running out. “(Democrats) are saying that the runaway spending that we gave you guys, that created runaway inflation, is 100% your fault,” Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, said on CNBC Monday. But those are the breaks, even for a president who’d prefer the buck didn’t stop with him.\n \n\n   \n    How Trump is trying to ease costs\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made significant policy steps to try to alleviate the burden on working Americans. He’s trying to bring down the cost of  prescription drugs . He temporarily eliminated  tax on most tips  in his big domestic policy legislation. In his speech to McDonald’s franchise owners, he argued that his slashing of regulations that constrain small business growth would end up helping everyone.\n \n\n   \n  But insecurity felt by many Americans who are one layoff away from losing health insurance is structural and long-term; it can’t be fixed with a few quick policy initiatives.\n \n\n   \n  It’s going to need more than Trump’s first big political point in his Monday speech: “You are so damn lucky that I won that election.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s growing evidence his policies may be making things worse. Global trade wars and  high tariffs  are contributing to rising costs, according to multiple independent analyses. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, for instance, reported that the tariffs amounted to an effective tax hike on the average American household of $1,200, a figure set to rise to $1,600 next year.   A  CNN poll this month  found 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” And everyone who does their own shopping feels the pain every time they go to the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  Alleviating the situation will be tricky. Trump’s newest proposals look buzzy and may help at the margins. A potential plan to send out  $2000 tariff revenue payments  is one idea — though such a rush of cash into the economy could spike inflation. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer predicted Monday that such checks wouldn’t fix the damage and added “who knows if they’ll ever come.”\n \n\n   \n  Officials are thinking aloud about  50-year mortgages . This might get people into homes — if there’s sufficient supply. But they may never be able to pay them off.\n \n\n   \n    Tariffs may be the problem\n \n\n   \n  More fundamentally, the White House seems to be implicitly admitting that the tariffs are partly to blame, while insisting publicly that they are not. Trump issued an executive order on Friday  cutting duties  on beef, tomatoes, coffee and bananas. “The prices for those goods weren’t necessarily going up just because of tariffs,” Hassett said on ABC News “This Week” on Sunday, said on ABC News “This Week” on Sunday. But he added, “The prices will go down,” arguing that this was not due to removing tariffs but rather an increased supply of goods.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump isn’t slashing tariffs across the board. To do so would repudiate the central principle of his entire economic policy — which is designed to trigger a revival of American manufacturing. The downside of this strategy was always that if even if it works, it will take years to fully play out, after a period of economic adjustment and pain in the meantime. That’s time Trump doesn’t have, with midterm elections less than a year away.\n \n\n   \n  And the president has left himself politically exposed after attempting such a risky strategy to remake the global trading system that almost every economist predicted would raise prices. It was probably just a coincidence, but he blamed his raspy voice Monday on having to shout at somebody over trade policy with an unidentified country. “I blew my stack at these people,”  he told a reporter .\n \n\n   \n  Another complication for Trump is that his impressive power at defining the political narrative may be starting to fail him. He was just forced into a  complete reversal  by calling on the House of Representatives to vote to compel his own Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files to avoid an embarrassing political defeat.\n \n\n   \n  Even one of his top supporters,  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , is rebuking him for losing sight of the concerns of the MAGA base, including on costs. Convincing millions of voters that an election was stolen is one thing. Telling them the economy is in a “golden age” when they know well that it is not won’t work. Trump seems to be coming dangerously close to the inflation denial of the Biden administration, which helped cost Democrats the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has hardly been helping himself. Obsessing over personal legacy projects like the new  White House ballroom , dining with corporate CEOs and flying around the world in search of a Nobel Peace Prize isn’t exactly the look of a president laser-focused on the uncertainty facing millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  And his speech at the McDonald’s event did not offer any real sense of empathy for people who were hurting. He threw in the new Washington buzzword “affordability” a few times. He offered a litany of statistics that were often misleading about prices coming down. Such claims are often incomplete or untrue, as  CNN’s Daniel Dale has documented .\n \n\n   \n  But Trump did show flashes of what makes him a compelling political personality. He quipped that some people might not want to hand down wealth to children they didn’t like. If only that were a concern for most Americans. And he revealed striking new operational details about the daring US stealth bomber raid that targeted Iran’s nuclear sites earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  But his levity felt off-key given the subject, and politically unwise amid claims he’s out of touch. Trump aides are thinking about  sending him around the country  to give a series of economic speeches. But the president himself identified a potential flaw with that strategy, celebrating his refusal to stick to a script during his appearance on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he’d given a McDonald’s executive a signed page of his printed speech offstage. “‘I said, do you want to keep this? You can either hang it, you can give it to somebody, you can throw it away. I don’t care.’ But I don’t stay on the speech too long anyway, you know, so usually those speeches aren’t too accurate.”\n \n\n   \n  And one more thing. The next time the Beast presidential limo shows up at a drive-thru, the commander-in-chief has a special request. “I like the fish. I like it,” Trump said. “You could do a little bit more tartar sauce someplace, seriously.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/fema-chief-david-richardson-steps-down","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:06:00-05:00","title":"FEMA chief steps down as Trump administration prepared to oust him","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Richardson, the acting chief of FEMA, has resigned after months of controversy and criticism, marking a pivotal moment in the Trump administration’s restructuring of the agency.

 \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The embattled acting chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will step down after hurricane season following months of public controversy and internal frustration.\n \n\n   \n  David Richardson submitted a resignation letter on Monday to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, giving two weeks’ notice, the department told CNN. However, plans were already in the works at the agency to oust him from the role, three sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Richardson, a loyalist to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, was tapped to lead FEMA even though he lacked experience in disaster management. But his time in charge has been punctuated by some eyebrow-raising moments — like in a June meeting in which he told staff he  was unaware the US has a hurricane season,  a comment DHS later insisted was a joke.\n \n\n   \n  His impending departure raises the stakes for FEMA — the agency responsible for helping Americans recover from the nation’s worst disasters — as Noem and DHS prepare for sweeping reforms that could fundamentally reshape its future.\n \n\n   \n  A FEMA official with knowledge of the decision said Karen Evans, a close Trump administration ally at DHS and FEMA’s newly appointed chief of staff, will replace Richardson.   A DHS spokesperson later said in a statement that Evans will will start in her new role on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson said the agencies thanked Richardson “for his dedicated service and wish him continued success in his return to the private sector.”\n \n\n   \n  Richardson’s leadership faced its toughest test in July, when  catastrophic floods devastated Texas  and killed more than 130 people. As the crisis unfolded, Richardson was on vacation and unreachable for hours. He later told lawmakers he spent the entire trip in his truck, glued to his phone, coordinating the response.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Richardson was publicly silent and absent from the flood zone, surfacing more than a week later for an unannounced visit to Texas — days after President Donald Trump and Noem toured the area. He arrived in a straw hat and cowboy boots, notably lacking any FEMA insignia — a striking departure from the typical image of agency leaders on the front lines of a crisis.\n \n\n   \n  His absence was not by chance. DHS leaders had instructed FEMA to keep Richardson’s Texas trip under wraps until he left the state, deliberately shielding him from the press, three sources with knowledge of the decision said.\n \n\n   \n  Richardson later defended his leadership and told lawmakers the DHS response in Texas was a “model for how to respond to a disaster.”\n \n\n   \n  Traditionally, the FEMA administrator is the president’s right hand for natural disasters and national emergencies. But in Trump’s second term, Richardson has been largely pushed to the sidelines, with his authority steadily diminished by Noem.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Monday, Richardson defended his short tenure at FEMA, arguing that he “didn’t hesitate” to take on the leadership post just weeks before hurricane season began.\n \n\n   \n  “I agreed to be the acting administrator through hurricane season when others wouldn’t. Hurricane season ends on 1 December. Since the danger has largely passed, I can now leave for other opportunities,” he said. “Many were asked. One raised his hand and said, ‘I’ll do it.’”\n \n\n   \n    Criticism of Richardson’s leadership at FEMA\n \n\n   \n  A former Marine combat veteran, martial arts instructor and  painter,  Richardson previously led the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction office at DHS but had no experience managing natural disasters when he was tapped for the FEMA role in May.  His predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, also a Trump administration appointee, was fired  for clashing with senior homeland security officials and opposing the administration’s push to eliminate FEMA.\n \n\n   \n  “He never should have been there to begin with,” Hamilton, who worked with Richardson during his time in the administration, told CNN this week. “The two words I’d use to describe him are unprofessional and overwhelmed.”\n \n\n   \n  Richardson’s appointment marked a turning point as DHS tightened its grip on FEMA, installing loyalists in key positions and pushing out veteran disaster experts. Unlike Hamilton, Richardson was seen as someone who would follow orders. He’s a personal friend of longtime Trump ally  Corey Lewandowski, who is helping Noem run DHS  as her chief adviser.\n \n\n   \n  On his first day, Richardson told FEMA staff he alone spoke for the agency and warned he would “run right over” anyone who didn’t fall in line.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials describe his leadership as brash and unpredictable, with a penchant for shouting and swearing. On one occasion, he asked staff whether disaster funds could be steered to Republican areas but not Democratic ones, a FEMA official who heard the comments firsthand said.\n \n\n   \n  At times, Richardson prohibited staff from bringing cell phones and computers into meetings. He often kept his own phone out of sight and rarely used email, leaving senior FEMA leaders struggling to reach him and making even basic communication a constant challenge.\n \n\n   \n  Over the months, Noem and her team had grown frustrated with Richardson’s distracting antics and failure to effectively communicate their FEMA reforms to Congress and the public, three sources with knowledge of the conversations told CNN. But senior leaders ultimately decided it made more sense to wait until after hurricane season to remove him.\n \n\n   \n  The department has steadily reduced his role, treating him more as a liability than an asset. DHS has repeatedly blocked his requests to speak at conventions or to lead public information campaigns about hurricane season, two sources said.\n \n\n   \n  “Have you heard him speak?” an administration official told CNN. “He does more damage than good.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent months, the department has reassigned some of Richardson’s closest allies and surrounded him with senior staff who have further limited his authority.\n \n\n   \n    FEMA’s future at a crossroads\n \n\n   \n  The timing of Richardson’s removal is significant. Once hurricane season ends at the end of the month, the administration is set to fast-track its sweeping transformation of FEMA.\n \n\n   \n  The new FEMA Review Council, which is headed by Noem, will soon deliver its much-anticipated report, outlining recommendations to reshape the agency. As the dust settles, FEMA’s future — and its ability to respond when disaster strikes — hangs in the balance.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, dozens of lawmakers have signed on to a bipartisan bill known as the “FEMA Act” that would remove the agency from DHS and make it independent — a change Noem vehemently opposes, multiple sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Noem have been  overhauling FEMA since taking office  as they vow to shift more responsibility for disaster preparedness, response and recovery onto states. While they once called for the agency’s outright elimination, their tone has shifted in recent months, signaling a dramatic restructuring may be in store. Either way, current and former high-ranking FEMA officials have  warned that growing turmoil at the agency is putting Americans at risk .\n \n\n   \n  More than a quarter of the agency’s full-time staff have left through layoffs and buyouts — including dozens of longtime senior leaders — and morale has plummeted amid frequent public attacks from administration officials, including Noem and Trump.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration has benefited from the mildest hurricane season in a decade, with no hurricanes making landfall anywhere in the US for the first time since 2015.\n \n\n   \n  “FEMA likely would have failed had there been a major disaster,” a former high-ranking FEMA official told CNN. “Having no big disasters has absolutely played into the Trump narrative that there is no need for FEMA. And it hasn’t allowed the American people to see just how bad they need the agency, since the states just aren’t prepared.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/football-nfl-bengals-chase-suspended-spitting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:16:00-05:00","title":"Bengals Receiver Ja’Marr Chase Suspended One Game for Spitting on Steelers’ Jalen Ramsey","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase was suspended one game without pay by the NFL for spitting on Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey during a game on November 16, 2025.

Epstein emails and will pause public engagements \n       \n  By MJ Lee, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:09 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Larry Summers said Monday night that he was “deeply ashamed” about his relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, telling CNN that he would pause all public engagements as he works to “rebuild trust and repair relationships” — but the Harvard University professor added that he will continue teaching as some call for the university to sever ties with him.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said. “While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.”\n \n\n   \n  New details of Summers’ relationship with Epstein emerged last week when a House committee  released emails  showing years of personal correspondence between the two men, including Summers making sexist comments and seeking Epstein’s romantic advice.\n \n\n   \n  Summers’ first statement addressing the newly unveiled Epstein correspondence comes on the heels of Sen. Elizabeth Warren calling on Harvard to sever ties with Summers and putting new pressure on the elite university to hold Summers accountable for his close friendship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor and now the Democratic senior senator from Massachusetts, had said in response to a CNN inquiry that she believes Summers — Harvard’s former president and one of its most prominent faculty members — “cannot be trusted” with students given his past relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,” Warren told CNN. “If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein’s sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation’s politicians, policymakers, and institutions — or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.”\n \n\n   \n  Harvard has not responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Center for American Progress, the left-leaning think tank where Summers has been a senior fellow, said Monday night after Summers’ statement: “Larry Summers has announced that he is stepping away from public commitments immediately, and this includes ending his fellowship at CAP.”\n \n\n   \n  Summers served as Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary and Barack Obama’s director of the National Economic Council and has been one of the country’s most influential economic voices for decades. Warren, an economic populist, has  clashed   with Summers   over financial regulations  in the past.\n \n\n   \n  But her new call on policymakers and institutions to shun Summers represented an even sharper critique of his character.\n \n\n   \n  Summers resigned as Harvard’s president in 2006 under pressure amid multiple controversies, including his suggestion that men may perform better in the sciences because of genetic differences from women. He  currently serves  as the Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard.\n \n\n   \n  The House Oversight Committee released  tens of thousands of pages  of documents on Wednesday that it received from the Epstein estate. Included in the recent trove were numerous exchanges between Summers and Epstein between at least 2013 and 2019. Epstein  pleaded guilty  in 2008 to state charges in Florida of one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor.\n \n\n   \n  The messages show the two men frequently bantered about current events, political headlines and high-profile figures in elite orbits — everything from Iran’s nuclear policy to Donald Trump’s first-term decisions in the White House.\n \n\n   \n  At other times, the two men appeared to discuss Summers’ romantic endeavors, with Epstein offering advice.\n \n\n   \n  In November 2018, for example, Summers seemed to forward an email from a woman to solicit Epstein’s advice on when to write back.\n \n\n   \n  “Think no response for a while probably appropriate,” Summers wrote. (He happened to ask in the same email whether Epstein believed Trump was “getting crazier” or was “steady crazy.”)\n \n\n   \n  Epstein wrote back in part: “she’s already beginning to sound needy :) nice.”\n \n\n   \n  In March 2019, the two men exchanged multiple emails over the course of one morning, appearing to debate whether Summers should send a note to a woman of romantic interest. Summers’ continued contact with Epstein  during this period  was particularly noteworthy because the Miami Herald published just months prior an  exhaustive investigative series  detailing Epstein’s abuse of underage girls, and exposed what the paper called “the deal of a lifetime” that he negotiated in 2007 and 2008 to avoid federal charges.\n \n\n   \n  Sending a note would be “BAD FORM,” Epstein argued to Summers.\n \n\n   \n  “Why bad form. Supposed to be face to face?” Summers wrote back.\n \n\n   \n  “you care very much for this person. You might want to demonstrate that. a note does the very opposite,” Epstein wrote back, before appearing to compare the situation to Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n \n\n   \n  And in one October 2017 email to Epstein, Summers mused: “I observed that half the IQ In world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.”\n \n\n   \n  Summers’ wife, Elisa New, is a  professor emerita  of American literature at Harvard. The Wall Street Journal  previously reported  that Summers had asked Epstein to donate money to his wife’s nonprofit. The school’s student paper, The Harvard Crimson,  reported on the outrage  among some professors about the emails between Summers and Epstein. Rachel McCleary, a lecturer in the economics department, where Summers still teaches, told The Crimson his relationship with Epstein was not “just one lapse” but rather a “character flaw.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said after the release of the latest batch of Epstein files, which included numerous comments and discussions about the president, that he is  asking his attorney general , Pam Bondi, to investigate Epstein’s ties to high-profile figures and institutions. Among those Trump singled out were Summers, Clinton and JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  The Economic Club of New York announced Monday that it postponed an upcoming event featuring Summers, according to an email obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The  virtual event , scheduled for Wednesday, was billed as a discussion about “the future of fiscal and monetary policy,” with Summers and an economics professor from Columbia University. But the club said in an email to registered attendees that there had been an “unavoidable change in schedule,” spurring the postponement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN if the postponement was influenced by the Epstein revelations, a club spokeswoman reiterated that it was “due to an unavoidable change in schedule.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/saudi-crown-prince-trump-white-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:43:00Z","title":"Trump pulling out all the stops to welcome Saudi crown prince for first White House visit since Khashoggi killing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is planning a full-scale, state-level welcome for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House, marking the prince’s first visit since 2018 and signaling a significant effort to strengthen US-Saudi relations.

    \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  is planning to receive Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman  at the White House on Tuesday with all the trappings of a state visit, sources familiar with the matter said, including a welcome ceremony in the morning and a formal dinner in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re more than meeting,” Trump said late Friday as he flew to Florida for the weekend. “We’re honoring Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince.”\n \n\n   \n  While the White House has decided to pull out all the stops, the visit cannot be classified as an official state visit as Prince bin Salman is not Saudi Arabia’s head of state. That position is occupied by his 89-year-old father,  King Salman . But the crown prince has assumed almost all day-to-day responsibility for ruling the kingdom, and attends summits and other diplomatic engagements as the country’s leader.\n \n\n   \n  On the eve of Prince bin Salman’s first  visit to the White House  in more than seven years, Trump announced that the US would be selling  F-35 fighter jets  to Saudi Arabia — a controversial step that could alter the military balance in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve been a great ally,” Trump told reporters. “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has worked to cultivate a close relationship with the kingdom’s de facto ruler in the hopes he will decide to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, which would be a major advancement of the president’s signature  Abraham Accords  — a longtime goal of the president’s.\n \n\n   \n  “The Abraham Accords will be a part we’re going to be discussing,” Trump said Friday. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly.”\n \n\n   \n  The prince last visited Washington in 2018, months before the murder of dissident journalist  Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate  in Turkey. A CIA assessment released afterward found the prince had likely ordered the assassination, though he has long denied any involvement. Hanan Elatr Khashoggi,  Khashoggi’s widow , told CNN’s Jim Sciutto of the planned White House meeting: “It’s very painful for me. It will be better if Jamal was here and receiving the crown prince by himself and meet with him and share with him his vision and mission, and all of his ideas.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump never entirely cut off ties with the crown prince during his first term, though he wasn’t invited back to the White House. Even Trump’s successor President Joe Biden, who vowed as a candidate to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” for its human rights record, visited Riyadh while in office and fist bumped Prince bin Salman.\n \n\n   \n  With Tuesday’s visit, any semblance of a rupture in  US-Saudi ties  appears to have disappeared. The plans include a welcome ceremony involving military bands, a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office and a black-tie dinner in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  The first tranche of invitations were sent out earlier this month and the guest list includes largely chief executives, as well as lawmakers and governors — some of whom Trump himself called to invite to the dinner, people familiar with the plans said. The event is being coordinated by first lady Melania Trump, as all state visits are planned through the first lady’s office.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has yet to hold a state visit in his second term, which is typically put on as a sign of friendship and to display the close relationship the US shares with its allies, during his second term. Trump broke with tradition during his first administration by opting not to hold a state dinner during his first year in office, though he went on to host the president of France and prime minister of Australia in 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump looks forward to welcoming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to the White House, where the two leaders will participate in an official working visit,” a White House official said in a statement to CNN. “We will not get ahead of the President on conversations that are occurring ahead of time.”\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia is also planning an investment summit to coincide with the crown prince’s trip to Washington. The event at the Kennedy Center, a day after the White House visit, is intended to link up American and Saudi business leaders for financial opportunities.\n \n\n   \n  In May, Trump visited Saudi Arabia for the first state visit of his second term and was welcomed with  elaborate pageantry , including a fighter jet escort, an honor guard with golden swords and a fleet of Arabian horses accompanying his limousine. The president has sought to deepen ties to other Gulf states during his tenure, including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n \n\n   \n  Before the May stop, Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the United States. Trump brought several American executives with him to Riyadh, and signed several agreements. Many have yet to be fully implemented.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s meetings, US and Saudi officials were working to finalize agreements on defense and security cooperation, a US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Riyadh has long sought the F-35s, one of the most advanced military jets in the world. But Israel — the only country in the Middle East with the jets — is worried about maintaining its military edge. Congress could block export licenses for the F-35s to Saudi Arabia, though it’s unusual.\n \n\n   \n    Discussions about normalizing relations with Israel\n \n\n   \n  Atop Trump’s agenda will be a discussion of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel, a step he believes is within reach after he helped broker a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The October 7, 2023, terror attack in Israel, and the war that followed, largely put on hold the normalization discussions that began during Trump’s first term and advanced during Biden’s. A framework being discussed before the attacks would include a US defense treaty with Saudi Arabia and help building a civilian nuclear program in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Biden and many of his top aides have said they believe the October 7 attack was intended, in part, to obstruct the normalization talks. Now that a ceasefire is in place, Trump believes a deal can be quickly reached.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in,” Trump told Fox News last month. “I think they’re going to all go in very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, some hurdles remain in getting the crown prince on board. While he and Trump are expected to sign a defense cooperation agreement Tuesday, it falls short of the treaty under discussion in earlier phases of normalization discussions, the US official said. A formal treaty would require congressional approval.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia has also said a condition to normalizing ties with Israel is a “credible” and “irreversible” pathway to Palestinian statehood, which the Gaza plan Trump helped broker stops short of providing.\n \n\n   \n  And for Saudi Arabia, another issue is high on the agenda — the stability of Sudan, which it views as critical for its own security, believing that only Trump can stop external support for the civil war there.\n \n\n   \n  But American officials are nonetheless hopeful about making progress on the normalization issue during Tuesday’s meeting.\n \n\n   \n  One of the architects of the Abraham Accords, Trump’s son-in-law  Jared Kushner , visited Riyadh last week for talks with the crown prince ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, a White House official and a person familiar with the matter said. Kushner has long had a close, personal relationship with the Saudi prince, and has been deployed several times in recent months to use his ties to Mideast leaders to help lay the groundwork for Trump’s agenda and build upon the Abraham Accords.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the sensitive dynamic of the visit are Trump’s  personal financial interests in the region . The Trump Organization, which is being run by the president’s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, is involved in major real estate projects in Saudi Arabia. Kushner also has significant business ties to the country. Kushner’s investment fund, Affinity Partners, has raised billions of dollars in capital from Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated on Monday with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/trump-epstein-files-reluctant-reversal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:12:00-05:00","title":"Trump Reverses Course on Epstein Files to Avoid Embarrassment and Refocus Political Agenda","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump reversed his opposition to the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s files after realizing that continued resistance would lead to an embarrassing defeat in the House.

But that doesn’t mean he’s happy about it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump threw his support behind a congressional effort to release all the files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after it became clear that he could not halt its momentum and that he risked suffering an embarrassing blow on the House floor, people familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The stark reality, which was conveyed to Trump by allies and advisers in recent days, drove the president’s abrupt reversal Sunday evening and his comments Monday that he’ll sign the measure if it comes to his desk. It’s a decision he came to reluctantly, but one that is now likely to clear the way for the measure’s overwhelming passage in the House on Tuesday and for the Senate to take it up after that.\n \n\n   \n  “Sure, I would,” Trump said from the Oval Office on Monday when asked whether he’d sign the measure.\n \n\n   \n  It was a rare moment of retreat for a president who has made a habit of bending Washington to his will since returning to office. And it came after the White House privately tried and failed last week to pressure a handful of Republican lawmakers to abandon their support for the measure, and days after Trump attacked those defectors as “soft and foolish.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again,” the president wrote in one post on Truth Social. “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republicans would fall into that trap.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump remains personally frustrated by the continuing focus on the Epstein files, the people familiar with the matter said, viewing them as a distraction from his agenda that Democrats have since co-opted as fodder for political attacks. The president resents being tied to Epstein, who he has said he cut ties with well before Epstein was charged with any crimes, and has been irritated at the central role some of his close allies have played in the campaign for the files, those people said.\n \n\n   \n  Just 48 hours before flipping his stance on the Epstein files, Trump attacked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in bitterly personal terms over her strident support for the House measure, withdrawing his endorsement and labeling the Georgia Republican a “traitor.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump ultimately shifted his own position after advisers and allies convinced him that the House measure’s passage was inevitable despite his best efforts — and that fighting it was only fueling more attention.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in what one of the people familiar with the matter characterized as a tactical move, Trump and his allies are hoping that backing the speedy passage of the measure will allow Republicans to move past the issue more quickly and give the administration an opening to refocus attention on policy efforts that Trump has complained are going ignored.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll just get this done and move it on,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday” over the weekend. “There’s nothing to hide.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson on Monday suggested he may vote for the measure after months of siding with Trump against it, citing new optimism that the Senate will “be able to correct” some of his concerns over its language.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since adopted that attitude, encouraging Republicans on Monday to shift their focus to areas that are viewed as far more crucial to next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  “All I want is I want for people to recognize a great job that I’ve done on pricing, on affordability,” he said. “I don’t want to take it away from really the greatness of what the Republican Party has accomplished.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump in the meantime has also sought to turn the Epstein issue against Democrats, ordering a Justice Department investigation of the former financier’s ties to a range of people including former President Bill Clinton and prominent economic adviser  Larry Summers . (Neither has been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and nor has Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson cited the probe as evidence that Trump has wanted “transparency related to the Epstein files.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s announcement has sparked fresh questions about whether the Justice Department could then cite the open investigation in refusing to turn over documents to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN that Trump has not ordered the department to stand in the way of any congressional requests, but it’s unclear how it will respond if the House measure is ultimately signed into law.\n \n\n   \n  That consideration, though, is likely weeks away. The Senate is due to break for a Thanksgiving recess at the end of the week, meaning it likely could not take up the measure until December at the earliest. And despite the broad bipartisan support in the House, Senate Majority Leader John Thune remains uncommitted on bringing the Epstein measure to the floor quickly, or even at all, a GOP leadership aide said.\n \n\n   \n  That provides the White House with an opening that allies hope Trump can take advantage of to refocus voters and elevate the far more advantageous elements of his agenda, the people familiar with the matter said — for at least as long as they can keep the Epstein issue at bay.\n \n\n   \n  “It never fully gets tamped … and part of that is just the sheer fact that a conspiracy theory never goes away,” said Doug Heye, a longtime GOP strategist. “Trump has ways of distracting and turning our attention away, but what’s to say it doesn’t pop up two months down the road or six months down the road?”\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself alluded to that on Monday when voicing his support for releasing the files.\n \n\n   \n  “No matter what we give, it’s never enough,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"Tiny Desk Concerts Carousel - February 28, 2024","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting live music performances from various artists on NPR's Tiny Desk series.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["music","npr","tiny desk concerts","featured performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611088","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Poll: Democrats have biggest advantage for control of Congress in 8 years","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the United States approaches the 2026 midterm elections, a recent poll by NPR/PBS News/Marist shows Democrats holding their largest advantage over Republicans on the congressional ballot since 2017—14 points—indicating strong voter support for Democratic candidates.

19, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Heading into the 2026 midterm elections, there are some very big warning signs for Republicans in the latest  NPR/PBS News/Marist poll . The survey of 1,443 adults, conducted from Nov. 10-13 found: Democrats holding their largest advantage, 14 points, since 2017 on the question of who respondents would vote for if the midterm elections were held today; President Trump's approval rating is just 39%, his lowest since right after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol; A combined 6-in-10 blame congressional Republicans or Trump for the  government shutdown ; and  Nearly 6-in-10 say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices — and no other issue comes close. \"I don't think rent prices or food prices are at the forefront like they should be,\" said Nicole Stokes of Dallas, Texas, who participated in NPR's poll and voted for Trump last year. \"You know – the American people – it's our pockets that are getting ripped apart to fund things.\" From the political parties and Congress to the Supreme Court and the media, other respondents said they had little to no confidence in these critical institutions. \"I feel lost,\" said poll respondent Wayne Dowdy of Memphis, Tenn., who calls himself a \"lapsed Democrat.\" \"The parties don't speak to me anymore.\" He said he often feels unseen by the Democratic Party, but, given the alternative, he plans to keep supporting Democratic candidates — for now. The disillusionment extends to how people see those in the opposite political party. Big majorities of Democrats and Republicans said the other party is \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\" about politics. All of it makes for a volatile political stew heading into the holidays, but with Republicans in charge of all the levers of power in Washington, Democrats have the clear advantage a year out from next year's midterm elections. Democrats in the driver's seat for control of Congress Coming off huge wins up and down the ballot across the country in this year's off-year elections, Democrats lead Republicans, 55%-41%, when people were asked who they would vote for in their district if the election for Congress were held today. It's the largest Democratic advantage on this question, known as the congressional ballot, in the Marist poll since November 2017. The parallel is striking, considering that was at the same point in Trump's first term as this poll now. Democrats wound up winning 40 House seats in 2018. What's more, independents chose Democrats by a 33-point margin on this question. It's all quite the reversal of fortune from a year ago when, just before the 2024 elections when President Trump won back the White House, the parties were tied on the congressional ballot. Historically, Democrats have needed a sizable advantage on the congressional ballot to signal that they would do well in upcoming midterms. Consider: In the fall of 2022, with Democratic President Biden in the White House, Democrats' lead ranged from 0 to 4 points. They  lost 9 House seats ; In 2018, during Trump's first term, Democrats' lead ranged between 6 and 12. They won 40 seats;  In 2014, when Democrat Barack Obama was president, Republicans had a 5-point advantage. The GOP gained 13 seats. All that said, with redistricting, the  number of competitive seats  has  shrunk significantly , so major gains are less likely than they were in previous years. Trump has also encouraged conservatives in red states to try and create more Republican districts in rare mid-decade redistricting. Democrats have responded in kind, so the landscape for control of the House for next year remains uncertain at this point. The Trump drag on the GOP A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular. Not only is he at 39% approval, the lowest of this second term in the Marist poll, but he gets just a 24% rating with independents as well. Overall, almost half of those surveyed – 48% – said they  strongly  disapprove of the job the president is doing. That's also the highest of this term and the highest since just after Jan. 6, 2021. The president has seen low ratings for his handling of various policy areas, including the  economy  and  foreign policy , and people think he's  gone too far  on immigration. Trump  has said  on  more than one occasion  in this second term that while campaign advisers told him prices were the most important issue, he always felt it was really immigration. But respondents in the NPR survey are sending a clear message: they think the cost of living should be Trump's top priority. Almost 6-in-10 – 57% – said lowering prices should be his top priority. Immigration is a distant second at 16%. Even a plurality of Republicans (40%) said lowering prices should be the priority compared to immigration (34%). Despite Trump's slide in approval ratings, he's holding up well with his base – 9-in-10 Republicans continue to say they approve of the job he's doing. Stokes, the Trump voter from Dallas, said a year into his presidency, said she's pleased by his attempts to tackle illegal border crossings and restrict U.S. foreign aid, but she is concerned that the president hasn't made the economy a focus. But her support of Trump doesn't translate to Republicans on Capitol Hill. Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party. \"They're not in tune with anyone on the ground,\" Stokes said. \"I don't really see anyone in [the House] or in the Senate that's really for the American people right now.\" It's not just Trump. Democrats and others get low marks Trump's approval is low and so is confidence in the office he holds – 61% said they have little to no confidence in the institution of the presidency. But the scores were even poorer for other key institutions. Worst among them was Congress – 80% said they had little to no confidence in it, followed by the media (75%), the Democratic Party (71%), the Republican Party (65%) and the Supreme Court (62%). This is yet another poll that shows Democrats have a problem with their base. While 80% of Republicans have \"quite a lot\" or a \"great deal\" of confidence in the GOP, just 57% of Democrats said the same of their party. Despite long supporting liberal candidates, Dowdy, the Democrat from Memphis, argues the party has become disconnected from everyday voters. \"They don't interact with working people,\" he said, \"regardless of whether they work in an office or on a job site or building homes or working in a factory. They don't know how people like that live... They have no connection to the real people. And there's no attempt to try and reach that.\" And yet, Democrats have a wide advantage on the congressional ballot, which, coupled with the electoral gains earlier this month, indicate that left-leaning voters may rally to Democrats' side when faced with having to choose between them and Republicans. Democrats and Republicans see each other as \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\" It's no wonder political acrimony is as high as it is in the country; people have very little respect for where the other side is coming from. The survey found that more than 8-in-10 Republicans and Democrats described people in the other political party as \"closed-minded\"; more than 7-in-10 Republicans and roughly two-thirds of Democrats also see the other as \"dishonest\" when talking about politics. Independents have better views of Democrats than Republicans. They said Republicans were more dishonest and closed-minded than Democrats with a majority of independents (54%) saying Republicans were \"mostly dishonest\" compared to more than 6-in-10 saying Democrats were \"mostly honest\" when it came to politics. Nearly 7-in-10 independents also described Republicans as mostly closed-minded, while a majority (53%) said Democrats were mostly open-minded. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611438","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:47:00-05:00","title":"House and Senate Both Approve Releasing the Epstein Files by a Near Unanimous Margin","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Both the U.S. House and Senate have approved a bipartisan measure to compel the Department of Justice to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.

Updated Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 5:47 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Both the House and the Senate have moved to send to President Trump's desk a measure that would compel the Department of Justice to make public its files regarding the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The measure advanced through both chambers Tuesday following a day of quick action by the standards of Congress. The measure first passed the House by a near unanimous margin of 427 to 1 late in the afternoon. Less than three hours later, the Senate set up a process to approve the House measure without a formal vote after Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., offered a motion to pass the legislation as soon as it is received from the House. Once received, it will be deemed as passed. Schumer offered the measure by unanimous consent; no senators objected and the bill was approved. The legislation's success illustrated a rare win for Republicans willing to defy Trump, who has held a tight grip on the GOP-led Congress since his return to office. Republicans who supported the measure said their party needed to make good on a campaign promise to release the files. Tuesday's action followed an unexpected blessing for the measure from President Trump on Sunday. Trump's support was a dramatic reversal on a measure that previously deeply divided the GOP and has caused immense fighting among some of Trump's most ardent supporters. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Prior to Schumer's motion in the Senate, the measure passed in the House by a vote of 427 to 1.  The lone no vote came from Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins. In a post on social media, Higgins said the bill \"abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure,\" and he warned of potential harm for \"witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc.\"  \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt,\" he wrote.  A vote that split Republicans for months The bipartisan effort — led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif. — was long fought by Trump and Republican leadership from reaching the House floor. As recently as last week, White House officials met with Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.,  about her support for releasing the files , but her position was unchanged after the meeting. Ahead of Tuesday's vote in the House, Massie said that although it took four months to force the vote through a process known as a discharge petition, he was confident it would draw near unanimous support. \"We fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win,\" Massie said. But \"they're on our side today ... they are finally on the side of justice.\"  Until his about face over the weekend, Trump spent months attacking Republicans for pushing the measure, including Massie and most recently  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , R-Ga. On Sunday, after it became clear a vote in the House was likely to succeed, Trump said Republicans  should approve the bill .  Ahead of Tuesday's vote, survivors joined Massie, Greene and Khanna in front of the Capitol and shared harrowing stories of getting pulled into the sex trafficking network as minors, and their subsequent fight for justice. Several took aim at President Trump, saying he had politicized their fight.  One survivor, Jena-Lisa Jones, said watching their push for transparency turn political has been painful to watch. \"We are hearing the administration say they intend to investigate various Democrats who were friends with Epstein. I beg you President Trump, please stop making this political. It is not about you,\" Jones told reporters. \"You are our president, please start acting like it ... I voted for you, but your behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.\"   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Greene also addressed the political fight over the Epstein files — and the president's criticism of her more specifically. She said her falling out with Trump \"has torn MAGA apart.\"  \"I was called a traitor by a man that I fought ... six years for, and I gave him my loyalty for free,\" she said. \"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition.\"   The path to Trump's desk On Monday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the Senate can take up the bill as well, and that he would sign it if it passes. Trump does not need legislation in order to approve the files for release, but he told reporters that Congress \"can do whatever they want\" on the vote. \"I'm all for it,\" Trump said from the Oval Office, but maintained it was a \"hoax\" that he didn't want to \"detract\" from his party's success. His remarks came after a simple majority of House members signed onto what is known as a discharge petition — a workaround that forces votes without leadership or committee approval. Last week, the chamber's newest member, Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., became  the decisive 218th signature on the petition . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Grijalva's swearing in was delayed for seven weeks after her election, galvanizing Democrats who accused Johnson of stalling in order to  put off the vote . The Speaker rejected that claim, saying her oath of office would not be taken until the government shutdown fight was resolved.  Tuesday's vote also comes after a wave of Epstein files were released last week by members on the Republican-led House Oversight Committee. Democrats first released  a set of three emails , followed by  thousands of pages of new files  released by the panel's chairman, James Comer, R-Ky. The documents triggered new questions about the extent of Trump's relationship with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender before his death in 2019. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/hongkong-soccer-stadium-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:30","title":"Hong Kong Soccer Team Draws Near 50,000 Fans at New Stadium, Marking Historic Resurgence","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hong Kong’s soccer team, ranked 148th in the world, is experiencing a remarkable resurgence in fan support and attendance, fueled by the opening of the new Kai Tak Sports Park stadium.

soccer’s 148th-best team is pulling crowds of nearly 50,000 people \n       \n  By Fred He, James Legge, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:26 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On a steamy Tuesday night in June, 42,570 Hongkongers packed into a spectacular new harborside stadium located in their city’s urban heart.\n \n\n   \n   Built on the site of a former airport , the 50,000-seat Kai Tak Sports Park was completed this March – and has been the crucible of a resurgence in support for the local team, where a red sea of fans now regularly cheers on the players.\n \n\n   \n  Ranked 148th in the world – just between Ethiopia and the Solomon Islands – Hong Kong’s soccer team has never seen home crowds of this size, with attendances even for crucial qualifiers normally under 15,000.\n \n\n   \n  But recent games have pulled in audiences more like those at top-tier international matches.\n \n\n   \n  “We never had this many fans watching the Hong Kong team,” said Shinichi Chan, the 23-year-old rising star who is a regular starter of the team. “The stadium is becoming our new home.”\n \n\n   \n  Chester Cheung was among the crowd on June 10, a day he won’t forget. That night, Hong Kong defeated India 1-0 in the Asian Cup qualifiers – a series of matches deciding which teams go to the continent’s showpiece event in Saudi Arabia in 2027. For Cheung, a core member of a Hong Kong fan group, watching the team’s debut at the brand-new stadium was “a dream come true.”\n \n\n   \n  “I cried,” said the 29-year-old, who spent two to three months preparing for the game with his organization Chisinlo, named after a Cantonese phrase meaning “crazy people”.\n \n\n   \n  Arriving three to four hours before the game, Cheung and his mates from the group prepared flags, drums, megaphones, banners, and face-painting stickers. They also helped display a huge tifo, which they had a hand in designing.\n \n\n   \n  The fans’ energy set the stage for the players.\n \n\n   \n  “Wearing the Hong Kong team jersey, walking out of the tunnel, and seeing all the fans supporting Hong Kong is such an unbelievable feeling,” recalled Chan, who played midfielder at the game against India. “It is always going to be in my mind and push me ever harder to play better football.”\n \n\n   \n  The momentum rolled into to the next home game, where more than 45,000 fans filled the stands - a new record for the team - during a 1-1 draw against Bangladesh last month.\n \n\n   \n  Cheung said the team’s debut at Kai Tak was “a very good entry point” for those who had not watched much soccer before, as many of them were attracted by social media videos of that game and decided to give the following games a try.\n \n\n   \n  And on Tuesday, Hong Kong will face Singapore at its third home game at Kai Tak, and tickets are already sold out.\n \n\n   \n  The packed stands should come as little surprise in a city with a rich soccer tradition going back to its time as a British colony.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s first professional league was established as early as 1908, one of the oldest in Asia. It flourished in the 1970s and 80s, but since then has lost fans lured by globalized European leagues, in particular the English Premier League.\n \n\n   \n  The team’s more hardcore fans in the past have also been outspoken supporters of Hong Kong’s unique Cantonese identity, culture and language, something that has occasionally caused political frictions with local authorities. Britain handed the Asian financial hub back to China in 1997 under an agreement where it is meant to keep a level of autonomy for 50 years.\n \n\n   \n  In the years leading up to the massive and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests that swept Hong Kong in 2019, China’s national anthem was  frequently greeted with jeers and boos  from supporters of the local team.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong authorities have since  made it illegal  to show disrespect to the national anthem, silencing the jeering in the stands as such public act of defiance could now lead to fines and lengthy imprisonment.\n \n\n   \n    New stadium\n \n\n   \n  In addition to serving as the home stadium for the city’s soccer team, the Kai Tak Sports Park is central to Hong Kong’s bid to reclaim its status as Asia’s premier destination for mega-events, after losing out to rival cities like Singapore and Tokyo in attracting some of the world’s biggest stars.\n \n\n   \n  And the progress is already noticeable. Since April, the sprawling waterfront complex has hosted performers from the rock band Coldplay to Asian pop stars JJ Lin and Jay Chou, as well as major sport events including  Rugby Sevens  and English soccer’s  North London Derby .\n \n\n   \n  But for Cheung, who has followed the Hong Kong soccer team at different home venues for 10 years, the best part about Kai Tak Sports Park is the air conditioning – not to be sniffed at in a subtropical city of swelteringly humid summers.\n \n\n   \n  “So no matter the weather, no matter how hot it is, it is still very comfortable inside, ” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just Hong Kong seeing large fan-bases for teams that are far from the top of international rankings.\n \n\n   \n  Soccer across Southeast Asia has been drawing bigger crowds in recent years. Countries and regions are putting more efforts into naturalizing foreign players and cultivating young talents, which has helped boost their competitiveness on the Asian stage.\n \n\n   \n  The international nature of Hong Kong is also reflected in the team’s ethnic diversity.\n \n\n   \n  It now blends a growing group of naturalized players, including Brazil-born striker Everton Camargo and France-born winger Raphaël Merkies, with a core of local talent thriving in mainland China’s top-tier league. Chan is among them, now in his second impressive season with Shanghai Shenhua after helping the top Chinese club lift last year’s league title.\n \n\n   \n  Both fans and players are ready for the do-or-die game against Singapore Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “I expect a great atmosphere, and every (fan) will spend 120% of their efforts in cheering and supporting the team,” said Cheung, who will be in the stadium with the fan group. “We are telling the fans that this time is not for entertainment. It is a fight. It’s a war.”\n \n\n   \n  For Chan and his teammates, victory is the only goal, with a spot in Saudi Arabia still up for grabs.\n \n\n   \n  “Kai Tak is giving me this feeling that we are stepping forward together as Hong Kong football, with the better venue, to play and provide better experiences for the fans,” said Chan. “And hopefully, we can create something great together.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5607250","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:06:00-04:00","title":"Flu season could be nasty this winter","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Early data suggests the U.S. may face a severe flu season in 2025–2026, driven by strong flu activity in the Southern Hemisphere and a dominant H3N2 strain in the Northern Hemisphere, including a newly evolved variant that may evade immune recognition.

19, 2025 • 5:06 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The U.S. may be entering another rough winter for flu, according to early data. \"The signs are, it could be a big season,\" says  Richard Webby , who studies the flu at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. \"The flu season might have a little bit of a punch to it this year.\" The first clue to what may be in store is what influenza did during the Southern Hemisphere's winter. That often predicts what's coming for the Northern Hemisphere. \"They had some pretty decent flu activity in many parts of the Southern Hemisphere,\" Webby says. \"It actually lasted for a longer period of time — the tail of the season went on for longer than typical.\" And now, parts of the Northern Hemisphere, such as the United Kingdom, are being hit hard. That often foreshadows what's in store for the U.S. Another clue is the Northern Hemisphere's dominant flu strain so far. It's an H3N2 flu virus,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  flu tracker. And H3N2 viruses \"tend to be a little bit more problematic,\" Webby says. \"When we have an H3N2 season, we tend to have a little bit more activity, a little bit more disease at the severe end of the spectrum.\" The last major flu season dominated by H3N2 was 2016-2017. In addition, a new H3N2 variant recently evolved and has become the dominant strain in the U.S. \"There is basically a new variant of influenza circulating that has mutated a little bit,\" says  Caitlin Rivers , an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. \"And that means that it's just different enough from what your body or the vaccine may recognize that it can kind of get around those protections.\" And she says the flu shot this year \"may not be as good a match as if we hadn't seen this new variant.\" That said, data from the U.K. indicates the vaccines still make a difference, Rivers says. In the U.K., the vaccines appear to be about 70% to 75% protective against hospitalization in children and about 30% to 40% protective against hospitalization in adults. So Rivers and others are urging anyone who hasn't already gotten a flu shot to get one. \"Definitely get it as soon as possible. Because activity is low right now. But it is increasing. And it will continue to increase straight through until we hit peak, which is usually around the holiday season. There's no sense in waiting when we are barreling into flu season,\" Rivers says. It takes about two weeks for immunity to kick in. And people don't want to catch or spread the flu over Thanksgiving. The flu kills between roughly 12,000 and 52,000 people in the U.S. every winter. \"I do have concerns that uptake of both the influenza and the annual COVID vaccine won't be as high this year as it had been in previous years,\" Rivers said. She is concerned by rhetoric coming from federal health officials questioning \"whether vaccines are safe and effective.\" \"We know that they are,\" she says. \"And they are important for protecting against severe illness. So it's really important that people go out and get them this year.\" In a written statement to NPR, a Health and Human Services spokesperson said: \"It is too early to know what viruses will spread this season, in what proportion, and how well the vaccine will work in the United States.\" The statement added: \"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Individuals should speak to their healthcare provider on the risks and benefits of a vaccine.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5612509","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:59:00-05:00","title":"Teens and former child actors weigh in online after Megyn Kelly comments","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After Megyn Kelly suggested on her podcast that Jeffrey Epstein was only interested in 'barely legal' 15-year-old girls—implying he wasn't a pedophile—former child actors, teenage girls, and survivors of abuse responded with strong public criticism.

In a  discussion  with NewsNation host Batya Ungar-Sargon on \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" on Nov. 12, Kelly stated that she knows \"somebody very close to this case\" who \"told me from the start [...] that Jeffrey Epstein, in this person's view, was not a pedophile.\" \"He was into the barely legal type, like, he liked 15-year-old girls,\" Kelly continued. \"I'm not trying to make an excuse for this, I'm just giving you facts — that he wasn't into, like, 8-year-olds.

NPR will update this story if we receive a response from Kelly. Women and girls react to Kelly online Many on social media were prompted to insist that 15 year olds are children. Actress and activist Cynthia Nixon weighed in on  Instagram : \"Megyn Kelly, I have a question for you, from one mother to another,\" she said. \"If Jeffrey Epstein were still alive, would you be comfortable with your teenage daughter being alone with him in his mansion? [...] And please, don't say 15 is barely legal. It is 100% illegal, and you know that.\" She was joined by celebrities who were former child actors, like Christina Ricci. On her Instagram story, Ricci posted, \"This woman is a danger to children.\" That Instagram story has since expired and is no longer online. Valerie Bertinelli, who starred in the sitcom  One Day at a Time,   shared  a picture of herself at 15, with the caption: \"This picture was taken in 1975. I'm 15. I'm a child. I'm gonna say this a little louder for those in the back row. I'm FIFTEEN. I'M A CHILD.\" She ended with a call to action, encouraging others to \"flood the Internet with pictures of all of us at 15.\" The Hollywood actresses were joined by actual teenagers, including a girl who posted a  TikTok video  from an account called @cheeringforchange and said her name is Eloise and that she is 14 years old. She said she wanted to respond to Kelly's comments with a \"reality check from a literal child.\" \"The minute adults start defending predators by debating the age of a child, you're not protecting the truth.

On Tuesday, eight of them posted a \" national PSA ,\" which called for the release of all of the Epstein files. This was done in partnership with  World Without Exploitation , a national coalition of organizations working to end human trafficking. After showing photos of the women at ages 14 to 17, the video ends with a call for justice: \"It's time to bring the secrets out of the shadows. It's time to shine a light into the darkness.\" On World Without Exploitation's website, it urges Americans to call on members of Congress to vote for the Epstein Files Transparency Act: \"By mandating the release of these files—while safeguarding the privacy of survivors—the legislation seeks to shed light on the enablers, co-conspirators, and institutional protections that allowed Epstein's operation to flourish. It aims to close loopholes that obstruct justice and ensure that no one, regardless of wealth or power, is above the law.\" The response to Kelly's comments preceded the  nearly unanimous vote in the House of Representatives  to publicly release the full slate of the Department of Justice files on Epstein's child sex trafficking. The President,  in a reversal of position , had previously stated he would sign it if it passed the House and Senate.

If you've ever rented an apartment, bought a car or applied for a loan, you know what it is. It's a score that tells lenders how financially reliable you are and how good you are at paying off your debts. But it's so much more than that, too.  There are rules to the credit score game. They're just not so easy to find.  \"It really is a game of the less you know, the more the person that you owe can earn from you,\" says  Tiffany Aliche, also known as the Budgetnista.   For example, you've probably heard conflicting advice when it comes to your credit, like: You should pay off your credit card in full each month. And then, no, you shouldn't pay off your card in full each month, it's good to leave a little balance. Aliche says there are all kinds of mixed messages on purpose.   \"It's not in a creditor's best interest for you to know how to play the game, because if you know how to play the game, then they don't make any money,\" Aliche says.  But thankfully, Aliche says the rules aren't that hard to follow once you know what they are. Out of all the basic financial tenets (debt, budgeting, investing, insurance) Aliche says credit is the easiest to manipulate.  First, we give you some tricks and tips to boost your credit score. Then we'll give you a basic breakdown of how credit scores work.  \n       \n      Related Story:  'Tis The Season: Coping With SAD, Or Seasonal Affective Disorder \n       What is considered a good credit score?  There are lots of credit score calculators, but Aliche recommends focusing on your FICO score. \"If you have a decent FICO score, which is the typical score most lenders use, then your [other] scores will probably be good no matter what credit score system someone's using,\" she says. \"The FICO score ranges from 300, which is an F minus, minus, minus to 850, which is A plus, plus, plus, plus.\" And she says there's no point in trying to achieve an 850 if your score is 740 or above. \"You're likely to get a yes on most things that you ask for when it comes to your credit once you hit 740,\" she says. How can I improve my credit score? If you have no credit, little credit or bad credit, a parent, friend or family member (who pays their bills on time and has good credit) can do something to boost your credit score. They can add you to their credit card as an authorized user ... and you will inherit their good credit from that card.   \"Yes, you can inherit the good behavior, but you can also inherit the bad. So you want to make sure that you are an authorized user on someone who pays off every month in full,\" Aliche said.  This is Aliche's main credit score hack. \"Really the point of an authorized user was to give younger folks access to a card that they would not normally have access to. But we're not using it like that. We're just using it to boost their credit score.\"  Aliche's dad actually did this for her. If you want to add someone on as an authorized user, call your bank or credit card company  and ask to add an authorized user onto your credit card. Technically, you can give this authorized user access to your physical credit card, but Aliche recommends you not do that. Just add them as a user — with no card — to boost their credit score.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Your Technology Is Tracking You. Take These Steps For Better Online Privacy \n       Never get too close to your credit card spending limit Let's say your credit card company tells you you can have a credit card with a $100 spending limit. That's how much money you can borrow and spend. But ... you actually shouldn't spend that full amount. You shouldn't get even close to your $100 limit. You should spend much less. Just 30% of your spending limit, so $30.  If your credit card limit is $1,000, you can spend $300. If you spend more than 30% of your limit, that hurts your credit. So if you have a good credit score and you want to maintain it, spending 30% of your credit card limit is fine. If you have a $100 credit card limit and you only spend $30 each month, that keeps you at 30% utilization of your card, and the credit score people like that.  If you want to increase your credit score, though, you need to spend less than 30% of your spending limit. Only use $20 of your credit card limit. Or $15 (if your limit is $100). That shows the credit bureau that you don't need all of their credit. And for some reason, that makes your credit score go up.  If you do need to use your full credit card limit, one way to get around this is to pay your balance before your statement date. Your statement date is different from your payment due date. The statement date is the day that credit card companies notify the credit bureaus of your card usage. If you can beat them to the punch and pay off the card before it's reported, you can use more than 30% of your spending limit.  It can sometimes be hard to find your statement date, though. Aliche recommends you call your bank or credit card company directly and ask them what the statement date is.  \n       \n      Related Story:  6 Tips For Making A Career Change, From Someone Who Has Done It \n       Is it better for your credit to pay off your credit card in full each month or keep a small balance? \"Paying off a debt in full every single month is like fairy dust on your credit score. It's like you paid off a mortgage. It's like you paid off a car,\" Aliche says. It doesn't matter how  big or small your balance is. The credit bureau just likes to see that you pay off your balance, in full, every month. It's the habit that counts.  You might have heard it's good to keep a small balance, but Aliche says that's a misconception.  \"Only the credit card companies want you to keep a balance, because if you don't keep a balance, what are they going to charge you? There's no fees when you pay off in full.\"  What about asking for a credit limit increase? Can you ask for it? Will that hurt your score? When you ask for a credit limit increase, Aliche says, the credit card company will either do a \"hard inquiry\" or a \"soft inquiry.\" A \"hard inquiry\" is when you give someone permission to \"to see all of your grades and then they make a decision whether they want to lend to you.\" That inquiry can impact your credit score.  Before you ask for an increase, ask your credit card company if it's a hard inquiry. If it is, you need to ask yourself if it's worth the potential credit score hit. There's no way to know if you'll be approved for the increase, Aliche says, but if you have strong credit (740 or above), you're more likely to be approved.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Spend Savvier, Save Smarter: 5 Tips To Stop Stress-Spending \n       Now, here's some credit score 101:  What is my credit score composed of?  The five components that make up your credit score are:  Payment history  (35% of your credit score): This is the most important part of your credit score. Basically, payment history means what it sounds like: Do you pay the people you owe on time? This applies to school loans, credit cards, etc.  Amounts Owed  (30% of your credit score): Think of this as your spending limit. (This is the credit utilization we talked about above). You never want your credit card balance to be more than 30% of your spending limit.  Aliche says credit card companies have this little trigger that says, \" 'Danger, danger, danger, she's using too much of her card. She must be in financial trauma and turmoil.' And so that's why they punish you by bringing down your score [if you spend more than 30% of your credit limit]. Because if your score is low, guess what? You can't qualify for more debt. You see, they're literally slowing you down.\" So 30% is a new 100%. Length of Credit History  (15% of your credit score): The longer you've had credit, the stronger this part of your credit score will be. Keep your oldest credit card open and pay off a small, recurring bill each month on it and you shouldn't have to worry much about this 15%. New Credit  (10%): Each time you open a new line of credit (think: applying for a loan or new credit card), this 10% of your score is affected. You can lose points just by applying for a new credit card, so make sure you don't apply for new credit unless you really need it. Buying a car or trying to get approved for a rental is probably worth it. But is that fourth credit card worth it? Maybe not.  Credit Mix  (10%): You don't need to do anything for this component. Lenders just like to see that you have a mix of credit such as revolving credit like a credit card, and some installment credit loans, like a mortgage. \"They just like to see that you have a mix,\" Aliche says. \"The longer you live, the more of a mix you'll have.\"  What is not included in my credit score? The credit bureaus don't take into account your job, your income, how much money you have saved, your marital status or if you have children.  When should I start building credit?  Start building credit when you know you can manage it effectively. Only take out credit if you know you won't abuse it. Aliche says she would much rather someone not take out credit than to severely abuse it. \"The abuse of it is way more detrimental\" than having a \"thin file.\" How many lines of credit should I have?  Typically, if you're looking to buy a home, Aliche says a bank will look for about three lines of credit. \"So I guess if there was a sweet spot, it's that: three lines of credit,\" she says.  So that would be like a car payment, a credit card and a student loan. That's three lines of credit. And if you have five lines of credit that's not bad, Aliche says.  \"It's not necessarily bad if you're managing them well,\" she says. \"To me, between three and 10 is probably best. But honestly, why do you need more than five?\" Where can I find my credit score?  Some people can find a credit score through their online banking portal. You can  get your FICO score here.  You can also find your score through one of the major credit reporting agencies:  Experian ,  TransUnion , and  Equifax .  You can expect to see slightly different scores  depending on where you look . Here's more information about  how to find your score . This piece originally published on November 10, 2020.

Usually, I'm with a different NPR podcast called Planet Money. We're an economics show, so we tell stories about, like, where credit cards came from or about the two brothers who basically created the credit score. It was in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1874. And today, I'm here with LIFE KIT to talk a little bit more about credit scores. We dig into some practical tips when it comes to our own financial situations 'cause our credit scores, they're not just something that tells lenders how reliable we are. It's a game. TIFFANY ALICHE: You actually don't have to be as disciplined with credit. You just have to know the rules of the game and play within them. So when someone says, I'm good at everything else, but my credit is a hot mess, I'm like, woo-hoo. That's excellent because that's the one that you actually don't have to be Michael Jordan. (SOUNDBITE OF PODINGTON BEAR'S \"DREAMLINER\") GONZALEZ: That is Tiffany Aliche, better known as the Budgetnista. She teaches people how to be smart with their money. And here's the thing about the game of credit - the rules are not so easy to find. Like, you have probably heard conflicting ideas when it comes to your credit. Like, pay off your credit card in full every month and then, no, don't pay off your credit card in full every month. Leave a little balance. They like it. Tiffany says there are all kinds of mixed messages on purpose. ALICHE: It's not in a creditor's best interest for you to know how to play the game because if you know how to play the game, then they don't make any money. It really is a game of the less you know, the more the person that you owe can earn from you. GONZALEZ: But thankfully, Tiffany says the rules aren't that hard to follow once you know what they are. Out of all the basic financial tenets - debt, budgeting, investing, insurance - Tiffany says credit is the easiest to manipulate. ALICHE: There are literally some tips and tricks and hacks that are totally legal that if you employ them, (laughter) your credit score can jump like Jordan. GONZALEZ: So let's get those credit scores up, people. In this episode of LIFE KIT, the real rules of the credit score game. Hopefully, after listening, you'll be able to start boosting your credit score or at the very least, you'll be able to look at your credit score and know why it's that number. (SOUNDBITE OF PODINGTON BEAR'S \"DREAMLINER\") GONZALEZ: So let's just start at the very beginning. What is a credit score? ALICHE: So your credit score is basically your GPA - remember high school and college, your grade point average - on your ability to pay someone back that you owe. Just like your GPA, it is an average. People will say, hey, Tiffany, if I pay off this credit card, what's my credit score going to be? And I always say, I don't know because it's like asking me, if I get an A in Spanish, what's my GPA going to be? I don't know because what did you get in Spanish last year? What did you get in math? What did you get in science? Do you see? It's a collection of your financial grades, especially those over the last two years. GONZALEZ: I got my first credit card when I was 26 years old - very, very late. And I just kept thinking that I was doing the responsible thing. I was spending the money that I had. I wasn't going over. I wasn't borrowing. I was just, like, so responsible. And then when I did finally get my first credit card, I very quickly realized the perks of having a credit card and how, like, not having a credit card for all those years was actually hurting me in a lot of ways. ALICHE: Well, I'll say this. I rather someone not take out credit than to severely abuse it because the abuse of it is way more detrimental than, hey, your credit score is a little thin, so we're going to have to have other ways for you to prove you can pay us back than someone who was like, I owe $300,000 in credit card debt. I don't even know what I bought. GONZALEZ: Right. ALICHE: Credit is not good or bad. Credit is a tool. Think about what a hammer is able to do, build and destroy. Credit can be used certainly to help to build your financial life. But you can just as easily destroy your financial life with credit. So you didn't really start late. You started when you were meant to. GONZALEZ: So if you don't have that much credit because you're young, only take out a credit card if you know you won't abuse it because, otherwise, it can really hurt you long term. When should you start building your credit, though? ALICHE: If you are fortunate that you have, say, a parent that is fairly responsible, you can start as young as, you know, 18 years old. A parent, a grandma can put you on as an authorized user. And so that's how I started my credit journey. My dad had a credit card that he paid off every month in full. He added me on as an authorized user. And authorized user just means I am authorizing that my daughter can also use the card, although he did not issue me the card, which is a good idea. But what it meant was that as he used the card responsibly, it looked like we both used the card responsibly. But the caveat is, if he was irresponsible, then it also looked like we're both irresponsible. GONZALEZ: Wow. I didn't realize you could just, like, inherit your parents'... ALICHE: Yes. GONZALEZ: ...Good credit history like that. ALICHE: But yes, you can inherit the good behavior, but you can also inherit the bad. So you want to make sure that you are an authorized user on someone who pays off every month in full. GONZALEZ: Wow. This is the hack. ALICHE: Yes. So we're using it in a hack-y (ph) way. But really, the point of an authorized user was to give kind of like younger folks access to a card that they would not normally have access to. But we're not using it like that. We're just using it to boost their credit score. So you could give them a card. But like I said, I don't suggest that. GONZALEZ: I mean, this is a way to just, like, hand it down. I'm going to add a bunch of people to my credit cards. (LAUGHTER) ALICHE: Just be mindful. GONZALEZ: OK, so this is - brings us to another good question, which is just, like, what is the best way to build your credit? If you are young and you're trying to build your credit, are there, like, one or two things that you should absolutely do or not do? Like, what is the best way to to build your credit? ALICHE: I'll say this. One, let's focus on your FICO score. There are so many scores. There's, like, the VantageScore, the this score. But if you have a decent FICO score, which is the typical score most lenders use, then your scores will probably be good no matter what credit score system someone's using. FICO score ranges from 300, which is an F-minus-minus-minus to 850, which is an A-plus-plus-plus-plus. And there are five components to your FICO score. Payment history is the biggest component, and that's 35%. Your payment history is, do you pay the people what they owe? Do you pay the minimum or more? So when you're paying off in full every single month, your credit history is really getting a boost. GONZALEZ: And is that just, like, a rule, like, always? Is it never good to keep a small balance? Do credit cards or credit bureaus not like that? I remember - I feel like I was taught that the credit bureaus like you to have a small balance. ALICHE: You know who likes you to have small balance and who put that out there? They're so good at marketing - the credit card companies. GONZALEZ: (Laughter). ALICHE: Little - oh, Sarah, just keep a little balance. Why? Because they want you to pay interest. It literally does not help to have a balance. If you can pay off your credit card in full every month, that's magical and amazing. Only the credit card companies want you to keep a balance because if you don't keep a balance, what are they going to charge you? There's no fees when you pay off in full. GONZALEZ: Wow, did they pull one over on us. ALICHE: Yes (laughter). GONZALEZ: OK, so payment history, that's one component of your credit score - it's 35% of it. Back to the other components. ALICHE: Another 10% of your credit score is credit mix. That just means that you have some revolving debt, some installment loans. They just like to see that you have a mix. You don't need to do anything for that component 'cause it's only 10%. It's just the longer you live, the more of a mixture you'll have naturally. Fifteen percent of your score is a length of credit history. I tell people, look; if you have a credit card that you've been paying off, especially every month in full, keep your oldest credit card open. The longer you've had credit, the stronger this part of your credit score will be because they just like to see that you've had some history behind this, so that's 15%. Ten percent - new credit. That means every time you open up or you apply for a loan or new credit card, that's 10% of your score is affected. You can lose points just by applying. You will almost likely lose points if you apply even if you get denied. So you want to save those losing-points opportunity for times when you really need the thing. You need - you want to - you really need a car, you really want to get that house, you really want to - I don't know - get that apartment and they have to run your credit score. Understandable. GONZALEZ: And here's the last big component of your credit score. ALICHE: Thirty percent is amounts owed. That's something called utilization. So what is your limit versus what is your balance? You never want your balance to be more than 30% of your limit. So if you have $100 limit on your card, you don't want to swipe more than $30. You don't want to have a balance of more than $30 on that card. So utilization is your credit cards collectively but also individually. GONZALEZ: OK, spending limits is a big one. This is basically, like, even though your credit card company saying, here, your spending limit is $100 - that's how much you can spend and can have and can borrow - you actually shouldn't borrow that full amount. You shouldn't get even close to the limit. You should borrow much less - 30%, as you said - because if you do spend close to your limit, if you spend 90 or 100, that hurts your credit. Why? Like, why do they do this to us? Why do they say, here's your limit, but don't get anywhere near it? ALICHE: Credit card companies have, like, this internal mechanism when they're like, oh, Sarah over here, she got 90% use on this card, another 90% here. They have this little trigger that says beep, beep - danger, danger, danger. She's using too much of her card; she must be in financial trauma, in turmoil. And so that's why they punish you by bringing down your score because if your score is low, guess what? You can't qualify for more debt. You see? They're literally slowing you down. It's the emergency brake for credit card companies and lenders. Thirty percent is a new 100% if you want to just maintain - like, my credit score's in the 800s, so I can have around 30 and be good. If you want to increase your score, you actually have to use less than 30%. You're looking at losing, like, 20%, 15%, 10%. GONZALEZ: Wow. So if you want to maintain your current decent credit score, you can use 30% of your credit card limit. If you want to try to get that number to go up, you want to use 20%, 10%, 15%, something like that. So $15 of your $100-spending limit? ALICHE: I know. And so there's some hacks to that. So let's just say, like, you're buying a couch. And you're like, I know I'm going to have - I get paid next week. And I'm going to put this $300 couch on my $500 card. Fine. Pay off that couch in full before the statement date. The statement date is the date that they tell the credit bureaus, hey, Sarah used her card. So if you can beat them to the punch and pay off the card before it's reported being used, then you can certainly use more than the 30%. Do understand? GONZALEZ: OK, what if you have your $100 spending limit and you use that full $100, but you pay off the full balance before your payment is due? ALICHE: Well, it's not just... GONZALEZ: Then, it doesn't affect your credit score? ALICHE: No, not necessarily because... GONZALEZ: (Laughter). ALICHE: ...If you just wait to the due date, the due date and the statement date are two separate dates. The due date is when your payment is due. The statement date is the day that they've told the credit bureaus, basically, Sarah used her card. GONZALEZ: Oh. ALICHE: So your due date might be, say, the 20, but the statement date might be, say, the 11. So... GONZALEZ: (Gasps). ALICHE: Yes. GONZALEZ: I had no idea that these dates were different. ALICHE: Yes. GONZALEZ: OK. ALICHE: So a statement date is the date that they are acknowledging you used your card. So if you could pay it off before the statement date, then they won't even know you used your card. GONZALEZ: It doesn't hurt you, but it also doesn't necessarily reward you either. ALICHE: Exactly. It won't - it will show - 'cause I remember that I was trying to show, look at me, I'm so good at paying off my card. So I put my Netflix on it, and then I paid it off. Like, I would - like, Netflix would charge me, say, the 15, and I would pay it off on the 16. And I remember my score wasn't moving. And I called. I was like, how come my score's not moving? She's like, 'cause you're paying it off so quickly that we never got a chance to say you used your card. I was like, oh. So I found out - let me pay - Netflix charges my card on the 15. My statement date is the 20. So I started paying it off on the 21. So it's like, tell the people I used my card then I paid it off. You see? So if you don't want them to know, pay it off before. If you do want them to know, pay it off after the statement date. But always, always, always by the due date. GONZALEZ: Oh. OK, OK, OK. So if you do want the credit bureau to know that you swiped your credit card, then you buy whatever you want to buy. You stay within your limit, or you, like, hit your limit, you pay it off before your statement date. ALICHE: Correct. GONZALEZ: But if you want to try to increase your credit score, you need to wait until at least a day after your statement date. ALICHE: Yes - because paying off a debt in full every single month is like fairy dust on your credit score. It's like you paid off a mortgage. It's like you paid off a car note. Even though it was only $25, the amount didn't matter. It's the habit. GONZALEZ: OK. I mean, can we talk about how unfair the credit score system is... ALICHE: Yeah. GONZALEZ: ...And can be? Like, I mean basically, a credit score is supposed to determine how trustworthy you are. But there's a long history of factoring in gender and race in a way that hurts people of color, Black people. Also, it's just like, you know, if you had parents who put you on to to their credit card... ALICHE: Yes. GONZALEZ: ...So that you could start establishing your credit history when you're 18 and 19 and 20 versus if you didn't. ALICHE: Yes. In so many neighborhoods that adhere to people of color, you will see, instead of banks, check-cashing places. And there is not this emphasis on credit, you know - or on building good credit. And there are predatory companies like Rent-A-Center. I remember they were sued because of their predatory practices against people of color in the neighborhoods that they lived in. I don't - I think people think, well, if you just would work harder - that's [expletive]. Sorry for my language - but not sorry. It's not just about working harder because we know that women are paid less. How much harder do women have to work? GONZALEZ: Mmm hmm, right. What about asking for a credit limit increase? Is it good? Is it bad? Does it hurt you? Does it help you to ask to increase your credit card limit? ALICHE: So when you ask for a credit card increase, it can be a hard inquiry. A hard inquiry is when you give someone permission to look at your credit to see if you are worthy - credit worthy to be lent to. You want to ask that beforehand. I want to inquire about getting a credit card increase. Is this a hard inquiry? Not every - it's not a hard inquiry for everyone. And so many times, it is. And so you have to ask yourself, is it worth the potential score hit? Now, here's the thing. They get to decide how much the increase is going to be. You could certainly request. And there's no way to know for certain that you're going to get a yes. If your credit score is decent - and the beginning of perfect credit is 740. So 740 or better and you're likely to get a yes on most things that you ask for when it comes to your credit. GONZALEZ: How many lines of credit should you have? Is there a sweet spot? Can you have too many credit cards? Can you have too little? ALICHE: Typically, if you're looking to buy a home, they're usually looking for about three lines of credit. So I guess if there was a sweet spot, it's that. GONZALEZ: Three lines of credit. So that would be, like, a car payment, a credit card, student loans. Does that count as three lines of credit? ALICHE: Absolutely. GONZALEZ: OK. And if you have, like, five, is that bad? ALICHE: It's not necessarily bad if you're managing them well. To me, between three and 10 is probably best. But honestly, what do you need more with five, if you ask me. GONZALEZ: Tiffany, oh, my gosh. It has been so awesome talking to you. Thank you for all of the tips. ALICHE: Thank you, Sarah, for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GONZALEZ: So let's recap. Here is what you need to remember. Credit isn't good or bad - it's a tool. And take credit out when you know you won't abuse it. There are five components to your credit score. ALICHE: New credit, 10%; length of credit history, 15%; credit mix, 10%; amounts owed, 30%; payment history, 35%. GONZALEZ: The beginning of perfect credit is 740. So if your credit score is 740 or above, you really don't need to worry about getting it any higher. You're basically perfect. If you want to raise your credit score, though, ask someone with good credit to add you on to their credit card. Just make sure that that person makes all of their payments on time, or it will hurt you. And if you can - this is the magical pixie dust - pay off your own credit card in full every month. ALICHE: After the statement date and before the due date. GONZALEZ: You should actually call your credit card company and ask them what the official statement date is because it's not often spelled out. And last but not least... ALICHE: Credit is mostly a game. And it is a game that you can win once you know the rules, and now you know the rules. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GONZALEZ: For more episodes of LIFE KIT, go to /lifekit.

The sale of the 1940 painting, called  El sueño (La cama) , is widely anticipated to set a record for the most expensive artwork made by a woman. \" El sueño  stands among Frida Kahlo's greatest masterworks — a rare and striking example of her most surrealist impulses,\" said Anna Di Stasi, Sotheby's head of Latin American art, in a statement. \"Kahlo fuses dream imagery and symbolic precision with unmatched emotional intensity, creating a work that is at once deeply personal and universally resonant.\" Sotheby's estimates that  El sueño (La cama)  will sell for between $40 and $60 million. The final price could easily outstrip the 2014 record set by Kahlo's friend and contemporary Georgia O'Keeffe, when O'Keeffe's 1932 work  Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1  sold at auction for $44.4 million. The last time Frida Kahlo broke an auction record was in 2021, when her 1949 work  Diego y yo  sold for $34.9 million; then the highest price for a Latin American artwork. It is also Kahlo's highest sale to date. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At a moment when art sales have dramatically softened,  museums face massive financial restructuring  and a number of leading galleries have shuttered, the buzz around this painting is significant but not surprising. Surrealist women artists are currently  in vogue among collectors , and Kahlo is among a small handful of superstar artists with a seemingly bulletproof brand — think Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Her mystique erupts in part from her psychologically complex self-portraits that focus on her disabilities, her politics, her heritage and her deep connection to the world shimmering around her. \"Her paintings tell stories — intimate, engaging, terrifying and tragic ones,\" wrote art historian Sharyn R. Udall in her 2003 article,  \"Frida Kahlo's Mexican Body: History, Identity and Artistic Aspiration,\"  published in  Woman's Art Journal.  \"When Kahlo looked into death's dark mirror, she saw herself. In the act of painting and in the resulting canvases, she documented her own attempts to survive pain, to make sense of it, to act out through images layered with irony, fantasy and allegory. Her work is searingly candid, overlaid with the unreality of an endless nightmare.\" And her work seems to only grow in power. Just within the past year, more than a dozen museums around the world exhibited shows dedicated to Kahlo. An  immersive experience  that brought audiences inside some of them has been traveling internationally. The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston will soon open a vast retrospective called  Frida: The Making of an Icon.  It's scheduled to transfer to the Tate Modern in London next June. And a new Frida Kahlo museum that explores the artist's early life opened in Kahlo's neighborhood in Mexico City in September. It's the third museum that centers Kahlo's life and art in the city. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1196979026","dateOfPublication":"2024-05-29","timeOfPublication":"20:45:30+08:00","title":"AI Ethics in the Age of Rapid Innovation: A Comprehensive Analysis","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing importance of AI ethics in the face of rapid technological advancement.

Negotiation skills aren't just for high-stakes situations like job offers and pay raises. They can be used in daily life, like figuring out where you and your friends should go on vacation or what you and your partner should cook for dinner tonight. They can also help you get what you want and make decisions with more confidence, says  Joan Moon , a career coach and the head of negotiation coaching at the Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Collaboratory at the Harvard Kennedy School. \"They can improve your satisfaction with your situation and give you a sense that you are making intentional choices.\"  Moon explains four classic negotiation tactics often used in business environments — and how they can be applied in everyday circumstances.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Oops, I messed up! 7 common public speaking issues — and how to fix them \n       The tactic: Benchmarking  How to use it in everyday life: When making big consumer choices, like hiring a contractor to renovate your kitchen, buying a car or purchasing a new washing machine.  How it works:  This strategy allows you to gather the information you need to make a fair decision. It's when you compare an offer to market standards and best practices, \"then figure out where you lie within that range\" to get an optimal deal. In business, people often use benchmarking in salary negotiations to ensure they're being paid equitably, says Moon.  The tactic: Win-win strategy  How to use it in everyday life: When you're trying to find a solution to a problem that makes everyone happy, like picking out a place to eat or haggling for a good price at a yard sale.  How it works:  This helps different parties find one solution that's in everyone's interest. You might see this in business contracts or labor agreements, for example. Parties won't sign until the terms are mutually beneficial.  Try this when you want the other party to not just agree with your decision, but feel good about it. Moon shares a recent personal experience. Her phone line was down so she called her phone company to get reconnected — but the customer service agents were unhelpful. She could feel herself getting upset, so she decided to reframe her request using a win-win strategy.  She said: \"Listen, I've been with this company for 10 years and I would like to keep doing so for another 10 years. Can we focus on a solution?\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  3 common thinking traps and how to avoid them, according to a Yale psychologist \n       The approach worked, she says. The company didn't want to lose a loyal customer — and Moon wanted her phone fixed.  The tactic: A menu of options   How to use it in everyday life: When you want to get something done and won't take no for an answer.  How it works:  This approach avoids requests that result in a flat-out no answer. People often use this tactic when negotiating the benefits of a job offer, says Moon. For example, instead of asking for more flexibility at a new job and getting rejected, you might propose a couple of options: working three days remote or a four-day workweek, expanding the possibility of a favorable outcome.   Offer \"a menu of options\" to someone if they think only one solution is possible. Let's say you're upset with your roommate for being messy, says Moon. Instead of asking them to clean up (which they haven't been doing), give them choices: hire a housekeeper, change the breakdown of responsibilities at home or adjust the cleaning schedule. \"When you present options, it signals to the other person: let's solve this problem together,\" says Moon.  \n       \n      Related Story:  The rules of improv can make you funnier. They can also make you more confident. \n       The tactic: Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement  How to use it in everyday life: When you know you're not likely going to get the outcome you want, so you create a plan that helps you avoid a total-lose situation. For example, when you're planning a trip with friends who want to go on a tropical vacation, but you want to go to a big city. Maybe you settle on Miami!  How it works:  Negotiators use  BATNA  to come up with a backup plan when their desired outcome isn't possible. It helps avoid a total win-lose situation and shows the person you're negotiating with that you have a strong alternative, which can increase your leverage in a situation. You might use BATNA when comparing job offers with unfavorable conditions. For example, one job requires you to relocate your family to another state, while the other job pays less but is local. Your BATNA might be to tell both jobs that you will stay at your current gig and unless they can offer something better.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. Hey everybody, it's Marielle. When was the last time you negotiated something? Not your salary, though. Well, think about it this way. Have you ever compromised with a friend or a housemate, partner or family member? If so, you have done some form of negotiation, whether it was over who's going to do the dishes, what you were having for dinner or where you were going to go on vacation together. JOAN MOON: I had some friends the other day, a couple deciding on what - (laughter) what ice cream flavors that they were going to get from the grocery store. SEGARRA: That's Joan Moon, founder of Moon Negotiation, a negotiation and career coaching firm. She's also the head of negotiation coaching at the Harvard Kennedy School. And she says, yeah, some negotiations are much higher stakes than others. But the point is, negotiating can help you come up with compromises, creative solutions that go beyond yes or no, this or that, and that can help you get unstuck. MOON: It can really improve your everyday contentment, your satisfaction with your situation, and it can really give you a sense of agency. It gives you a sense that you are making intentional choices and creating a life for yourself, curating a life for yourself that you're happy with. SEGARRA: On this episode of LIFE KIT, Joan and I are going to walk through some of the negotiation strategies that you might typically use when you get a job offer or a promotion, and talk about how you can apply those in your day-to-day lives. Well, let's get into some of the formal negotiation tactics that you can use in these everyday situations. There is a term that's going to come up here - benchmarking. What is that? MOON: Yeah. So what we do in, let's say, a job offer or a salary negotiation is we benchmark on, like, what is an appropriate range for this job. We might look at what the industry standards are, what the organizational standards are. Might do some research on the fair market value. And then using my level of experience, I'll figure out where I lie within that range. In the personal context, you can continue to use those benchmarking strategies, let's say, when you're making, like, large consumer choices. So if you're hiring a plumber or you want to do a kitchen renovation. Or other times you might do some benchmarking is buying a car, right? So what you're doing is you're researching good information and what is an appropriate price point for this purchase. And it's really important to reduce ambiguity and uncertainty in these situations by investigating. When you investigate, I go with APP. So A is ask, P is to think of people resources and the other P is to think of paper resources. So you had a delayed flight, and you know that there are certain regulations that airlines have to follow. You might be able to just ask at the customer service counter, and they might give you the information you're looking for. For people resources - so people resources might be just asking around within your networks. You can go into informal groups like a Facebook group. You can reduce the ambiguity by investigating using the APP model. SEGARRA: It sounds like benchmarking works really well for negotiations in the office and then also on things that you're buying. Stuff around money. MOON: Yeah. SEGARRA: Let's talk about another phrase. What about win-win strategies? MOON: Yeah. Most people have heard of, like, a win-win in passing, but the issue is that a lot of us are not utilizing the strategy as frequently as we have the opportunity to. So, a win-win is when you talk about how you and I are both going to benefit from the solution. So let me give you an example. I was on a customer service call recently, and I was having issues with my phone service, and I was in a really tight spot. I basically had no phone service. My phone number wasn't working. So I called customer service and I said, you know, you told me to do this thing and that if I did that, this situation would be fixed. The new customer service rep I was talking to said, well, you know, we don't have any record of us telling you that we told you to do that. And I was incredibly upset because, A, you're gaslighting me right now. B, you literally have a recording of this call and you can look it up. Like, what is the point of this, right? So I was sitting there fuming that that is the direction of the conversation that we went in. And so I said, OK, Joan, you know the research on this. Let's utilize this win-win framing strategy. And so I redirected the conversation saying, listen, I want to remain a long-time satisfied customer at this company. I've been with you for 10 years, and I would like to keep it for another 10 years. And so what I'm doing is I'm speaking to their interests and to mine. Right? We both want to benefit from this relationship. So I said, can we focus on a solution to how I can get my phone reconnected? And with this, we were able to focus on solutions instead of focusing on the past and whether or not they told me that, you know, because that was not going to be a productive conversation. So we focused on what do we both want in this situation and how do we benefit from that. SEGARRA: You've also talked about when, you're in the midst of negotiating, giving people a menu of options. What does that mean? MOON: In going to a housekeeping example - right? - let's say you're upset with your roommate on people not cleaning up around the apartment and, you know, it's getting pretty filthy. And, you know, I've gotten so busy with work, so I can't keep on doing the majority of the housework. So what I would recommend is come up with three different options. Let's say maybe we come up with a different cleaning schedule that is a little bit more accommodating of our lifestyles. Or maybe we change the breakdown of responsibilities within the home. Or maybe we look up prices of housekeeping services. When you present three different options, it's less of a standoff, and it signals to the other person a collaborative tone - like, let's solve this problem together. SEGARRA: Yeah. And I know, you know, on the one hand, if you're the one bringing this up, like, then maybe it is on you to come up with some solutions. But is it ever frustrating, though, to be the person who is like, and here it is, here's a menu of things you could choose from... MOON: (Laughter). SEGARRA: ...And it just feels like the other person is not doing any of the work? MOON: Yeah. Yeah, so I do not promise that this will be a frustration-free process, right? And when someone is being incredibly, you know, stubborn or difficult, that's when I recommend reconsidering what we call in the negotiation community, your BATNA. And that stands for best alternative to negotiated agreement. And what that means is if you're unable to negotiate with this person, what are you going to walk away to? What is your alternative? SEGARRA: What's your backup plan? MOON: Yeah, exactly. And if you have a really bad backup plan that you're not really willing to consider, then you're going to feel stuck, and then you're going to get upset with the other person for not engaging in these options. You're going to feel like you're stuck in a corner. And so what we always recommend in negotiating is to strengthen your BATNA - have a really good alternative. When you increase and improve upon your alternatives, you're able to think with a clearer head, and you're less likely to make a decision that you regret later on. SEGARRA: I wonder, is it important for the other person to have a sense of your BATNA, like, especially if you've firmed it up or if you are willing to walk away? If you're willing to move out or leave your job or, you know, break up with your partner... MOON: (Laughter) Yeah. SEGARRA: ...or whatever, like, is it good for them to know that? Should you communicate that with them in the negotiation? MOON: That's a really great question. Yes, absolutely. And I want to be super clear. You do want to signal to them subtly that you do have a strong BATNA so that they are aware of, you know, how fed up you might be. Oftentimes, people are so involved in their own lives, and what you're bringing up to them might not be a big priority for them. But it might become a higher priority when they realize, oh, my gosh, I didn't realize you were so upset about this. I didn't realize that you were at the breaking point when it comes to this. And so when you are able to subtly signal, like, listen, I'm close to my breaking point here, then they are going to prioritize the requests that you are making to them. SEGARRA: Or not. And then you... MOON: (Laughter) Yes. SEGARRA: And then you, you know, make another choice. Then you maybe... MOON: Absolutely. SEGARRA: ...Fall back on your backup plan. I mean, if your BATNA, like we talked about, best alternative to a negotiated agreement, is real - like, if you really feel that, then you will embody that, I think, when you're in the room, and you won't be coming from a desperate place. MOON: Actually, Marielle, there's research that shows exactly what you're saying, right? So there's research that shows that when you have a strong BATNA, it influences your negotiation performance. If you don't have a strong BATNA, it impacts the way that you engage in the negotiation and the sort of feeling like you're in a corner, you don't have any other options. That kind of subtly bleeds through to the other person, and so you end up getting a worse negotiating outcome. So having a strong BATNA is good for multiple reasons, the first one being that you have alternatives if this doesn't work out, but the second reason is that it puts you in a healthy and strong psychological place as you enter into that conversation. SEGARRA: Yeah. So you're not coming in as a supplicant? MOON: Yes. Exactly. SEGARRA: Let's talk about some other examples of how we can negotiate in our day-to-day lives. Like, what are some other negotiations that might come up, for instance, with a romantic partner? MOON: So one example that I think will feel really relatable for folks is I had a client, I'm going to call her Anna, and Anna was negotiating with her fiance over the details of their wedding. And, you know, he wasn't super invested in the details at first. You know, he was like, oh, yeah, whatever you want. Oh, that sounds like a great idea. Sounds good. Let's do that. But there was a shift at a certain point where he started being a little bit more demanding and rigid on some of the details that he previously didn't care about. So when she dug a little deeper, she found out that it was actually his mother who had some expectations. SEGARRA: How did I know you were going to say that? (LAUGHTER) MOON: It's such a classic... SEGARRA: How did I know, Joan? MOON: ...Story, right? Such a classic story. So - sorry to give such a heteronormative example, too. So what happened is the mother had been dreaming about - this is her eldest son. She'd been dreaming about this wedding for so long, and she also had certain cultural expectations, right? Anna and her fiance, they were coming from two different cultural backgrounds, and in addition to that, there was a language barrier. She couldn't communicate effectively directly with the mother. And I use this example to talk about the different parties involved in a negotiation. I call them the PDMs. The P is a power broker, the D is a decision-maker, and the M is a messenger. Now, normally you would think that Anna and her fiance are the decision-makers, but as she dug deeper, she realized that he was actually just kind of a messenger and the mother was being the decision-maker. So what she did in this situation was appeal to the father-in-law, who was a power broker. He's the one who could sort of influence his wife and say, listen, you know, it's her wedding, too. Maybe, you know, she doesn't understand why this is of cultural significance to you. Maybe you should explain this. And so he was able to influence her a little bit more. And this scenario is to point out that there are often invisible parties in a negotiation. Oftentimes, you're not just negotiating with the person in the room, so really thinking about who are the actual parties involved and who are the power brokers, decision-makers and the messengers can be important in how you direct your energy during a negotiation. SEGARRA: That's so smart, and it also is annoying. MOON: (Laughter) Yeah. SEGARRA: It's just like, what if you don't want to have a decision-maker outside of the people that you thought were decision-makers in your romantic relationship? MOON: Absolutely. And I think that's a conversation between Anna and her fiance, right? Like, hey, let's talk about whose wedding this is. Let's talk about what kind of decisions we're OK with delegating to family members and what decisions that we need to make between ourselves. And that's a negotiation in itself. SEGARRA: Yeah. What are some things you might negotiate with friends, besides housework, if you're roommates? MOON: So I have an example of two friends who were having an argument or a disagreement. One friend was sort of feeling undervalued and kind of ignored by the other friend. You know, maybe they weren't responding to their texts as frequently, when they were in group settings, they weren't really prioritizing time with them, and so in this situation, she was debating on, like, how do I approach this conversation? It's like, first of all, let's go back to the shared interests example, right? I care about our relationship, and I want us to have a healthy friendship, and so starting off the conversation with that sets a collaborative tone. Another thing to think about as you engage in negotiating or engaging in conflict resolution is something I borrowed from Alcoholics Anonymous. It's called HALT - hungry, angry, lonely or tired. Anytime you're feeling any of these things, it's probably a bad time to engage in this conversation. We really want to be mindful about the timing and context of a situation, and is that the ideal scenario in which we're going to engage in a conversation that's really important to us? So being really intentional about not only is the timing and context right for you, but is it the right timing and context for the other person and being really thoughtful about them, and that sets you up to have a more productive and successful conversation. SEGARRA: Yeah. OK. Broadly speaking, how do you know when it's time to step away from a negotiation? MOON: Oh, I get this question a lot, actually. So one major factor to consider is the strength and the longevity of a relationship. And let's say if you are haggling over the price of a souvenir and you're never going to see this vendor again, you might want to cut your losses and walk away. If this is a long-standing relationship that you really value and you really want to maintain, you want to make sure that how you negotiate and how frequently you negotiate isn't wearing out or fatiguing that relationship. You know, you want to consider, like, am I overfatiguing this relationship? Am I overplaying my hand? And do I need to sort of accept the no or not right now and walk away from this situation to my BATNA? SEGARRA: Yeah. What would you say to someone who's nervous about looking demanding or even greedy when they negotiate? MOON: This brings me back to the strategy of benchmarking because when you benchmark and you realize that what you're asking for is completely within the norm, then what you've done is you've built yourself an armor against a reaction like that. And you're also - once you have that data and you present that data to the other person, you reduce the likelihood that they're going to respond that way because you have objective data, right? You have all these numbers that you've researched, and it's kind of hard to react that way when there's such clear data in front of you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: That was Joan Moon from Moon Negotiation. Now, instead of doing a traditional recap, let's go over the terms and acronyms Joan introduced us to. Basically, this is a glossary. First, we've got benchmarking. MOON: So benchmarking is when you do some research to see what are the standards out there, what other objective data that you can collect to legitimize what you're asking for. SEGARRA: Next up, we have the acronym APP. MOON: APP is three different areas in how you can investigate and reduce ambiguity. So the A stands for ask, whether that's directly or indirectly. The first P is for people resources, and then there's paper resources. SEGARRA: And these don't literally have to be on paper. You know, this could mean doing your research by looking up a policy or digging through an online forum. Next, Joan talked to us about win-win strategies. MOON: A win-win strategy is when you highlight what you're asking for can benefit both parties, whether it's you and the other person or you and your employer. SEGARRA: Another negotiation tactic Joan mentioned - giving people a menu of options. MOON: A menu of options is a way to stay away from yes-or-no requests and instead to present three different creative choices so that it increases the likelihood of the other person agreeing on one of those options. SEGARRA: All right, another acronym coming your way - BATNA. That's B-A-T-N-A. MOON: The BATNA is the best alternative to negotiated agreement. And this is, you know, if your negotiation doesn't work out, what are you going to walk away to? What is your best alternative in this scenario? SEGARRA: Next, we've got PDMs. MOON: The PDMs are the power brokers, decision-makers and the messengers. There are three different types of parties that you might be negotiating with, whether they're in the room with you or outside of the room. SEGARRA: And our last acronym - HALT. H-A-L-T. MOON: HALT stands for hungry, angry, lonely and tired. And basically you want to halt when you are feeling any of these things because it's likely not the best time to engage in a negotiation conversation. SEGARRA: All right, Joan, thank you so much for being here. MOON: Thank you, Marielle, for having me. I'm a big fan of the show. SEGARRA: I'm a big fan of yours now.

Greg Abbott has quickly appealed to the Supreme Court a ruling that the redistricting passed by lawmakers at the urging of President Trump was based on racial gerrymandering. \"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\" A three-judge panel had earlier Tuesday placed a temporary block on the map that Republican lawmakers passed this summer and ordered the state to use the district maps from the last two elections. The map that was overruled had been drawn to give Republicans an advantage in flipping as many as five House seats held by Democrats.  \"To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map,\" wrote the majority from a three-judge panel. The panel  heard a trial   on the case  in October. The plaintiffs included several civil rights groups and individuals. The ruling is a blow to Trump and the Republicans in a  nationwide redistricting race  that  began in Texas  this summer. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, also said he would appeal the ruling on the \"Big Beautiful Map\" which he called \"entirely legal\" in a statement. Democrats praised the court ruling. \"Race was always a driving factor and a driving factor to make it harder for minority Texans,\" said Texas Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher in an interview. \"This map was drawn to make it harder for them to have an impact in elections.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The court's decision, in a 2-1 ruling, comes at a pivotal moment. Around the country, Trump is pressing Republican state lawmakers to reshape congressional voting maps to hold the party's slim majority in the House and support his agenda. Using their heavy Republican majority in the legislature, Texas lawmakers passed a map in August designed to help their party grow its ranks in the 2026 elections for the U.S. House. The process gained national attention when Democrats in the legislature  fled the state for over  two weeks to delay a vote and Republican leaders threatened to arrest them. Democrats argued the new map weakened the voting power of Latino and Black communities. The redistricting in Texas also prompted California Democrats to act. This month  California voters passed  an initiative allowing redistricting that could help Democrats win five seats in that state. Was it partisan gerrymandering or racial gerrymandering?  Republicans in the Texas Legislature  passed the map saying  it was designed to improve their party's chances of winning five congressional seats. They noted that, unlike in some states, the law in Texas does not prohibit redistricting for partisan advantage and that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal courts could not intervene when it's done. But partisan gerrymandering can often overlap with racial gerrymandering, which is illegal. Opponents of the map argued in court  that it intentionally diminished  the voting power of minority communities.  The 160-page opinion was written by District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown, who was appointed by Trump during his first term as president. His ruling drew upon statements and contradictions in what Republican lawmakers said as the maps were passed. A letter the Department of Justice wrote to encourage the redistricting, ended up being grounds the court used to block the effort. The judges noted that when Gov. Abbott originally called lawmakers into session to draw the map,  he cited a letter from justice department  officials criticizing districts that had majority non-white voting populations as \"racial gerrymanders.\" In other words, the letter implied the districts as they stood gave non-white voters an advantage and that had to be reversed. Eventually, Texas Republicans said the map was not intended to correct for a racial tilt but for partisan gain. That letter put lawmakers, who for years had denied their use of race when making maps, in \"a difficult spot\" according to University of Texas at Austin political scientist Josh Blank, because they were \"ultimately saying opposite things.\" Brown's ruling criticized the construction of the letter itself, which was sent by Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division. \"It's challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors,\" Brown wrote. \"This decision is a rebuke of Donald Trump and to some degree a rebuke of lawmakers in Texas,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist with the University of Houston. \"They think the process was flawed and the Department of Justice was not credible in their legal arguments.\" Rep. Gene Wu, Democratic leader in the Texas House, said Tuesday's ruling shows the courts still hold true to American principles. \"The striking down of the maps is fundamentally a sign that the courts still believe in the core principles of this country: That one man, one vote idea is something that is absolute and must be kept up,\" Wu said. Around the country,  Republicans have more options for redistricting  seats their way than Democrats do, in part because the GOP controls more state legislatures. Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade after the national census. At the behest of Trump, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina passed new maps that could help the GOP win a seat in each state. Ohio drew a map that analysts say gives Republicans a slight advantage in a few seats. For Democrats, in addition to the five seats that could be gained in California, a court-ordered redistricting in Utah could help Democrats win a seat there. And Virginia Democrats have started a process that could yield two seats in that state. Blaise Gainey  covers state politics for The Texas Newsroom.

\"Low.\" But musicians don't just sing about jeans. They also live in them. And those garments sometimes reveal intriguing details about the people who wear them, as the new  Amped: Music Icons in Levi's Denim  exhibition at Levi's headquarters in San Francisco shows. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       One of the exhibition's marquee items is a pair of Levi's 501s once owned by Kurt Cobain. The late Nirvana frontman's jeans set a  Guinness World Record  in 2023 when they sold for more than $412,750 at a Nashville  auction . Tracey Panek was there. \"I was bidding on it,\" Levi's in-house historian and archivist told NPR. \"But sadly one of my rivals got it.\" \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The winning bidder, private collector Tom Coyne, agreed to loan the jeans to Levi's for the exhibition. Cobain wore them on many occasions during the 1990s, including on the  video  for \"Heart-Shaped Box.\" They show a lot of wear. There are heavy stains, rips and patches, including a colorful psychedelic print lining the hem. \"They're just a signature grunge-looking pair of jeans,\" Panek said. The pants also tell more subtle stories. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Panek points to faded, upside-down lettering on the right leg — a four-letter word beginning with F — scribbled on a patch. While the artist was famously a left-handed guitarist, Panek said the scrawl suggests Cobain was actually ambidextrous. \"You can tell he was writing with his right hand while he was seated,\" she said. Other pieces in the exhibition offer very different portraits of their famous owners. The sharp creases in a pair of slim-fitting, light blue jeans once owned by Freddie Mercury say something about the Queen vocalist's fastidiousness. \"I think he ironed these,\" Panek said. Meanwhile a rhinestone-festooned, western-style denim pants and matching jacket worn by Beyoncé in a recent Levi's advertising campaign highlight Queen Bey's penchant as a performer for upending traditional white, male tropes. \"She challenges a pool shark to a shootout,\" said Panek, describing one of the  ads  set to Beyoncé's 2024 song \"Levii's Jeans.\" \"Of course, she wins hands down, and demands that her rival give up his Levi's.\" Mary Davis, a fashion historian and musicologist at Yale University, said musicians use denim in many different ways to construct identity and share messages. \"There's a way in which you can see denim being almost a blank canvas for anything that anybody wants to make it,\" Davis said. Davis points to Bruce Springsteen's 1984 album  Born in the U.S.A. , with its songs about the struggles of the working class – and its memorable album cover. It shows Springsteen from behind in worn blue Levi's, a white T-shirt and a red baseball cap stuffed into a back pocket. Davis said the photograph draws a potent line between denim's 19th century workwear roots and the troubadour of late twentieth century labor. \"He's making a statement there,\" Davis said.

To figure out your post-breakup dynamic, “really check in with yourself” about what you want the next phase of your relationship to look like, says therapist  Xavier Patschke , a psychotherapist with the Gender and Sexuality Therapy Center in New York. Patschke and Franco share three questions to ask yourself before building a platonic connection with a former romantic partner. Question 1: Why do I want to stay in touch with my ex? There are many practical reasons why former partners choose to stay in each other’s lives, say Franco and Patschke. Perhaps you share kids or pets together and need to maintain a civil relationship. Maybe you’re part of the same friend group or small community and know you’ll run into each other. Or maybe you were friends before you started dating and want to continue that friendship. Whatever the reason, be honest about your intentions. “You might realize you don’t actually want to be friends with them because they don’t look like the people you tend to want in your life platonically,” says Franco. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Question 2: Am I in a healthy place to stay in touch with my ex? If you’re reaching out to your ex because you still desire them and are hoping to get back together, “wait until those feelings subside,” says Franco. Same goes for if you’re struggling to accept the breakup and feel desperate to keep your former partner in your life, she says. You don’t want to treat friendship as a consolation prize. Franco knows that’s easier said than done. “It can feel like such a loss [for a partner] to go from one of the closest people in your world to not talking to them at all.” But keep in mind: it can be harder to get over your ex if you remain friends,  according to a study on post-breakup friendships . “You’re more likely to desire your ex romantically, and they’re more likely to desire you,” says Franco. So make sure you’re both ready for that next step. You’ll know you’ve reached an appropriate level of emotional distance when you want your ex to be happy regardless of whether or not their life includes you, says Franco. Question 3: What do I want a platonic relationship with my ex to look like? There’s a range of possibilities, says Franco. Do you want a close friendship that involves asking each other for dating advice? Does an occasional check-in feel more appropriate? Or would you settle on just being polite when you run into each other unexpectedly? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If there’s a mismatch between what you both want, respect the boundaries of the person who wants less intimacy. Just like a romantic relationship, you can’t force a connection. And if you’re not sure what’s appropriate, you can test out different levels of friendship. “It’s OK for the boundary to start at, ‘I don’t know if I want to hear about your future dates,’ “ says Patschke. “ ‘But we’ll try it and we’ll check in again.’ “ “The nice thing about being friends with anyone, including your ex, is that you can decide how close you want the friendship to be,” says Franco. “It’s not like romantic relationships where it’s very all or none.” We want to hear from you: Are you still friends with your ex?

In his second term, Trump has continued to push the boundaries of military involvement in domestic matters, whether it comes to addressing public safety, quelling protests or safeguarding federal buildings and personnel, including ICE agents. In response, local and state Democratic leaders have forcefully pushed back and made strides in the courts, where judges have deemed the use of military force as unnecessary or unlawful. Some judges have also expressed wariness around having the military get involved in civilian affairs. \"This principle has been foundational to the safeguarding of our fundamental liberties under the Constitution,\" U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut wrote in her ruling freezing Trump's deployment to Portland, Ore. earlier this month. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The latest court to push back was in Tennessee, where a judge temporarily blocked the state's use of the Guard in Memphis. That deployment was ordered by the governor at the behest of Trump. As the legal challenges mount, the Defense Department over the weekend ordered hundreds of troops in Chicago and Portland to return to their home states after federal courts stalled deployments,  NPR previously reported . Some legal and military experts view the recent events as minor setbacks for the Trump administration. But others see the court decisions as proof of checks and balances at work, at least to some degree. \"There's a pretty common theme that deploying the military into U.S. cities is not something that can be done lawlessly,\" said David Janovsky, a senior policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group. \"It is a good sign that the courts are standing up and saying that.\" Breaking down the Memphis ruling  In Tennessee, a group of Democratic lawmakers and officials filed a lawsuit against Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others, challenging the deployment of the state's National Guard. The plaintiffs argued that Memphis did not face a \"rebellion or invasion,\" which was the criteria for sending the Guard under the state's constitution. Unlike the governors of Illinois, Oregon and California, who have opposed Trump's deployment of Guard forces, the governor of Tennessee approved and directed the deployment in Memphis.  Still, on Monday, Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal sided with the plaintiffs. In her opinion, she wrote, \"The power committed to the Governor as commander-in-chief of the Army and Militia is not unfettered.\" Benjamin R. Farley, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, which   was part of a coalition that provided legal representation to the plaintiffs,   said Moskal's ruling showed that the Tennessee governor does not have blanket authority to deploy troops.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's one more victory in a line of victories for the law against executive overreach, whether that's the president or as is the case here, the governor of Tennessee,\" he said. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NPR that the administration disagreed with the ruling. \"This state court judge fundamentally misunderstood the law and is attempting to act as a policy-maker, not a judge,\" she said in an email. Now, it's important to note that the pause on the deployment has not taken effect, as the chancellor gave the state a few days to appeal. If state officials choose to appeal, they may request that the Guard operations be allowed to continue until the appellate court reaches a decision. Lee's office did not immediately comment.  Janovsky from the Project on Government Oversight said that's one way the courts tend to fall short. \"That sort of misreads the stakes of the situation,\" he said. \"If it is presumptively illegal to have troops on the streets, it seems completely backwards to let the troops stay on the street until there's a final determination.\" As federal courts block troop deployments, will SCOTUS have final say? A Defense Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that the holidays may have influenced the decision to  withdraw out-of-state troops from Illinois and Oregon  in the coming days. But retired Maj. Gen. William Enyart, who led the Illinois National Guard from 2007 to 2012, believes the federal courts, which have repeatedly blocked the deployments in Chicago and Portland from moving forward, also played a role. \"This shows the relative strength of the system and of the founding fathers in designing that system, where we had a separation of powers as well as a balancing of powers,\" he added. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration is challenging the rulings that block the use of troops and in the case over the deployment in Chicago, the administration has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. Some legal experts say it could have a ripple effect — to a degree — depending on how broadly the justices rule. \"The more broadly they construe their opinion, the more broad of an effect we're going to see,\" said Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center. Even as debates over the mobilizations play out in various courts, Trump has  suggested sending troops  to about half a dozen other cities, and warned of invoking the Insurrection Act to pave the way. Mirasola said there are limits to how much the courts can restrict the president's use of the military, and ultimately the public serves as a stronger check on power. \"It's always going to be public sentiment that I think is especially consequential,\" he said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5593087","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:05:00-04:00","title":"3 Massive Changes You'll See as the Climate Careens Toward Tipping Points","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As world leaders gather at COP30 in Brazil, scientists warn that Earth is on track to exceed the critical 1.5°C warming threshold within the next decade due to insufficient global emissions reductions.

 3 massive changes you'll see as the climate careens toward tipping points \n         By Rebecca Hersher, Lauren Sommer \n        \n           Wednesday, November 19, 2025 • 5:05 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         World leaders are heading into the final days of COP30, the United Nations climate meeting in Brazil. They are trying to agree on how to curb global warming and pay for the costs of an increasingly hotter planet. For the last  eight years , one of the main goals of the annual negotiations has been to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to temperatures in the late 1800s. That temperature goal was established after a landmark international scientific report laid out the catastrophic effects of exceeding that amount of warming. But that goal is no longer plausible, scientists say. Humanity has not cut planet-warming pollution quickly enough, and the planet will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, likely in the next decade, according to a  recent United Nations report . However, all is not lost. If countries can cut overall greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2035, scientists say the planet would quickly return to lower levels of warming. \"We must move much, much, faster on both reductions of emissions and strengthening resilience,\" U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell told world leaders at COP30. Right now, countries are pursuing policies that would cut emissions by just 12% by 2035. \"The science is clear: we can and must bring temperatures back down to 1.5 [degrees Celsius] after any temporary overshoot,\" Stiell said. If countries follow through on current promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the latest estimates suggest that Earth's temperature will  top out  around 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming this century. The latest science also makes clear the profound human costs of exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, even temporarily. The planet has warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius, according to the  World Meteorological Organization . And communities are already experiencing more dangerous storms, flooding and heat waves. When the  planet heats up beyond 1.5 degrees , the impacts don't get just slightly worse. Scientists warn that massive, self-reinforcing changes could be set off, having devastating impacts around the world. Such changes are sometimes called climate tipping points, although they're not as abrupt as that term would suggest. Most will unfold over the course of decades. Some could take centuries. Some may be partially reversible. But they all have enormous and lasting implications for the humans, plants and animals on Earth. And every tenth of a degree of warming makes these tipping points more likely, according to a  new report  from 160 international climate researchers. Here are the three most important and well-studied changes, from collapsing ice sheets to thawing Arctic permafrost, to disappearing coral reefs. Change #1: Coral reefs could be gone forever For coral reefs, the tipping point may have already begun. Widespread coral die-offs have been seen around the globe as ocean temperatures heat up, making it the first domino to fall, according to a  new report . By overall area, coral reefs are a tiny part of the ocean. But they're a bedrock ecosystem for marine life, supporting an estimated 25% of all species. Corals are highly sensitive to heat. When marine heat waves hit, corals come under stress, and they expel the algae that live inside them and that they need to survive. The reefs then turn a ghostly white color. A bleaching event doesn't necessarily mean the end for a coral reef. Corals have the ability to recover, given enough time. But repeated heat waves, as seen at  Australia's Great Barrier Reef  and  off the coast of Florida , can kill a reef, leading to the collapse of the ecosystem. Oceans are also becoming more acidic, as they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit from burning fossil fuels. That also stresses corals, making it difficult for them to build their skeletons. High ocean temperatures caused a  global coral bleaching event  in 2023-24, the second in the last ten years. If the world passes 2 degrees Celsius of heating, an estimated  99% of the world's coral reefs could be lost . The damage is happening faster than scientists expected. Combined with the effects of pollution and human development, half of all reefs worldwide will be in unlivable conditions by 2035, according to a  recent study  from the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. \"The coming decades will bring, I think, unprecedented change for both these reef systems and humanity in general,\" says Erik Franklin, professor at Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, who worked on the study. It's estimated that half a billion people around the world depend on coral reefs for food, income and livelihoods. Losing reefs would destabilize many countries, along with risking extinction for marine life that can only be found on coral reefs. \"There's entire societies and economies that are built around reef systems, especially in equatorial and tropical regions,\" Franklin says. \"So these societies will be in dire straits.\" Many scientists are searching for \"refuges\" – pockets of the ocean where conditions might remain livable for coral reefs. They're also selectively breeding corals, both in  Florida  and  Australia , boosting the corals' natural abilities to withstand heat. The hope is that might help corals hold on,  surviving just long enough  until humans can get their heat-trapping emissions under control. Change #2: Ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica could collapse Ice sheets are the massive frozen expanses that cover Greenland and Antarctica, and which  contain about two-thirds  of the freshwater on Earth. Climate change is already causing them to melt, and raising sea levels around the world. But if the Earth lingers at, or above, 2 degrees Celsius of warming, as it is on track to, that melting will steadily accelerate. Scientists warn that will cause parts of the ice sheets to collapse, sending massive amounts of water into the world's oceans. The million dollar question is how quickly that collapse will occur. \"Collapse tends to be a bit of a loaded word. People think of it like a building collapse,\" says Ian Joughin, a glaciologist at the University of Washington who has spent decades studying how giant glaciers move and change. \"Maybe a better timescale for an ice sheet [collapsing] is the Roman Empire,\" Joughin explains. Like a dying empire, the ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica are huge. It will take decades or even centuries for them to disintegrate. This year marks the  29th year  in a row that Greenland has lost more ice than it gained. In 2021,  rainfall was recorded  at the ice sheet's highest point, rather than snow, a sign that warmer temperatures were triggering widespread melting. As temperatures continue to warm, scientists say the two-mile thick ice sheet in Greenland is getting out of balance. Snow and ice are melting faster than they're being replaced, and as the ice melt accelerates, the process is difficult to stop. Research suggests that the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet may already be underway. A massive glacier there, which covers an area about the size of the state of Washington, is melting quickly in response to climate change, and could splinter into the ocean in the coming decades. If that glacier melts entirely, it will add so much water to the oceans that sea levels will rise about 2 feet. If the entire West Antarctic ice sheet melts, scientists estimate that sea levels will rise about 12 feet. Due to their enormous size, ice sheets have a huge amount of inertia. Once the melt process gets underway, it's difficult to stop. \"It takes a few hundred years to really get going,\" says Joughin. \"And it's kind of a snowball effect, where the faster it goes, the more it's going to go.\" But it will take a long time for people around the world to feel the most extreme effects of that melt. \"It could be anywhere from two or three hundred years to a thousand years,\" says Joughin. If humans slow down the pace of global warming, it will help slow down the pace of ice melting, giving the billions of people who live along coastlines more time to adapt. Change #3: Permanently frozen ground is thawing Climate change is causing permafrost – the permanently frozen ground in the Arctic – to thaw. And as the Earth approaches 2 degrees Celsius of warming, that thawing ground will cause both local and global problems. Let's start local. When permafrost thaws, the ice that's trapped in the ground turns into water and drains away. \"It can have really profound consequences,\" says Merritt Turetsky, a permafrost researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"We can see lakes draining overnight. We can see ecosystems becoming much drier in some areas, because the permafrost was actually holding the water up at the surface.\" That's because when the ground is frozen, it's impermeable to moisture, like the lining of a bathtub. \"When it thaws, we pull the drain out of the bathtub,\" Turetsky explains. Thawing permafrost has profound impacts for the millions of people who live in the Arctic. In many places, the land is sinking as it thaws, cracking the foundations of buildings, buckling roads and runways and kinking pipelines. That will accelerate as the Earth heats up more. Thawing permafrost also has global climate implications. Permanently frozen ground is like the world's freezer: millennia of dead plants and animals are locked up in permafrost. \"When permafrost thaws it's a little like losing power to your freezer. That food starts to rot,\" explains Ted Schuur, a permafrost expert at Northern Arizona University. Bacteria and fungi start to digest the carbon-rich soil, releasing planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Basically, it's an infinite loop of greenhouse gasses: human emissions cause the planet to heat up. That heat thaws permafrost, which releases more emissions. In recent years, advances in Arctic data collection have allowed scientists to measure greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost more accurately, says Schuur. The upshot has been sobering. \"This new science is showing that this is happening right now,\" he explains. The so-called tipping point has  already begun . But how much extra carbon ultimately gets released by Arctic permafrost in the future is up to humans. \"The faster we can decarbonize society today, the more permafrost carbon we can keep in the Arctic ground where it belongs,\" says Turetsky. For example, by using renewable energy sources instead of burning fossil fuels. \"Every tenth of a degree matters. And every act we take matters,\" says Schuur.

Formed almost four decades ago, the rock band's artistic ambition has always been connection — pop anthems that can be blasted from car speakers and in karaoke bars, and sung en masse. These songs stick around, but never wear out their welcome. This set is bookended by songs from  Dizzy Up the Girl , the 1998 album that found the sweet spot between catchy arena rockers and heartfelt power ballads. \"Slide\" is particularly suited to the space as John Rzeznik's voice, which has aged gracefully into the velvet rasp he's known for, rings clearly across the song's careening melody. \"Feel the Silence\" is a sturdy and perhaps little-known gem from 2006's  Let Love In . \"Not Goodbye (Close My Eyes),\" too, is a meditative ballad waiting to find more ears. But how could Goo Goo Dolls not close with \"Iris\"? Originally written for the  City of Angels  soundtrack, revived by  Deadpool & Wolverine  and consistently discovered by listeners seen by its romantic melodrama, \"Iris\" has returned from the brink of winking irony and been once again embraced for its desperate sincerity.

authorities search for 24 other girls abducted in Nigeria \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Wednesday, November 19, 2025 • 6:23 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         MAGA, Nigeria — A schoolgirl who was abducted with 24 others from a dormitory in northwestern Nigeria has escaped and is safe, the school's principal told The Associated Press on Tuesday, as hunters joined security forces in the search for the missing students in forests close to the school. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The girls were kidnapped before dawn on Monday, when gunmen attacked the dorm at the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Kebbi state's Maga town. Local police said the gunmen scaled the fence to enter the school premises and exchanged gunfire with police officers before seizing the girls and killing a staff member. No group has claimed responsibility for taking the girls, but analysts and locals say gangs of bandits often target schools, travelers and remote villagers in kidnappings for ransoms. Authorities say the bandits are mostly former herders who have taken up arms against farming communities after clashes between them over strained resources. Mass school kidnappings are especially common in northern Nigeria, and the Kebbi school is close to conflict hot spots including Zamfara and Sokoto states, where several gangs are known to operate and hide out. The student who escaped arrived home late Monday, hours after the kidnapping, according to the school principal Musa Rabi Magaji. Another student was able to escape the gunmen in the minutes after the raid and was not abducted, the principal told AP. \"They are safe and sound,\" Magaji said. A video verified by AP shows the two schoolgirls, who appear to be in their early teens, lost in thought and surrounded by family and other villagers, with hijabs covering their heads. High schoolers in Nigeria are usually aged between 12 and 17. Intensified rescue efforts Security forces and hunters, meanwhile, have intensified efforts to find and rescue the others, local officials said. Security teams swept nearby forests where gangs often hide while others were deployed along major roads leading to the school. Kebbi Gov. Nasir Idris visited the school on Monday and assured of efforts to rescue the girls, and Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Waidi Shaibu met with soldiers in the hours after the attack and directed \"intelligence-driven operations and relentless day-and-night pursuit of the abductors,\" according to an army statement. \"We must find these children. Act decisively and professionally on all intelligence. Success is not optional,\" the army chief said. Families recount predawn attack By Tuesday morning, the dorm and the classroom block — a walking distance apart — were deserted. In Maga, families waiting for news of their children's freedom expressed anger and frustration. Resident Abdulkarim Abdullahi, whose daughter and granddaughter — aged 13 and 10, respectively — were among the kidnapped children, said he overheard the noise from his house. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I was at home when I suddenly heard gunshots from the school. We were told that the attackers entered the school with many motorcycles,\" said Abdullahi. Amina Hassan, wife of the school vice principal Hassan Yakubu Makuku, said the assailants broke into their house, which is on the school premises, and fatally shot her husband. He was also the school's chief security officer. \"Three of them entered and asked my husband, 'Are you Malam Hassan?' and he responded, 'Yes, I am.' They told him that we are here to kill you,\" she told the AP. School abductions are a strategy to draw attention At least 1,500 students have been seized in the region since Boko Haram jihadi extremists seized 276 Chibok schoolgirls over a decade ago. But bandits are also active in the region, and analysts say gangs often target schools to gain attention. Analysts and residents blame the insecurity on a failure to prosecute known attackers, and the rampant corruption that limits weapons supplies to security forces while ensuring a steady supply to the gangs. \"Let's say people have been kidnapped in the markets — it doesn't go far, (or) if people have been kidnapped on the road — it doesn't go far,\" said Oluwole Ojewale, a security analyst at the Institute for Security Studies. \"What gains traction is when (it is) strategic kidnapping, like school children.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611496","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"How a small Chicago nonprofit is resisting Trump's war on DEI","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A small Chicago nonprofit, Chicago Women in Trades, is fighting to preserve its mission of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the construction industry amid President Donald Trump's sweeping executive orders that target and threaten to dismantle DEI programs.

It was the marquee event of the annual Tradeswomen Build Nations conference. The women marched, sang and rang cowbells, proudly sporting their union t-shirts and carrying banners announcing their trades: plumbing, pipefitting, roofing, drywall finishing and many more. Leading the parade in fluorescent vests and hardhats was a drumline made up of a dozen or so staff from the nonprofit Chicago Women in Trades. \"This is amazing to see what it has grown into,\" says Lauren Sugerman, who worked as an elevator constructor in the 1980s before spending the bulk of her career at Chicago Women in Trades. \"To see the sisterhood that has been built is so empowering.\" But behind the celebration are grave concerns that the organization, which has been breaking down barriers for women in the construction industry since Ronald Reagan was president, could be brought down by President Trump. As Trump wages a war against diversity, equity and inclusion or DEI, Chicago Women in Trades is fighting back in court, both for its own preservation and for the movement. Trump's all-out effort to end DEI Hours after Trump took office, he signed a pair of executive orders cracking down on what he said was widespread and illegal use of \"dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences.\" His orders called on  government agencies to cease DEI-related work  and  directed government contractors and grantees  to end their programs promoting it. Trump also  rescinded a 1965 executive order , signed by former President Lyndon B. Johnson, that required federal contractors and subcontractors to take proactive steps to ensure they weren't violating federal anti-discrimination laws.  Trump promised a renewed emphasis on merit, replacing what he called a \"pernicious identity-based spoils system.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Here's why that's a problem for Chicago Women in Trades: The organization was founded in 1981 in response to Johnson's executive order and a subsequent Labor Department requirement — also now gone — that federal contractors make good faith efforts to get women onto construction sites. Its stated mission is to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, including by recruiting women and helping them qualify and compete for high-wage union construction jobs.  Some 70% of its participants are Black and Latina. As of January, roughly 40% of its annual budget came from U.S. Labor Department grants. What is illegal DEI? Lots of threats but no clarity While the loss of federal grants would be devastating, perhaps even more damaging to Chicago Women in Trades is the certification provision tucked inside one of Trump's executive orders. Going forward, federal contractors and grantees must certify that they are not operating programs \"promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.\" Anyone found to have knowingly reported false information could face steep civil and criminal penalties, according to the executive order. \"There's a lot of threats out there but no clarity on what is illegal DEI,\" says Chicago Women in Trades Executive Director Jayne Vellinga. \"It is unclear how the industry or anyone is going to respond to it.\" It's a conundrum that puts the nonprofit in a precarious position. Chicago Women in Trades works closely with labor unions and contractors to ensure the women they recruit and train can get into apprenticeship programs to grow their careers. Would unions and contractors now sever those relationships if forced to certify that they're not engaging in illegal DEI? Without those established systems, Vellinga fears hard-won gains for women could be lost. \"We have an administration that is trying to turn back the clock on progress it has taken decades to achieve,\" says Vellinga. In a statement to NPR, White House spokesman Kush Desai pushed back. \"Instead of DEI boondoggles that accomplish nothing, the Trump administration is laying the groundwork for Americans of all backgrounds to help build our next Golden Age,\" Desai wrote, pointing to  another executive order Trump signed  that aims to boost the country's skilled trades workforce. Trump has pledged to support 1 million new registered apprenticeships per year and says a plan for doing so is forthcoming. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Women-focused programs have changed lives Talk to female construction workers around Chicago and you get a sense for how Chicago Women in Trades has long worked to achieve those same goals. Second-year plumbing apprentices Kaitlyn Truty, Charlie Willoughby and Juliet Silvestre credit the nonprofit with getting them into their careers. \"I 100% believe so,\" says Truty. All three women came through the organization's free, 10-week training program, where they got an introduction to the gamut of construction trades and learned basic skills such as tool handling and blueprint reading. \"We had to work out as well,\" says Willoughby, recalling the morning gym sessions. As part of an assessment to enter the plumbers union, they had to lift an 80-pound box onto a shelf over their heads. Chicago Women in Trades brought in plumbers to teach them how to do it. \"It was so intimidating,\" says Truty. \"I couldn't do more than two pushups walking in, and I walked out … being able to do 50-plus pushups in one go, and I lifted that box.\" The apprentices say having a community of women around them helped them believe that they were up to the task and prepared them for the challenges they would face as females in the industry. Even now, they say they are often the only woman on a job site. \"The people in your family don't understand what you're going through, but another tradeswoman can relate to you,\" says Silvestre. \"They understand me.\" The carpenters union ends \"Sisters in the Brotherhood\" Already, one building trades union has taken steps to avoid running afoul of Trump's executive orders. Earlier this year, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, representing more than a half million workers in North America, disbanded its Sisters in the Brotherhood program. For more than a quarter century, the program gave women carpenters a space to build networks and share ideas for how to overcome barriers. In a memo, Douglas McCarron, the union's general president, wrote that current policies targeting identity-based initiatives put the program at legal risk. It's been replaced with an engagement program, open to all members. \"It's very ironic that you can have a 'Brotherhood of Carpenters' which references brothers, but you can't have – because of DEI – a 'Sisters in the Brotherhood,'\" says Kina McAfee, a retired union carpenter who is now on staff at Chicago Women in Trades. \"I don't understand it. And it will impact our ability to get women into the trades in the future.\" The union did not respond to NPR's questions about the change. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Awaiting a major ruling Already, Chicago Women in Trades' lawsuit challenging Trump's anti-DEI executive orders has brought the nonprofit some protection. In April, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly in the Northern District of Illinois preemptively blocked the termination of one of the nonprofit's federal grants. Kennelly also blocked the certification provision in Trump's executive order for Labor Department contractors and grantees nationwide, after finding that Chicago Women in Trades was likely to prove it would suffer irreparable harm should the provision stand. The Trump administration has appealed that part of Kennelly's decision to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. In court briefs, the administration has argued that the provision merely requires grantees to verify that they won't violate existing federal anti-discrimination laws. The court is expected to hold a hearing on the matter, though a date has not been set. As Vellinga awaits a ruling, she says it's hard to imagine what the future will look like. \"We feel like we're in limbo,\" she says. Particularly vexing to Vellinga is that Chicago Women in Trades is fighting this battle at a time when women still make up less than 5% of the skilled trades workforce nationwide. \"You cannot look at the workforce of the construction trades and say, 'Oh, they've taken DEI too far,'\" she says with a rueful laugh. \"You look at the workforce of the construction trades and you see we have a long way to go.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   President Trump's war on diversity, equity and inclusion is reaching far beyond the federal government. Many employers have ended their DEI programs. Universities and community groups have lost funding for equity-related work. But one small nonprofit is fighting back. NPR's Andrea Hsu reports from Chicago. ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Under a warm sun this fall, a raucous gathering. (CHEERING) HSU: Thousands of female construction workers joined a mile-long parade, celebrating gains they've made in an industry still dominated by men. The women carried banners proudly announcing their trades - plumbing, carpentry, painting, roofing. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) The roof, the roof, make it waterproof. HSU: And leading the parade was a drum line, a dozen or so women in fluorescent-yellow vests and hard hats. They are the staff of Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit established in the 1980s. Its mission is to promote equity by getting more women into good-paying union construction jobs. Seventy percent of its participants are Black and Latina. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLES BLOWING) HSU: So behind the celebration, there are grave concerns. Chicago Women in Trades has worked to recruit, train and place women in construction jobs since Ronald Reagan was president. Now, President Trump could bring its demise. Back in January, Trump signed a pair of executive orders cracking down on what he sees as widespread and illegal use of, quote, \"dangerous, demeaning and immoral race- and sex-based preferences.\" He cut funding for DEI-related work and told government contractors and grantees to end programs promoting DEI. Chicago Women in Trades executive director is Jayne Vellinga. JAYNE VELLINGA: We have an administration that is trying to turn back the clock on progress it has taken decades to achieve. HSU: But her group is not letting that happen without a fight. Early this year, Chicago Women in Trades sued the government over Trump's executive orders, which threaten its very existence. The nonprofit relies heavily on federal grants, and more damaging may be the provision that requires contractors and grantees to certify that they're not promoting illegal DEI. They could face civil and criminal penalties if they report false information. Jayne Vellinga says that's caused great confusion. VELLINGA: There's a lot of threats out there but no clarity about what actually is illegal DEI, and it is unclear how the industry or anyone is going to respond to it. HSU: Already, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters disbanded its Sisters in the Brotherhood program. For decades, the program gave women carpenters a space to build networks and share ideas for how to overcome barriers. In a memo, the union's president wrote that current policies targeting identity-based initiatives put the program at legal risk. It's been replaced with a member engagement program open to all. Now talk to female construction workers around Chicago, and you get a sense of how women-focused programs have changed lives. Kat Truty and Charlie Willoughby are second-year plumbing apprentices. They say Chicago Women in Trades is the reason why they have promising careers. KAT TRUTY: I 100% believe... CHARLIE WILLOUGHBY: Yes. TRUTY: ...So yeah. WILLOUGHBY: Yes. Yes. HSU: They both came through the nonprofit's free 10-week program, where they got an introduction to the gamut of construction trades and acquired some basic skills such as measuring and blueprint reading. TRUTY: We learned about tool safety, tool handling. WILLOUGHBY: We had to work out, as well. TRUTY: Every day, we worked out. WILLOUGHBY: In the morning, we had to work. HSU: Chicago Women in Trades partners with unions and contractors to ensure graduates like them a future in the industry. But if Trump's executive order stands, all of this could fall apart. Now because of the ongoing legal battle, Chicago Women in Trades has been able to hold onto some of its federal funding. And a lower court said, for now, labor department contractors and grantees don't have to certify that they're DEI-free. That the Trump administration has appealed. Jayne Vellinga says it's hard to imagine what the future will look like. VELLINGA: We don't know what to think. I mean, we feel like we're in limbo. HSU: What she finds so ironic is that even after decades of agitating, women still make up less than 5% of the skilled trades workforce nationwide. VELLINGA: You cannot look at the workforce of the construction trades and say, oh, they've taken DEI too far. HSU: She says you look at the workforce, and you see women have a long way to go.

        SIDON, Lebanon — An Israeli airstrike on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon on Tuesday killed 13 people and wounded several others, state media and government officials said. It was the deadliest strike on Lebanon since a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war a year ago. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The drone strike hit a car in the parking lot of a mosque in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirts of the coastal city of Sidon, the state-run National News Agency said. The Lebanese Health Ministry said 13 people were killed and several others wounded in the airstrike, without giving further details. Hamas fighters in the area prevented journalists from reaching the scene, as ambulances rushed to evacuate the wounded and the dead. The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas training compound that was being used to prepare an attack against Israel and its army. It added that the Israeli army would continue to act against Hamas wherever the group operates. Hamas condemned the attack in a statement saying the strike hit a sports playground and denying that it was a training compound. Over the past two years, Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed scores of officials from the militant Hezbollah group as well as Palestinian factions such as Hamas. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Saleh Arouri, the deputy political head of Hamas and a founder of the group's military wing, was killed in a drone strike on a southern suburb of Beirut on Jan. 2, 2024. Several other Hamas officials have been killed in strikes since then. Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. That sparked Israel's offensive on the Gaza Strip that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. A day after the Israel-Hamas war started, Hezbollah began firing rockets toward Israeli posts along the border. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes in Lebanon, and the two sides became locked in an escalating conflict that became a full-blown war in late September 2024. That war, the most recent of several conflicts involving Hezbollah over the past four decades, killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $11 billion worth of destruction, according to the World Bank. In Israel, 127 people died, including 80 soldiers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The war ended in late November 2024 with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. Since then, Israel has carried out scores of airstrikes in Lebanon, saying that Hezbollah is trying to rebuild its capabilities.

A new name for an old tradition  Of course, people have been celebrating Thanksgiving with friends for centuries. The concept of Friendsgiving has long permeated pop culture, from 1973's  A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving  (in which an overburdened Snoopy cooks for the gang after they invite themselves over) to  Friends , which went on the air in 1994 and included  Thanksgiving plotlines  in each of its 10 seasons. But the proper noun only came along relatively recently. Merriam-Webster  started tracking \"Friendsgiving\" in 2007, after it appeared in posts on what was then Twitter and the early message board Usenet. The word's obvious meaning and accessible pronunciation helped it catch on quickly, Brewster says. \"Friendsgiving\" popped up in lifestyle blogs and news articles over the years before hitting it big in 2011. That year, it was both the focus of a Bailey's Irish Cream  ad campaign  and a major plot point in a  Real Housewives of New Jersey  episode ( titled \"Gobblefellas\" ). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Google  searches for \"Friendsgiving\"  spiked that November, and increased every year for the rest of the decade. \"All a word like this really needs is to just have more of a presence in the culture, and then it gets adopted into the language very quickly,\" Brewster says. Merriam-Webster added \"Friendsgiving\"  to its dictionary  in 2020, 13 years after its first known use. While Brewster wasn't involved in that decision, she says \"it was clear that it met our criteria.\" \"We had been seeing these examples of it for a few years, and … it looked like it wasn't going to go anywhere,\" Brewster adds. The made-up holiday has inspired  chain restaurant deals  and numerous hosting guides, and even counted a  sitting president  among its participants in 2023. There are no official statistics on how many Americans celebrate Friendsgiving, but  online surveys  from recent years suggest numbers could be  as high as 20% . Brewster wonders whether we are seeing more Friendsgiving gatherings at least in part because there is now a name for them. It doesn't hurt that it's a catchy \"blend word,\" which she says Americans especially get a kick out of (see: \" Barbenheimer \" or \" Galentine's Day \"). \"I'm curious … if the existence of the word has somehow generated more of this kind of socializing,\" she adds. \"I think words do have that power, that they can actually influence action.\" \"Friendsgiving\" isn't one-size-fits-all  Lizzie Post, the co-president of the Emily Post Institute, says the etiquette-focused organization started getting questions about Friendsgiving do's and don'ts around the time the word entered the lexicon. \"They were questions along the lines of: 'Is it OK to host Friendsgiving and go to your family Thanksgiving?' 'Can you only do Friendsgiving if your family isn't around and you can't travel to them?' \" she explains. The answer turned out to be a resounding yes. Many of those who celebrate Friendsgiving typically do so in addition to their family Thanksgiving, not instead of it. \"I think Friendsgiving is a nice way to be able to do both,\" says Emily Stephenson, a cookbook author whose work includes  The Friendsgiving Handbook , published in 2019. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Stephenson says she has been hosting Friendsgiving — even though she never called it by that name — for about two decades, starting when she attended college abroad. \"It kind of implies … a younger person who's maybe doing things that's not going to be super traditional,\" she says. \"And I do think part of what's implied in Friendsgiving is maybe it being the first time you host.\" To Stephenson, younger generations' embrace of Friendsgiving makes perfect sense, particularly after the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throwing a dinner party can be a rare and special experience, especially for 20-something apartment dwellers who are potentially many years away from hosting a family Thanksgiving. And there's not one right way to do it, considering the holiday is made-up and the real thing is just around the corner. Stephenson says that hopefully takes some pressure off. \"If you are hosting and a turkey stresses you out, you don't need to make turkey,\" she adds. Post says these days, most of the questions the institute gets about Friendsgiving revolve around the etiquette of potlucks. The most important thing, she says, is to make clear who is responsible for what. \"I think that as people, we really value spending time with one another, taking a break from the everyday,\" Post says. \"And whether that means eating off of paper plates … in front of a football game on the couch with a big buffet behind us, or whether that's a formally set table, matters not. It's the gathering that makes the big difference.\" Tips for your next Friendsgiving  That said, there are things both hosts and guests should keep in mind to help make Friendsgiving as easy as pie. Here's some of the best advice we got from Post and Stephenson: For hosts: Do  ask people if they have allergies or dietary restrictions beforehand.  Do  keep track of who is bringing what, whether you assign specific dishes or leave guests to fill out a shared spreadsheet. And if someone shows up with something that wasn't on the list, serve it anyway.  Do  take responsibility for the main dish — but it doesn't have to be a full turkey. Stephenson suggests preparing a less time-consuming turkey leg or breast, or skipping the bird altogether in favor of something like a shepherd's pie, savory galette or lasagna.  Do  make it easier for out-of-town guests by tasking them with store-bought contributions, like drinks, napkins or a premade crudité platter.   Do  give guests key details in advance, like what time the meal will actually be served (especially on a weekend) and a dress code if you're planning a more formal event.  Don't  be afraid to ask guests to help out. Post recalls that when her mom used to host some two dozen Thanksgiving guests, she would ask people to not only bring a dish but sign up for a job — from setting out place cards to lighting candles to checking who wants ice cream with their pie. \"Some people faint when I say this,\" Post laughs. \"But … little tasks like that, when spread out over the whole group, not only make it a little bit even more of a communal experience, but they help ease the burden on the host.\" Do  try to send guests home with leftovers of the dish they brought. \"Just because they've brought it to your house doesn't automatically make it yours,\" Post says. If they don't want it, transfer it into another container so you can clean their original dish and send it home with them.  For guests: Do  inform the host of any dietary restrictions (if they don't ask), but do so \"with an offer to bring something that meets your needs,\" Post says.   Don't  arrive empty-handed. \"I don't think there's many rules for being a guest besides … don't make soup,\" Stephenson says, since it adds another round of dishes to clean.  Do  the heavy lifting before you leave the house. Since kitchen space will be limited, it's best to bring a dish that is ready to eat, even if it needs a few minutes in the oven first.  Don't  show up expecting leftovers, though of course it's nice if you end up with some.  Do  remember to thank your host — verbally is fine, Post says. If your friends are into group activities, you may well get a chance to share what you're thankful for anyway. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5415939","dateOfPublication":"2025-05-31","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump pardons drug kingpins even as he escalates U.S. drug war rhetoric","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, despite publicly advocating for a harsher drug war—including threats of the death penalty for drug dealers—has pardoned or commuted the sentences of at least 13 individuals convicted of major federal drug crimes, including violent offenses.

Trump pardons drug kingpins even as he escalates U.S. drug war rhetoric \n         By Brian Mann \n        \n           Saturday, May 31, 2025 • 6:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump has long called for escalating the U.S. drug war against Mexican cartels and wants tougher penalties for dealers selling fentanyl and other street drugs in American communities.  \"I am ready for it, the death penalty, if you deal drugs,\"  Trump said  during a meeting with state governors in February, where he said dealers are too often treated with a \"slap on the wrist.\"    But despite his tough rhetoric, Trump has sparked controversy by pardoning a growing number of convicted drug dealers, including this week's move to grant clemency to Larry Hoover, 74, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison for   crimes linked to his role leading the Chicago-based Gangster Disciples .   Already during the early months of his second term, Trump has granted clemency to at least eight individuals convicted on federal drug charges. Some,  including Hoover, have extensive criminal records involving violence  and gun charges. \"There's a lot of mixed messages and mixed signals [from the White House] which creates sort of chaos and uncertainty,\" said Jeffrey Singer, a drug policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank.  \"On the one hand you're threatening even tougher penalties on people who deal in drugs, while on the other hand you're releasing drug dealers from prisons.\"  The case of Larry Hoover and the Gangster Disciples Ron Safer, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago who helped prosecute members of the Gangster Disciples during the 1990s, said he was shocked and dismayed by Trump's decision to commute Hoover's sentence.   He pointed out that Hoover's gang was one of the largest and most violent drug syndicates in the U.S.,  operating in 35 states according to the U.S Justice Department . Hoover himself was convicted of state and federal charges including murder and use of a firearm while trafficking drugs. \"Larry Hoover was the head of perhaps the most pernicious, efficient drug operation in the United States,\" Safer said. \"They sold over $100 million of drugs a year in the city of Chicago alone. They were responsible for countless murders. They supported their drug territories with ruthless violence.\" Hoover was first incarcerated in 1973 after being convicted of murder. In the 1990s, he was convicted of federal charges linked to his role directing the Gangster Disciples.  Hoover is now expected to be transferred from a federal supermax prison to a state correctional facility in Illinois, where he'll remain behind bars, for now, because of the state-level murder conviction. Hoover has sought clemency from Illinois officials before, though his latest bid for parole was  rejected overwhelmingly by a state review board in December 2022 .  But a White House spokesman, commenting on background because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly, told NPR the Trump administration expects Illinois officials to follow the federal government's lead by freeing Hoover.    \"There have been many advocates saying the time [Hoover] served in prison was adequate,\" the spokesman said.  Amid calls for tough punishments, clemency for high-level drug traffickers Trump's clemency for Hoover and other drug offenders follows a pattern that began during his first term in the White House. While promising tough action against drug dealers,  Trump  pardoned or commuted the sentences of at least 13 people convicted of federal drug crimes  between 2017 and 2021, including high-level dealers linked to violence or convicted of operating major trafficking rings.  In 2020,  Trump's administration also freed a senior Mexican military official  arrested by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Los Angeles on charges he helped cartels traffic drugs into the U.S. Under pressure from Mexico's government, officials in Trump's Justice Department dropped prosecution of General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda. In the first month of his second term, Trump also pardoned  Ross Ulbricht, a former tech entrepreneur serving a life term in federal prison  for creating Silk Road, a dark web internet site that became a major conduit for drug traffickers.    \"Ulbricht also demonstrated a willingness to use violence to protect his criminal enterprise and the anonymity of its users, soliciting six murders-for-hire in connection with operating the site, although there is no evidence that these murders were actually carried out,\"  federal prosecutors said in a statement  after Ulbricht was sentenced in 2015.   Commenting on background, the White House spokesman said there is no contradiction between Trump's tough-on-dealers rhetoric and his decisions to free some individuals involved in drug trafficking.  \"The punishment does not always fit the crime,\" the spokesman said. \"The president is open to seeing if these people are worthy of redemption.\" Some critics of the U.S. drug war offered cautious praise of Trump's use of presidential authority to free drug offenders. \"President Trump's potential decision to grant clemency to people with drug convictions offers a crucial lifeline to those affected and affirms what communities have long known: Criminalization of drugs is ineffective and harmful,\" said Kassandra Frederique, head of the Drug Policy Alliance, in a statement sent to NPR. But Frederique is critical of Trump's wider stance on drug policy. \"These individual acts of clemency starkly contrast with the administration's broader tough-on-crime rhetoric and its ongoing efforts to dismantle lifesaving health services,\" Frederique said.  Some view Trump's pardons as \"transactional\" During his final days in office,  President Joe Biden pardoned thousands of offenders , many of them incarcerated on federal drug charges. Biden said the move reflected his growing unease with the drug war. \"This action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities, and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars,\" Biden said. Drug policy experts interviewed by NPR said it's difficult to find a coherent philosophy behind Trump's use of clemency. According to the Cato Institute's Singer, Trump's pardons often appear \"transactional\" and often reflect the influence of powerful individuals.   \"He actually promised in front of the Libertarian Party convention that if he was elected he would pardon Ross Ulbricht. That was a promise he made hoping to get support from Libertarians,\" Singer said. \"It's not like there's an ideological thread running through [Trump's] decisions.\" During that campaign appearance in 2024, Trump openly linked his plan to commute Ulbricht's sentence to his bid for the White House. \"If you vote for me, on day one I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht to a sentence of time served,\"  Trump said, sparking applause from Ulbricht's supporters . The release of Larry Hoover, meanwhile, was championed by the artist Ye — formerly known as Kanye West — who thanked Trump this week on the social media platform X. \"WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR OUR DEVOTED ENDURING PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FREEING LARRY HOOVER,\"  Ye wrote .  During his first term, Trump pardoned and freed Alice Marie Johnson after the  reality TV star Kim Kardashian called for her release .  Johnson was convicted in 1996 and sentenced to life behind bars for her nonviolent role as part of a Memphis, Tenn., cocaine trafficking ring. Earlier this year,  Trump appointed her to serve as his \"pardon czar.\" In a social media post, Johnson, too, praised the president's latest round of pardons.   \"Today 26 deserving individuals were granted clemencies and pardons. Each one represents a story of redemption, rehabilitation, and resilience,\"  Johnson said on the platform X . \"Their second chance is a second shot at life.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   President Donald Trump is calling for a new escalation of the drug war against Mexican cartels, and he says he wants the death penalty for drug dealers in the U.S. But Trump is also sparking criticism for granting clemency to a growing number of people convicted of major federal drug crimes, including violent crimes. NPR's Brian Mann reports. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: When the White House announced this week President Trump had commuted the federal life prison sentence of Larry Hoover, founder of a drug organization called the Gangland (ph) Disciples, Ron Safer was shocked and outraged. RON SAFER: Larry Hoover was the head of perhaps the most pernicious, efficient and broad drug operation in the United States. MANN: In the 1990s, Safer was a U.S. attorney in Chicago who helped prosecute Hoover and other members of his gang. SAFER: They were responsible for countless murders, and they supported their drug territories with ruthless violence. MANN: Hoover is now expected to be transferred from a federal supermax prison to a state correctional facility in Illinois, where he'll remain behind bars for now because of a state-level murder conviction. Hoover has also sought clemency from Illinois officials, but his latest bid for parole was denied by a state review board in 2022. Trump's federal clemency for Hoover comes despite the president's increasingly tough rhetoric against drug dealers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Every country that has the death penalty has no drug problem. They execute drug dealers. MANN: Speaking in February of this year to a gathering of state governors, Trump blasted what he described as a weak response by the U.S. to drug smuggling and dealing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We have a much softer policy. We give them a slap on the wrist and say, kill a lot of people. MANN: This isn't the first time Trump's drug war rhetoric appears out of sync with his decisions to commute the sentences of high-level drug offenders. NPR found at least 13 cases during Trump's first term where he pardoned inmates serving lengthy sentences for drug offenses, some involving violent crimes and firearms. In 2020, under pressure from Mexico's government, Trump's administration also freed a senior Mexican official arrested by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for allegedly conspiring with the Mexican drug cartels. This year, in Trump's first months back in the White House, he's pardoned or commuted the sentences of eight more drug offenders, including Hoover and Ross Ulbricht. Ulbricht is a former tech entrepreneur, sentenced in 2015 to life in federal prison after he created a notorious dark web internet platform called Silk Road that was used by drug gangs before being shut down by U.S. authorities. Speaking on the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to free Ulbricht in exchange for political support. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: And if you vote for me, on Day 1, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht... (CHEERING) TRUMP: ...To a sentence of time served. MANN: Ulbricht was released from prison in January. NPR asked White House officials for a comment on how Trump's leniency towards some drug offenders accords with his call for harsher penalties for dealers and cartel members. They haven't responded. Jeffrey Singer is a drug policy analyst with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank critical of the drug war. He says Trump's approach to drug crime appears transactional, with pardons extended to drug criminals with influence. JEFFREY SINGER: There's a lot of mixed messages and mixed signals, which creates sort of chaos and uncertainty. On the one hand, you're threatening even tougher penalties on people who deal in drugs, while on the other hand, you're releasing drug dealers from prison. MANN: Earlier this year, Trump appointed a new pardon czar named Alice Marie Johnson to help him identify more federal inmates deserving clemency. Johnson herself is a former drug offender who was serving a federal life sentence. She was freed by Trump during his first term, after the reality TV star Kim Kardashian called for Johnson's release.

2025-11-19T01:07:30+00:00\n\nTOKYO (AP) — Firefighters and army helicopters battled a fire Wednesday that burned through a neighborhood of old wooden houses in a fishing town in southwestern Japan, killing one person, injuring another and forcing more than 170 people to evacuate. A man in his 70s was unaccounted for and firefighters later found a body, possibly of the missing man, and a woman in her 50s suffered a minor injury, the Oita prefecture disaster response team said. Dozens of fire engines and more than 200 firefighters were mobilized to battle the fire, which was not still fully under control more than a day after it started. The Ground Self-Defense Force dispatched two UH-1 army helicopters to assist. It may take a few more days before the fire is completely extinguished, town mayor Shinya Adachi told reporters after he visited the devastated neighborhood Wednesday. At least 170 homes have been damaged or burned down, the disaster response team said. The residential section struck by the fire is close to the coastal area of Oita known for mackerel fishing but not near the prefecture’s popular hot spring resorts, called onsen, and historic, thatched-roof homes.

The blaze spread to a forest, affecting about 4.9 hectares (12 acres), the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said. There was an advisory for strong wind when the fire broke out. A firefighter told the Kyodo News Agency that fire fighting operation was hampered by narrow backstreets where fire engines could not enter. There were also abandoned homes in the rapidly aging and shrinking neighborhood, Kyodo said. The local network YTV noted that the narrow alleyways where the fire burned had old wooden houses. The fires spread quickly as a strong wind was “blowing in all directions,” a 59-year-old office worker told Kyodo as she recalled how the fire started Tuesday evening. Authorities are still investigating the fire’s cause and how it spread, the FDMA said. Japanese television footage showed smoke rising from swaths of land filled with destroyed and damaged houses, though orange flames were no longer visible by midday Wednesday. The Oita prefecture said about 260 homes remained without electricity Wednesday afternoon. A resident told Kyodo that she quickly fled without many of her belongings because the fire “spread in the blink of an eye.” Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi posted a statement on X offering sympathy for those affected by the fire and pledged to “provide maximum support.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-saudi-crown-prince-mbs-505b32527e58d4bd49d5bc917efb4936","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:02:16+00:00","title":"Trump Welcomes Saudi Crown Prince in Major Diplomatic Visit Amid Khashoggi Controversy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a pivotal visit to Washington on November 18, 2025, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman became the first to visit the White House in seven years, marking a significant revival of U.S.-Saudi relations.

The U.S.-Saudi relationship had, for a time, been sent into a tailspin by the operation targeting Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the kingdom. But seven years later, the dark clouds over the relationship have been cleared away. And Trump is tightening his embrace of the 40-year-old crown prince, who he said is an indispensable player in shaping the Middle East in the decades to come. Trump in his defense of the crown prince derided Khashoggi as “extremely controversial” and said “a lot of people didn’t like that gentleman.” Prince Mohammed denies involvement in the killing of Khashoggi, who was a Saudi citizen and Virginia resident. “Whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen,” Trump said when asked about the killing by a reporter during an Oval Office appearance with Prince Mohammed. “But (Prince Mohammed) knew nothing about it. And we can leave it at that. You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.” But U.S. intelligence officials determined that the Saudi crown prince likely approved the killing by Saudi agents of U.S.-based journalist inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul , according to U.S. findings declassified in 2021 at the start of the Biden administration. Trump officials, during his first administration, refused to release the report. Prince Mohammed said Saudi Arabia “did all the right steps” to investigate Khashoggi’s death. “It’s painful and it’s a huge mistake,” he said. Trump, who said the two leaders have become “good friends,” even commended the Saudi leader for strides made by the kingdom on human rights without providing any specific detail. New investment from Saudis The crown prince for his part announced Saudi Arabia was increasing its planned investments in the U.S. to $1 trillion, up from $600 billion that the Saudis announced they would pour into the United States when Trump visited the kingdom in May.

It’s also about long-term opportunity,” Prince Mohammed said. Trump’s family has a strong personal interest in the kingdom. In September, London real estate developer Dar Global announced that it plans to launch Trump Plaza in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. It’s Dar Global’s second collaboration with the Trump Organization, the collection of companies controlled by the U.S. president’s children, in Saudi Arabia. Trump pushed back on suggestions that there could be a conflict of interest in his family’s dealings with the Saudis. “I have nothing to do with the family business,” Trump said. PHOTOS See the best photos of Trump welcoming the Saudi crown prince at the White House Trump’s comments about Khashoggi’s killing and defense of his family’s business in Saudi Arabia were blasted by human rights and government oversight activists. Human rights groups say Saudi authorities continue to harshly repress dissent, including by arresting human rights defenders, journalists and political dissidents for criticism against the kingdom. They also note a surge in executions in Saudi Arabia that they connect to an effort to suppress internal dissent. “President Trump has Jamal Khashoggi’s blood on his hands,” said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director for DAWN, a U.S.-based group advocating for democracy and human rights in the Arab world that was founded by Khashoggi. Rolling out the red carpet Trump warmly received Prince Mohammed when he arrived at the White House Tuesday morning for a pomp-filled arrival ceremony that included a military flyover and a thundering greeting from the U.S. Marine band. Technically, it wasn’t a state visit, because the crown prince is not the head of state. But Prince Mohammed has taken charge of the day-to-day governing for his father, King Salman, 89, who has endured health problems in recent years. Later, Trump and first lady Melania Trump welcomed the crown prince for a black-tie dinner in the White House East Room. The boldface names who attended included Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. Trump at the dinner announced he was designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally. The designation, while largely symbolic, provides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense, trade and security cooperation.

Ahead of the visit, the Saudis had signaled they were looking for formal assurances from Trump defining the scope of the U.S. military protection for the kingdom. “A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries,” Trump said. “And it will serve the highest interest of peace.” Fighter jets and business deals On the eve of Prince Mohammed’s arrival, Trump announced he had agreed to sell the Saudis F-35 fighter jets despite some concerns within the administration that the sale could lead to China gaining access to the U.S. technology behind the advanced weapon system. The White House announced the two leaders formalized the F-35 agreement Tuesday as well as a deal for the Saudis to purchase nearly 300 tanks from the U.S. They also signed agreements signifying closer cooperation on capital markets and critical minerals markets, as well as efforts against money laundering and terrorist financing. Trump’s announcement on the fighter jets was surprising because some in the Republican administration have been wary about upsetting Israel’s qualitative military edge over its neighbors, especially at a time when Trump is depending on Israeli support for the success of his Gaza peace plan . Abraham Accord talks The visit comes at a moment when Trump is trying to nudge the Saudis toward normalizing relations with Israel. The president in his first term had helped forge commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates through an effort dubbed the Abraham Accords .

Getting Saudi Arabia — the largest Arab economy and the birthplace of Islam — to sign on would spur a domino effect, he argues.

The Israelis remain steadfastly opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state. “We want to be part of the Abraham Accords, but we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path of a two-state solution,” Prince Mohammed said. ___ AP writers Josh Boak, Fatima Hussein, Seung Min Kim, Michelle L.

But “Wicked” has always been a spectacle of scale: power ballads and sprawling sets, all in retina-testing technicolor. Muchness is part of the point of “Wicked,” a song-and-dance assault of allegory and anthems relayed with an earnestness that you might call endearing if you’re good or tiresome if you’re, well, you know.

Josh O’Connor gets a hosting turn, too What to Stream: ‘Wicked: For Good’ soundtrack, Ted Danson, ‘The Bad Guys 2' and Black cowboys Cynthia Erivo wows crowd with her sunglasses at the ‘Wicked: For Good’ NY premiere For anyone in the former camp who somehow felt last year’s part one wasn’t enough, “For Good” will probably be a very welcoming second helping. Since these films were shot at the same time, much of the tone and tenor of the first chapter continues in “For Good.” There’s more Cynthia Erivo, more Ariana Grande and more soaring soliloquies. For most “Wicked” fans, more is good. But for those of us who felt — what’s a non-wicked way to say this? — mildly waterboarded, in pink and green, by “Wicked,” “For Good” doesn’t offer much relief. There is, to be sure, great talent on display in these films, particularly in the case of Erivo. But “For Good,” like its predecessor, often feels more like a Production than a movie, with characters shuffled on and offstage with Oz-like orchestration. That may be an unavoidable aspect of a pop amalgamation like “Wicked.” This is a big-screen adaptation of a 2003 stage musical (Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwartz) based on a 1995 book (Gregory Maguire) inspired by a 1939 movie (Victor Fleming and company) and the original 1900 “The Wizard of Oz” by L. Frank Baum. More than a century of American entertainment is packed inside “Wicked.” So, yes, “The Wizard of Oz” is basically history at this point. And that was much of the wit of Maguire’s book, which took Baum’s Oz and imagined that all of its apparent dichotomies — the vilified Wicked Witch of the West, the perfect Glinda the Good Witch, the powerful Wizard — were mere propaganda. If history is a set of falsehoods agreed upon, then Oz, too, is a lie.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Those political metaphors move to the forefront in “For Good.” Having spent much of part one filling in the backstory of Elphaba (Erivo) and Glinda (Grande) as classmates at Shiz University, the second chapter finds Oz in an increasingly agitated state. Elphaba, demonized as the Wicked Witch of the West, is now living in exile. “Shield your children,” trumpets the government messaging. “Trust no animals!” While the Yellow Brick Road is laid down, like railroad tracks on the frontier in an industrial haze, the hunt for Elphaba ratchets up. A travel ban is put in effect for animals and Munchkins, alike. Oz, it’s said, is “a place that seems to be devolving.” No one above the age of 10 will fail to miss the target of these references. “Wicked: For Good” isn’t shy about them, and that frankness — and the movie’s ardent belief in empathy and multiculturalism — is both the film’s most stirring and most heavy-handed trait. Each iteration of “Wicked” has come with its own political relevancy. Maguire, himself, was influenced by the drumbeat leading up the Gulf War. “For Good” may be the most pointed and timely interpretation yet. Some of that is woven into the play, and some of it is expanded upon in Holzman’s and Dana Fox’s script, which pads the second act with a little more minor character development and a pair of new songs. The catchiest tunes (“Popular,” Defying Gravity”) are in the rearview, though. Instead, “Wicked: For Good” is all storm clouds and rebellion, as Elphaba mounts a resistance to the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh). Characters like Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey), captain of the Wizard’s guard, are forced to pick a side.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Considering the source material of the 1939 classic — old Hollywood at the very height of its powers — you would think Oz would come through clearly as a setting, only seen from a different perspective. But despite Chu’s energetic handling of earlier films like “In the Heights” and “Crazy Rich Asians,” “Wicked: For Good” struggles to really orient us in a place. When Dorothy and Toto drop in (they’re seen only from afar), you almost yearn for the clear pathway they begin skipping down. Instead, “Wicked: For Good,” rather than conjuring Oz anew, always feels like it’s jumping from one set piece to another. Maybe this is a silly gripe for a fantasyland. (“I don’t have any idea where the offices of the Lollipop Guild are!”) But I rarely found myself lifted into a movie world, but rather sat watching it — sometimes with admiration, rarely with delight — from the mezzanine. The rub of going for maximum effect all the time is that the actors never have a chance to simply be. All the momentum that “Wicked: For Good” does gather is owed significantly to its stars. To a large degree, these movies have been the Erivo-and-Grande show, a grand spectacle of female friendship that rises above all the petty biases and misjudgments to forge a vision of harmony in opposites. It’s a compelling vision, and Chu, as he did in the triumphant “Defying Gravity” culmination of part one, knows how to stick the landing. Grande is best at the (too few) comic moments, like a brief impression of Margaret Hamilton’s cackle. But it’s Erivo who really elevates the material. Her Elphaba seems to both believe in the hopeful possibility of “Wicked” and fear its impossibility. When she melancholily sings one of the new songs, “No Place Like Home,” Erivo appears to grasp that it’s going to take more than a click of the heels, or tick of the clock, to get there. “Wicked: For Good,” a Universal Pictures release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action/violence, some suggestive material and thematic material. Running time: 137 minutes. Two stars out of four."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-trump-11-18-2025-b4cc39532d7f100299ff3aa23c2143f1","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:37:27+00:00","title":"Palestinian Attack in West Bank, U.N.

The attack follows a spate of settler violence against Palestinians across the West Bank. Officials, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio , have warned that such unrest could spill over and undermine the fragile truce in Gaza. It came a day after the U.N. Security Council gave its backing to U.S. President Donald Trump’s blueprint to secure and govern Gaza . Hamas rejected the plan as other countries signaled excitement and readiness to help implement it. Violence flares in the West Bank The Israeli military said the stabbing took place at the Gush Etzion junction south of Jerusalem, a site of many past attacks by Palestinian militants. Israel’s emergency rescue services said a 71-year-old man died of stab wounds at the scene. Three other people were hospitalized, including a woman in serious condition and a teenager in moderate condition. The military said Israeli troops then opened fire, killing two Palestinian attackers. The Palestinian Health Ministry later identified them as two 18-year-olds from the Hebron area.

Hamas did not claim responsibility for the attack, but in a statement called it “a normal response to the occupation’s attempts to liquidate the Palestinian cause,” vowing that Israeli aggression wouldn’t go unchallenged. Elsewhere in the West Bank on Tuesday, news network Al Jazeera’s local bureau chief, Walid al-Omari, said Israeli forces shot cameraman Fadi Yassin in both legs while he was covering a protest in the city of Tulkarem. The military did not respond to a request for comment. Tulkarem has been a flashpoint throughout the year, with Israeli forces frequently carrying out incursions around the Nur Shams refugee camp, which they say is home to many militants. Civilians say the area has endured repeated raids, sieges and home demolitions, prompting regular protests by Palestinians angry about operations pushing people from their homes An Associated Press journalist saw soldiers fire into the air to disperse protesters and then shoot toward Yassin as he moved toward the camp entrance to film. The journalist later saw Yassin on the ground, injured and surrounded by Palestinians, including women and children, before he was carried by bystanders to an ambulance. The violence came a day after Israeli settlers rampaged through the Palestinian village of al-Jab’a, torching homes and cars, drawing a rare condemnation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli leaders. World reacts to UN vote The United States, Israel and the Palestinian Authority praised the U.N. vote on Trump’s postwar Gaza plan. Hamas rejected it, saying the proposed security force would only help Israel maintain its grip on the territory. The resolution provides a wide mandate for an international force to provide security in war-devastated Gaza, approves a transitional authority called the Board of Peace to be overseen by Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state. Netanyahu, who otherwise applauded the resolution, did not mention the pathway to statehood in remarks about the plans. The plan calls for the stabilization force to ensure “the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.” It authorizes the force “to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate” in compliance with international law, which is U.N. language for the use of military force. Hamas said Monday that the force’s mandate, including disarmament, “strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.” It said the resolution did not “meet the level of our Palestinian people’s political and humanitarian demands and rights.” Hamas demanded that any international force be under U.N. supervision, deploy only at Gaza’s borders to monitor the ceasefire and operate exclusively with Palestinian institutions. The vote shores up hopes that Gaza’s fragile ceasefire will be maintained following a war set off by Hamas’ surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel’s offensive since then has killed over 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children. European Union to discuss Gaza reconstruction aid The European Union announced Tuesday it will host a conference on Thursday for a new Palestinian donors group to discuss financial aid for Gaza’s reconstruction, reforms of the Palestinian Authority and long-term peace in the Middle East. The EU has pledged in the past to help train police officers in Gaza and flood the war-torn coastal enclave with humanitarian aid. European Commission spokesperson Guillaume Mercier said delegations from 60 entities, including the EU’s 27 member states, some unnamed financial institutions, international organizations and other countries, would meet in Brussels. The meeting is to be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia. Another Commission spokesperson, Anouar El Anouni, said the U.N. Security Council resolution “provides the basis for moving into the next phase, including work related to the International Stabilization Force and the Board of Peace.” U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said Tuesday that the international community needed to “work together to take forward the 20-point plan and to turn it into a just and lasting peace.” Cooper called for “urgent action to open all the crossings, lift restrictions and flood Gaza with aid.” More on the US proposal Trump said the members of the Board of Peace will be named in the coming weeks, along with “many more exciting announcements.” The plan calls for the stabilization troops to secure Gaza border areas, along with a Palestinian police force that they have trained and vetted. The force will coordinate with other countries to secure the flow of humanitarian assistance , and should closely consult and cooperate with neighboring Egypt and Israel. As the international force establishes control, the resolution says Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza “based on standards, milestones, and time frames linked to demilitarization.” These must be agreed to by the stabilization force, Israeli forces, the U.S. and the guarantors of the ceasefire, it says. ___ Associated Press writers Edith M.

president of Harvard University who once served as U.S. treasury secretary, says he will step back from public commitments after the release of emails showing he maintained a friendly relationship with Jeffrey Epstein long after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008. Summers did not detail exactly what stepping back would entail, saying in a statement that he would continue to teach and promised to “rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.” “I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said. However, the Center for American Progress, a progressive DC-based think tank, confirmed Tuesday that Summers was “ending his fellowship at CAP.” A spokesperson for the Budget Lab at Yale also said Summers is no longer a member of the organization’s advisory group.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has since said she has ordered a top federal prosecutor to lead the investigation. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges he sexually abused and trafficked underage girls. Emails made public last week showed many in Epstein’s vast network of wealthy and influential friends continued to stay in touch long after his 2008 guilty plea. A 2019 email to Epstein showed Summers discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing that “I said what are you up to. She said ‘I’m busy’. I said awfully coy u are.” Epstein, who often wrote with spelling and grammatical errors, replied, “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.” <!-- The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: -->\nYour browser does not support the <code>iframe</code> HTML tag.

When asked about the emails last week, Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life” and that his association with Epstein was a “major error in judgement.” Thomas King, a Harvard student, described Summers relationship with Epstein as “shocking” but also “indicative of the kind of political environment that we now live in in 21st century U.S.” “It’s really surprising to hear that someone of such high esteem can continued to be associated with that man,” King said. “But I suppose we’re gonna have a lot of stories like this over the course of the next few months.” Summers served as treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under President Clinton. He was Harvard’s president for five years from 2001 to 2006. He is currently a professor and is a director of the school’s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, from Massachusetts, told CNN she believes Harvard should sever ties with Summers, saying he “cannot be trusted” with students. “For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,” Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor, told CNN. ___ Kruesi reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

Meanwhile, dozens of nations — rich and poor — banded together in a concerted call to deliver a detailed road map for the world to phase out or transition away from fossil fuels . Former Ireland President Mary Robinson , a fierce climate advocate, was unusually optimistic Tuesday, comparing the talks in Belem, on the edge of the Amazon, to the climate talks that produced the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement that set a target for limiting Earth’s warming. “This COP reminds me of Paris very much,” Robinson told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday. “I’m hoping for as good an outcome out of this difficult environment as possible. We can get it, you know, we can get it.” Wednesday is the big day Much of it will come to a head on Wednesday, the deadline set by COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago for a decision on four issues that were initially excluded from the official agenda: whether countries should be told to toughen their new climate plans; details on handing out $300 billion in pledged climate aid; dealing with trade barriers over climate and improving reporting on transparency and climate progress.

The issue that’s getting talked about by more than 80 nations is weaning the world from fossil fuels. Two years ago, after much debate, the U.N. climate talks in Dubai agreed on language for a “transition away from fossil fuels.” But the following year the issue disappeared from view. Now, many — but not all — countries are pushing for a detailed road map that would essentially give directions on how to phase out fossil fuels. “People around the world are mobilizing on a massive scale, demanding concrete action for climate justice, particularly against the expansion of fossil fuel,” said Colombia’s Environment Minister Irene Vélez Torres. “Our categorical decision backed by science and by people has been to phase out fossil fuels. Despite being a producer country of oil and coal, we have chosen not to grant any new oil exploration contracts, nor any new coal mining titles.” “We have to leave here with a call for a road map,” she said Tuesday. “There’s no other way.” Ed Miliband, secretary of state for energy and climate Change of the United Kingdom, speaks during a plenary session at the COP30 U.N.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Ed Miliband, the United Kingdom’s top official for energy and climate change, said the issue has united the Global South and North, “saying with one voice that this is an issue that cannot be ignored, cannot be swept under the carpet, and this is where the momentum is.” The COP presidency’s draft language on the phaseout road map caused strong positive and negative reactions, with perhaps more negative reactions than strong, said COP30 CEO Ana Toni. She said not only were fossil fuel nations against it, but other countries didn’t want something that would be seen as added requirements. U.S. President Donald Trump, who didn’t send anyone to the conference, has called climate change a scam. But do Lago raised one interesting possibility. Usually agreements coming out of COPs have to be by consensus and near unanimous. But he said since the idea of a fossil fuel transition was already approved by consensus in 2023, the road map may not need such a high bar for adoption. A draft to work from Do Lago kicked off Tuesday’s action with a proposal that had 21 options for negotiators on four sticky and interrelated issues. While the options in the draft text “are a first step, what’s required now is to eliminate the options that add to delay and ignore the urgency of action,” said Jasper Inventor, deputy program director of Greenpeace International. Tuesday was also a day for speeches from high-level ministers. Sophie Hermans, the Netherlands’ deputy prime minister, said “the transition is no longer about setting targets. It is about executing them. And execution requires realism, planning and the ability to adjust when circumstances change.” Pressure grows to reach an agreement The documents ask leaders to hash out many aspects of a potential agreement by Wednesday so that much is out of the way before the final set of decisions Friday, when the conference is scheduled to end. Climate summits routinely go past their last day as nations have to balance domestic concerns with the major shifts needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Lula was scheduled to return to Belem on Wednesday and the deadline may be timed for him to push parties together or celebrate some kind of draft agreement, observers said.

That timeline is “pretty ambitious,” said Alden Meyer, a senior associate at climate think tank E3G.

Security Council has backed the United States’ ambitious plan for the future of the Gaza Strip. How and when it will be carried out remain largely unknown. In a twist unimaginable across the tumultuous history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the plan would mean U.S. President Donald Trump becomes the de facto ruler of Gaza. The territory remains devastated by Israel’s campaign to eliminate Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war . An international body known as the Board of Peace, chaired by Trump, is to govern Gaza and oversee reconstruction under a 2-year, renewable U.N. mandate. An armed International Stabilization Force is to keep security and ensure the disarming of Hamas, a key demand of Israel. Major questions hang over nearly every part of the plan and the timeframe for implementation. In the meantime, nearly all Palestinians remain displaced and dependent on humanitarian aid, Hamas retains significant control over nearly half of Gaza and the rebuilding of the territory has barely begun.

But serious negotiations have not begun because Israel and Hamas remain in the first phase of the ceasefire deal that came into effect in October. The militant group is still required to hand over the bodies of the last three hostages. The U.N. resolution passed Monday gave the plan international legitimacy. That opens the door for Arab and Muslim-majority nations to participate, particularly by contributing troops to the ISF. The U.S. is hoping that the more those countries are involved, the more palatable the international rule will be for Gaza’s more than 2 million people. But the Palestinian public’s acceptance is far from certain. Without it, the Board of Peace risks becoming seen as a foreign occupation working on behalf of Israel, further thwarting their dream of self-determination and statehood. The plan gives Palestinians almost no voice in governing Gaza. Because of Israel’s fierce opposition, it doesn’t promise statehood, offering only a vague reference that it might one day be possible. It also gives only an ambiguous timetable for reconstruction to begin and for the Israeli military to withdraw from the around 50% of the Gaza Strip that it still holds since the ceasefire began.

Disarming Hamas and demilitarizing Gaza are the keystones to the whole plan. But there’s no detail on how that will happen. So far, the militant group has not agreed to disarm. In a statement after the U.N. resolution’s passage, Hamas said the fate of its weapons is connected to ensuring a path to the end of the Israeli occupation and the creation of a Palestinian state. The International Stabilization Force is tasked with ensuring disarmament and the destruction of Hamas’ military infrastructure. The ISF will also oversee a Palestinian police force, made up of vetted members trained by Egypt and Jordan. A number of nations have been cited as possible contributors to the ISF, including Egypt, Indonesia, Turkey and Azerbaijan. But none has committed to sending troops yet, and Israel opposes Turkey participating in the force. They are unlikely to want their soldiers to take Hamas’ weapons by force. Hamas warned that trying to do so would turn the ISF “into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.” Palestinian children look at the camera as they play in a makeshift camp for displaced people in Zawayda, in the central Gaza Strip, Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Hamas is under heavy pressure, particularly from Qatar and Egypt, to find a compromise. One possible idea is a “decommissioning” – handing the arsenal over to the ISF for safekeeping -- which Hamas could argue is not a permanent surrender of its right to armed resistance. Without disarmament, much of the rest of the plan could stall. Israel’s troop withdrawal is linked to the pace of Hamas demilitarization and the deployment of the ISF. Reconstruction is also unlikely to happen in most of Gaza unless Hamas disarms. Many Palestinians fear the end result will be a partition of Gaza between an Israeli-controlled zone, where some reconstruction might take place, and the rest, where almost all of the population of more than 2 million live with little rebuilding. Who will make up the Board of Peace? Trump has said the board will be made up of “distinguished leaders” from other countries, including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and that its members will be named in the coming weeks. But who they will be is unknown, and even Blair’s participation has not been confirmed. The U.N. resolution gives the Board complete say in Gaza with powers over the ISF, reconstruction and economic recovery. The Board is also to oversee a “technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians” who will run the day-to-day civil service in Gaza. Who are these independent Palestinians? The members of the Palestinian committee are to have no connection to either Hamas or the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers scattered parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel has rejected any role for the PA in Gaza. The plan doesn’t specify who will select the members, but that likely will fall to the Board of Peace. Israel will want to have a strong say in who can be included. In an online post, Palestinian political analyst and pollster Khalil Shikaki said the committee should be picked through an “an all Palestinian” process to boost its support, consulting among political factions, trade syndicates, local leaders and women’s and youth organizations. But if the Board and the committee are seen as a tool for the U.S. or Israel, prominent Palestinians may be reluctant to join. In its statement Monday, Hamas denounced the “international guardianship” that the U.N. resolution places on Gaza, saying it aims to further Israel’s interests.

The plan emphasizes two goals for Gaza – demilitarization and reconstruction. Anything beyond that remains largely blank. The U.N. resolution offers the possibility of the Palestinian Authority eventually taking control of Gaza if it carries out a slate of internal reforms to the satisfaction of the Board of Peace – everything from fighting corruption, increasing efficiency to holding elections. The Palestinian Authority welcomed the U.N. resolution in a statement Monday and said it was prepared to step in to govern Gaza. But Israeli opposition raises doubts whether that will ever be allowed to happen. Under pressure from Arab allies, the United States inserted a reference to Palestinian statehood in the U.N. resolution. But it remains only a vague nod. It states that if the Palestinian Authority “faithfully” carries out reforms and if Gaza redevelopment advances, “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” A man carries a child while riding his bicycle along a damaged street in the Al-Shati camp in Gaza City, Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The lack of a clear path to self-determination threatens to complicate every other step. For example, Shikaki wrote, without a path to statehood, “disarmament will be seen as capitulation; with it, demobilization can be framed as part of national strategy.” For much of the population, the priority is to see reconstruction and a revival of Gaza’s economy so families have livelihoods. If that comes, it could paper over reluctance toward international rule, at least for a time. If it doesn’t or if Palestinians see no progress toward self-determination, resentment is likely to mount. The potential for chaos is high with the multiple divisions within Gaza. Already, the territory has Hamas, several Israeli-backed armed gangs that oppose the militant group and the Israeli military itself. Add to those a Palestinian police force, international troops, Palestinians who join the administration and those who oppose it – and the scene becomes even more volatile."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-nick-fuentes-tucker-carlson-antisemitism-fd5c708aced52b0edfc24ab94809913f","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:06:41+00:00","title":"Trump Faces Backlash Over Tolerance of Far-Right Figures Amid Antisemitism Concerns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has faced criticism for his continued tolerance of far-right figures like white nationalist Nick Fuentes and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, despite their controversial statements on antisemitism.

But he had nothing bad to say about two people roiling his party : white nationalist Nick Fuentes and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson. The former Fox News host recently hosted Fuentes for a friendly interview, where he declined to challenge his guest’s bigoted beliefs or a remark about problems with “organized Jewry in America.” Asked about the controversy that has been rippling through Republican circles for weeks, Trump did not criticize Fuentes and praised Carlson for having “said good things about me over the years.” The president’s answer echoes his longstanding reluctance to disavow — and sometimes, his willingness to embrace — right-wing figures who have inched their way from the political fringe to the Republican mainstream. “We are disappointed in President Trump,” said Morton Klein, president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America, adding that he should “rethink and retract” his comments. The threat of antisemitism , which has percolated across the political spectrum, will likely be a recurring political issue in the coming year, as Democrats and Republicans battle for control of Congress in the midterms. Although Trump has targeted left-wing campus activism as a hive of anti-Jewish sentiment, Fuentes’ influence is a test of whether conservatives are willing to accommodate bigots as part of their political coalition.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More A top conservative group faces antisemitism controversy The turmoil has already engulfed the Heritage Foundation , a leading think tank whose president Kevin Roberts initially refused to distance himself from Carlson. A member of Heritage’s board of trustees, Robert George, announced his resignation Monday, which followed a recent decision by an antisemitism task force to sever its ties with the organization. Although Roberts has apologized, George said “we reached an impasse” because he didn’t fully retract his original support for Carlson. “I pray that Heritage’s research and advocacy will be guided by the conviction that each and every member of the human family, irrespective of race, ethnicity, religion, or anything else, as a creature fashioned in the very image of God, is ‘created equal’ and ‘endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights,’” George wrote on Facebook, quoting the Declaration of Independence. Laurie Cardoza-Moore, an evangelical conservative activist and film producer, joined Heritage’s antisemitism task force in June but stepped away when Roberts refused to resign. “If we aren’t solid on condemning antisemitism, shame on us,” she said Monday. Cardoza-Moore praised Trump’s record on supporting Israel but said he fell short on Sunday while talking about Carlson and Fuentes. “We can all agree — and I wish — that he would have gone further,” she said. It’s unclear what kind of pressure Trump will face despite his previous dalliance with Fuentes, who had dinner with the past-and-future president at his Mar-a-Lago club in between his two terms. “I don’t think President Trump during his first or second term could be acting more strongly to prevent antisemitism,” said Matthew Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. He noted Trump’s first-term relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and, more recently, the president’s handling of the war in Gaza.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Trump’s comments could prolong a Republican rift This is not the first time Trump has shied away from criticizing fringe elements on the right. During his first campaign for president, Trump initially declined to disavow support from white nationalist David Duke, saying, “I just don’t know anything about him.” He claimed there were “very fine people on both sides” during racist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia . While running for reelection, he told the extremist Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by.” Trump’s unwillingness to condemn either Fuentes or Carlson has the potential to prolong a rift within the Republican Party. On Sunday, as he prepared to fly back to Washington from a weekend in Florida, Trump praised Carlson and said “you can’t tell him who to interview.” “If he wants to interview Nick Fuentes — I don’t know much about him — but if he wants to do it, get the word out,” Trump said. “People have to decide.” Fuentes liked what he heard, posting “Thank you Mr. President!” on social media. Republicans debate their path forward Trump’s remarks run counter to a wave of objections that have flowed from key Republicans. The issue was the focus of a gathering of pro-Israel conservative leaders Tuesday in Washington called “Exposing and Countering Extremism and Antisemitism on the Political Right.” U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee spoke to attendees via video message. “There is so much antisemitism around the world today, but what perhaps is most troubling to me is that it is not just rising up on the far left, which we expect,” he said. The event also featured Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, and Klein, of the Zionist Organization of America. It was organized by the National Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, which recently severed ties with the Heritage Foundation over Roberts’ remarks. Heritage had been a founding partner of the coalition, which began in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. Perkins said the event had been discussed for some time. “But with recent comments by folks like Tucker, there was an urgency to go ahead and hold the conference,” he said. Klein expressed disappointment with how Trump discussed Carlson, though he still described Trump as his favorite president. Klein warned about antisemitism on the right getting a pass from institutions and media figures, saying, “We have to fight as hard as we can to not allow this to spread.” The recent annual summit of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas was similarly focused on condemning antisemitism within the party, a shift from the original plans to celebrate the ceasefire in Gaza and the return of Hamas-held hostages. Brooks said at the time, “We are at this point in what I consider sort of the early stages of an undeclared civil war within the Republican Party, as it relates to Israel, and antisemitism and the Jewish community.” “And it’s really going to be our challenge going forward to combat that before it has a chance to grow and metastasize in the Republican Party,” Brooks said. During one part of the conference, college students waved red signs that read, “Tucker is not MAGA.” Trump addressed the summit by prerecorded video, using his time to promote his administration’s support for Israel. He did not mention the controversy that had dominated the conference. ___ Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

(AP) — Facing a public backlash, the commission that oversees Alabama Public Television voted Tuesday to continue paying its contract with PBS, rejecting an effort — at least for now — to be the first state to cut ties with the broadcast giant because of politics and federal budget cuts. The Alabama Educational Television Commission voted without dissent to honor the contract with PBS that runs until July. The commission also voted to create a committee to explore the direction of Alabama Public Television. A motion to give the required 180-day nonrenewal notice, the first step to cutting ties with PBS, failed for lack of a second. The decision means PBS programming, which includes programs such as “Sesame Street,” “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” “Antiques Roadshow” and “PBS NewsHour” will remain on the state channel at least for the immediate future. Two commission members last month had floated the idea of severing ties with PBS , citing federal budget cuts to public broadcasting and accusations by President Donald Trump and other conservatives of bias in news programs. The possibility of dropping PBS prompted a backlash from Alabama public television viewers and donors. Related Stories Alabama Gov.

Follow on Diana Isom, a 28-year-old substitute teacher, said PBS programs have made a difference for her autistic son, who initially had difficulty speaking and walking but now is at kindergarten level while still in preschool. The children at the autism clinic her son attends watch PBS programs each day, she said. “Kids benefit so much, especially autistic kids, from PBS. ... We need PBS,” Isom said. One audience member held a sign reading, “Elmo is not the enemy of the people,” an apparent reference to comments by a commissioner last month that, “PBS has made themselves the enemy of what I stand with.” The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides about $2.8 million for Alabama Public Television, although the money goes to a foundation and is not directly used to purchase PBS programming. The money is going away because of federal budget cuts. Alabama Public Television pays about $2.2 million to purchase PBS programming. Alabama Public Television Executive Director Wayne Reid said it would cost an estimated $3.5 million annually to replace the programs and digital support they currently receive from PBS at the cost of $2.2 million. He said dropping PBS would also likely cause the number of memberships, which provides substantial support, to plummet. “I think it’s clear from a very strong presentation by the executive director that not continuing with PBS would essentially be the death spiral of APT as we know it,” audience member Michael Sznajderman told the commission. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Monday had urged the commission to pause the decision until it has studied Alabamians’ opinions on the matter. Commission member Les Barnett proposed giving PBS the 180-day renewal notice required by the contract. He said that would give the state options if they decided to go in another direction after the study is completed. The motion failed without a second. Barnett had been one of the commissioners who had suggested separating from PBS. The action Tuesday continues the immediate relationship with PBS, although the commission could come back at a later time and act to sever ties. “Today was kind of an indication they aren’t interested in going that direction,” Ferris Stephens, the chairman of the commission, said after the meeting. Pete Conroy, a commission member who has been in favor of keeping PBS programming, said he believes the strong turnout and personal stories help sway the commission. But he cautioned that the issue could resurface. “It will require vigilance. It’s not settled. I think there was a course correction,” Conroy said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1911-11-19","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a diverse range of global events spanning sports, technology, politics, and security.

The soccer star was seated near the front of the East Room, not far from where the president and crown prince gave remarks to officials from both nations, along with major business leaders such as Apple CEO Tim Cook and Tesla founder Elon Musk. Trump, in his speech, made a point of recognizing Ronaldo, whom he said he introduced to his teenage son. Ronaldo has been the face of the Saudi soccer league since joining Saudi club Al-Nassr at the end of 2022 on a reported $200 million-a-year contract. The 40-year-old Portuguese star signed a two-year extension in June with Al-Nassr, which is majority owned by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund that the crown prince chairs. Trump thanked the athlete for attending. He said that his youngest son, Barron, is a “big fan” of Ronaldo and the 19-year-old was impressed that he got to meet the soccer player. “Barron got to meet him. And I think he respects his father a little bit more, now, just the fact that I introduced you,” Trump said.

U.S. intelligence agencies determined that Prince Mohammed likely directed the operation . He has denied involvement in the killing. It was a rare U.S. visit for Ronaldo, who hasn’t played in the country since 2014. In 2017, German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that Ronaldo had years earlier paid $375,000 in hush money to a woman who accused him of raping her at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. Ronaldo’s lawyers maintained the sex was consensual and no criminal charges ever were filed. World Cup connection Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup after FIFA and its president, Gianni Infantino, shaped a fast-track bidding process two years ago that helped ensure there was no rival bid. Ronaldo promoted that bid, saying last December when the Saudi win was confirmed “after what I see, I’m more convinced that 2034 will be the best World Cup ever.” Ronaldo is set to play at a record sixth edition of the World Cup next year after Portugal qualified Sunday for the tournament co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. However, he likely will be banned by FIFA for Portugal’s first game next June after getting his first red card last week in 23 seasons playing for the national team. Portugal will learn its World Cup opponents on Dec. 5 at the tournament draw , which Trump is set to attend at the Kennedy Center in Washington. Trump has closely aligned himself with the 2026 World Cup . In the Oval Office he has a copy of the golden trophy loaned to him by FIFA President Gianni Infantino. ___ Dunbar contributed from Geneva.

the Earth and a Brazilian flag emblazoned with the words “Protected Amazon”.\n\nIt was the first major protest outside the conference, which began earlier this week in Belem, bringing together world leaders, activists and experts in a push to tackle the worsening climate crisis.\n\nIndigenous activists previously  stormed the summit , disrupting the proceedings as they demanded that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva take concrete action to ensure their territories are protected from growing threats.\n\nAmnesty International warned in a recent report that  billions of people  around the world are threatened by the expansion of fossil fuel projects, such as oil-and-gas pipelines and coal mines.\n\nIndigenous communities , in particular, sit on the front lines of much of this development, the rights group said.\n\nBranded the “Great People’s March” by organisers, Saturday’s rally in Belem came at the halfway point of contentious COP30 negotiations.\n\n“Today we are witnessing a massacre as our forest is being destroyed,” Benedito Huni Kuin, a 50-year-old member of the Huni Kuin Indigenous group from western Brazil, told the AFP news agency.\n\n“We want to make

climate march she has participated in. “This is incredible,” she told The Associated Press. “You can’t ignore all these people.”\n\nThe COP30 talks come as  the UN warned  earlier this month that the world was on track to exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) mark of global warming – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “very likely” within the next decade.\n\nIf countries do as they have promised in their climate action plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5C (4.1 to 4.5F) by 2100, a report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found.\n\n“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop,” said UNEP chief Inger Andersen.\n\nDespite that urgency, a nalysts and some COP30 participants have said they don’t expect any major new agreements to emerge from the talks, which conclude on November 21.\n\nStill, some are hoping for progress on some past promises, including  funding to help  poorer countries adapt to climate

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good.

“elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/whats-behind-a-surge-in-bear-attacks-in-japan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:32:02+00:00","title":"What’s behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan is experiencing a sharp rise in bear attacks since April 2025, with 13 deaths and over 100 injuries reported — the highest since 2006.

surge in bear attacks in Japan?\n\nA deadly conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:46:39+00:00","title":"As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is facing a worsening water crisis due to six consecutive years of drought, with precipitation levels 81% below historical averages.

2025-11-12T13:46:39+00:00\n\nTitle: As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/19/are-the-superrich-really-fleeing-the-uk-due-to-taxes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:05:51+00:00","title":"Ahead of the budget, are the superrich really fleeing the UK due to taxes?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the ongoing speculation that wealthy individuals are fleeing the UK due to anticipated tax changes, particularly following Labour’s first budget and the introduction of policies affecting capital gains and entrepreneur relief.

David Lesperance, a Canadian wealth adviser based in Poland, is working against the clock for one of his British clients.\n\nJohn*, who requested anonymity, is trying to relocate to Dublin, the Irish capital, ahead of November 26, when Chancellor Rachel Reeves will deliver the budget – a statement presenting the Labour government’s plans for public finances for the year ahead.\n\nHaving built a company worth around 70 million pounds ($92m) that he plans to sell soon, John wants to avoid a hefty capital gains tax bill.\n\nAs his children are in university, upping sticks is possible. He hopes to take advantage of the Republic of Ireland’s non-domiciled, or “non-dom”, tax regime, which would exempt him from Irish taxes as well.\n\n“We’ve been moving fast to organise his immediate departure to Ireland,” said Lesperance, who has been assisting him in shifting his assets abroad. “With higher taxes looming, the costs of leaving early are a rounding error.”\n\nJohn is not alone.\n\nThe footballer Rio Ferdinand has recently moved to Dubai, citing tax as a push factor, while Egyptian billionaire and Aston Villa co-owner Nassef Sawiris, who moved his residency to Italy and the United Arab Emirates from Britain, told the Financial Times earlier this year that everyone in his “circle” is considering moving.\n\nHerman Narula, the 37-year-old British Indian founder of Improbable, a tech company, announced this month that he is fleeing to Dubai. Worth about 700 million pounds ($920m), he is said to be Britain’s richest young entrepreneur. Among his reasons for fleeing were reported plans by the Labour government to impose an exit tax on wealthy people leaving the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile that proposal appears to have been ditched, the overall business environment for entrepreneurs is increasingly unpredictable, Narula and a few others say.\n\n“There is alarming evidence that some entrepreneurs are leaving the UK,” reads a recent open letter to Reeves, signed by more than a dozen wealthy business owners, including Nick Wheeler, founder and chair of the men’s clothing retailer Charles Tyrwhitt, and Annoushka Ducas, a jewellery designer.\n\n“As the government prepares for this year’s Budget, it must carefully consider the cumulative impact of these policies on entrepreneurs,” the letter warns.\n\nWhen the budget is delivered, all eyes will be on any changes to taxation – an issue affecting everyone in the UK. In recent months, speculation about tax amendments on property, incomes and pensions has repeatedly made headline news.\n\nRumours about the superrich abandoning the UK have been swirling for an even longer period, triggered by the mere prospect of a Labour government last year. Since the Keir Starmer-led government was elected last July, a range of media outlets have homed in on case studies suggesting that Labour is driving wealth out.\n\nThe first Labour budget last October outraged some high-earning individuals in the UK, who said they were already taxed too much.\n\n“Last year’s Budget measures, including changes to Capital Gains Tax, Entrepreneur’s Relief, and Employer National Insurance, have increased costs for many entrepreneurs and enterprises,” read the recent open letter from wealthy business owners to Reeves.\n\nThose changes came after the Conservatives abolished the non-dom regime, a status that allows for people with a residency abroad to avoid taxes in the UK.\n\nBut experts have offered words of caution on the supposed flight of the rich.\n\nThere is no official data on the number of wealthy individuals leaving because of Labour’s tax changes.\n\n“The most recent tax data on wealthy individuals with non-dom status from HMRC [His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the UK’s tax revenue department] shows that the number of non-doms leaving the UK is in line with or below official forecasts,” said Mark Bou Mansour, an advocate at the Tax Justice Network.\n\nClaims that recent revenue-boosting tax reforms have triggered a massive non-dom exodus are false and part of a wider rhetoric that is detrimental to the UK’s fiscal and economic health, he said.\n\n“Talking about whether the superrich will move if we tax can be a distraction from talking about the harms to economies and democracies that arise from not taxing extreme wealth,” he said.\n\nMansour pointed to a 2024 study by the London School of Economics that interviewed a number of wealthy individuals. It found the most important factors underpinning their reluctance to migrate were their attachment to the capital’s cultural infrastructure, private health services and schools, and the ability to maintain social ties.\n\n“There’s plenty of strong evidence showing that the superrich don’t choose to relocate just to pay less tax,” said Mansour.\n\nBehind a large number of articles predicting an exodus of wealthy people was a report by the passport advice firm Henley & Partners.\n\nHowever, the report was found to be based on flawed methodology, and was later amended.\n\nEven so, Lesperance said he has worked with a number of clients who have left the UK since Labour came into power.\n\nHe argued that while not necessarily large in number, the group makes up a high percentage of overall tax revenue raised by the government.\n\n“The tax contribution of a non-dom is about 220,000 pounds ($289,000) a year, which is about six or seven times the UK average,” he said, “They’re super contributors” who need to be protected, or else, “You’re going to actually see a drop in annual tax collections because these people have left.”\n\nSome of his clients have chosen to relocate to Milan and Dubai.\n\n“As one of my clients said, ‘London’s nice, but it’s not that nice,'” he said.\n\nBut Michelle White, head of private office at UK wealth management firm Rathbones, said that while her clients are internationally mobile and could move away, the majority have stayed put so far.\n\n“Since some of these articles started coming out saying the floodgates are open, we haven’t seen that,” she said.\n\nBritain’s schools, legal system and business environment continue to be pull factors, she argued.\n\nThose who have left usually have ventures or properties abroad and can easily relocate, or are considering selling their business in the next two years or so, and do not want to pay capital gains tax on sales.\n\nOthers have big payouts from private equity or hedge funds and want to avoid paying income tax.\n\n“It means that they’ll go and spend more time somewhere else and less time here in order to not pay UK tax on that sale,” said White.\n\nA large extent of her clientele in the end decides to stay in the UK to raise families, and mitigates taxation through smart planning.\n\n“I tell people to look at the next 50 years and plan taxes around that,” she said, “People take a long view.\n\n“Tax is one thing, but quality of life and how you actually want to live as a family often overrides the tax aspect.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/19/children-among-the-36-wounded-in-russias-overnight-attacks-on-ukraine","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:15:14+00:00","title":"At least 19 killed in Russian attacks across Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major escalation, Russia launched over 470 drones and 48 missiles—including one ballistic and the rest cruise missiles—across Ukraine overnight on November 19, 2025, killing at least 19 people and injuring dozens, with severe damage in Ternopil and Lviv.

Beijing in 2023 after the release of treated radioactive water from Japan’s crippled  Fukushima nuclear plant  into the sea.\n\nKyodo News, referencing sources with knowledge of the matter, said China has told Japan that the reimposition of the ban was due to the need for further monitoring of the  water from Fukushima  released into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nBut the ban comes amid a deepening crisis in relations between Beijing and Tokyo over remarks by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. The premier told parliament on November 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan, which threatened Japan’s survival, was one of the few cases that could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n\nTakaichi’s comments were met with a wave of criticism by Chinese officials and state media, prompting Japan to warn its citizens in China to take safety precautions and avoid crowded places.\n\nIn a post on X following Takaichi’s comments, the Chinese consul general in Osaka, Xue Jian, threatened to “cut off that dirty neck”, apparently referring to the Japanese prime minister. Tokyo said it had summoned the Chinese ambassador over the now-deleted social media post.\n\nBeijing has also advised Chinese citizens to avoid travelling to Japan and demanded that Takaichi retract her remarks, though Tokyo said they were in line with the government’s position.\n\nSeeking to defuse the row, Masaaki Kanai, Japan’s top official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Asia Pacific region, held talks on Tuesday in Beijing with his Chinese counterpart, Liu Jinsong.\n\n“During the consultations, China once again lodged a strong protest with Japan” over “Takaichi’s erroneous remarks”, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mao Ning said.\n\n“Takaichi’s fallacies seriously violate international law and the basic norms governing international relations”, Mao said, adding the Japanese premier’s comments “fundamentally damage the political foundation of China-Japan relations”.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Katrina Yu, reporting from Beijing, said the visit by Kanai to Beijing was seen as an effort by Tokyo to de-escalate tensions and communicate to China that Japan’s stance on independently-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory, has not changed despite Takaichi’s remarks.\n\n“It seems there were no concrete outcomes, but what we have seen, though, is some footage following the meeting of these two diplomats parting ways, and I think it really speaks for itself. We have very cold body language from both of these diplomats,” Yu said.\n\n“Liu Jinsong had his hands in his pockets, refusing to shake hands with the Japanese senior diplomat,” Yu said, adding that the Chinese official said afterwards that he was “very dissatisfied” with the meeting.\n\nLiu Jinsong, director-general of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, met with Masaaki Kanai, director-general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, on Tuesday.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Masaaki Kanai has left the Chinese…  pic.twitter.com/rdAy2YJruQ\n\n— China News 中国新闻网 (@Echinanews)  November 18, 2025\n\nBefore the most recent seafood ban, China accounted for more than one-fifth of Japan’s seafood exports, according to official data.\n\nThe dispute has also engulfed other areas of China-Japan relations, with China Film News, which is supervised by the state-backed China Film Administration, announcing that the release of two imported Japanese movies would be postponed amid the dispute.\n\nThe two movies were originally expected to be released on December 6 and November 22, respectively, according to review site Douban."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/19/philippines-ministers-resign-as-flood-scandal-reaches-presidential-palace","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"06:35:28+00:00","title":"Philippines ministers resign as flood scandal reaches presidential palace","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two top Philippine officials, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin and Department of Budget and Management Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, have resigned amid allegations of involvement in a major corruption scandal involving ghost infrastructure projects and the misappropriation of billions of dollars in public funds.

Higgins has a history of making extremist claims—such as alleging 'ghost buses' at the Capitol on January 6, denying the pandemic, and making offensive remarks about Haitian immigrants—raising concerns about his political credibility. Despite previously supporting the investigation, he now claims to have been a principled 'NO' from the start, and the bill includes redactions to protect identities, aligning with his concerns. The case underscores the tension between transparency and privacy in criminal justice, and highlights how individual lawmakers, especially those with controversial histories, can shape national

Republicans alike anticipated a clean,  unanimous vote  on Tuesday to force the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s case files. But one member did not join the consensus: Republican Representative Clay Higgins of Louisiana.\n\nHis lone dissent highlighted his history of staking out positions on the extreme edge of the Republican Party.\n\nThe United States House approved the measure by an overwhelming margin of 427, including 216 Republicans. The bill then moved to the Senate, which unanimously approved it, clearing the way for it to be sent for President Donald Trump’s signature.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nHiggins has represented Louisiana’s 3rd Congressional District since 2017. He is known as one of the most far-right members of the House and often takes positions that fall outside the Republican mainstream. He is also a strong Trump supporter.\n\nHiggins has drawn national attention for years, often because of controversy. Before he entered Congress, he worked in law enforcement, where he faced several misconduct complaints. He later became well-known online for his dramatic, tough-talking Crime Stoppers videos, which went viral and helped launch his political career.\n\nHis outspoken style has continued in Washington. In 2020, he posted a message on Facebook threatening the use of force against armed protesters, alongside a photo of Black demonstrators carrying long guns. “If we recognise threat … you won’t walk away,” he wrote. Facebook later removed the post.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Higgins was openly sceptical about the virus and claimed that the Chinese Communist Party had created and weaponised it.\n\nIn 2021, Higgins claimed that “ghost buses” – unmarked vehicles he said carried undercover agents or provocateurs – were sent to the US Capitol on January 6 to spark the violence. January 6 was the day a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol to stop certification of the 2020 election. No evidence has ever supported the Higgins claim.\n\nHiggins again drew backlash in 2024 after he made offensive comments about Haitian immigrants, echoing remarks Trump had made about the  Haitian community  in Springfield, Ohio, including the president’s unsubstantiated claim that Haitian immigrants were eating pets.\n\nHiggins called Haiti “the nastiest country in the Western Hemisphere”. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus confronted him, after which he deleted a post on Haitians eating pets and said he was referring to gang members, not all Haitians.\n\nEven before entering  Congress, Higgins was familiar with public criticism. He resigned from the St Landry Parish Sheriff’s Office in 2016 after facing backlash over one of his hardline anticrime videos.\n\nHiggins is the seventh of eight children. He was born in New Orleans, and his family moved to Covington, Louisiana, when he was six.\n\nIn 2017,  he said  he was working 16- to 18-hour days and that he sometimes slept on an air mattress in his Washington, DC, office.\n\nHiggins has been married four times. He currently lives in Port Barre, Louisiana, with his fourth wife, Becca.\n\nHiggins had previously  voiced  his support for the investigation by the committee and was a lead investigator.\n\nBut in a  post on X , Higgins explained his reasons for opposing the measure, saying the files could inadvertently entangle innocent people if they are released, and claimed that he had been opposed to making the documents public from the start.\n\n“I have been a principled ‘NO’ on this bill from the beginning. What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today. It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America. As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,” Higgins wrote. “If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt. Not by my vote.”\n\nHis worries were similar to those voiced by House Speaker Mike Johnson and other lawmakers. Supporters of the bill pushed back, saying those fears were unfounded and that safeguards were already included to prevent any sensitive details from being released.\n\n“The Oversight Committee is conducting a thorough investigation that has already released well over 60,000 pages of documents from the Epstein case. That effort will continue in a manner that provides all due protections for innocent Americans. If the Senate amends the bill to properly address [the] privacy of victims and other Americans, who are named but not criminally implicated, then I will vote for that bill when it comes back to the House,” he added.\n\nIn reality, however, the bill to release the files includes redactions of portions that would otherwise reveal the identities of witnesses, victims, their families and whistleblowers.\n\nAfter the vote, Higgins appeared to raise his phone and take a photo of the House voting board listing his dissenting vote just before votes closed.\n\nI have been a principled “NO” on this bill from the beginning. What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today. It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America. As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses,…\n\n— Rep.

fugitive.\n\nUntil August 2024, she was the most powerful leader in Bangladesh’s history, after 15 years of iron-fisted rule. On Monday, the 78-year-old former prime minister was handed a death sentence in absentia over the brutal crackdown by her security forces on last year’s student-led protests. More than 1,400 people were killed, many of them execution-style.\n\nHasina, who had fled to neighbouring India after she was forced out of power, has over the past year remained combative and unrepentant. On Monday, she responded to the verdict by the Bangladeshi International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) by acknowledging the deaths of hundreds of innocent people, but refused to take responsibility.\n\n“I mourn all of the deaths that occurred in July and August of last year, on both sides of the political divide,” she said in a statement. “But neither I nor other political leaders ordered the killing of protesters.”\n\nHasina also called the verdict by the ICT “biased and politically motivated”.\n\nFor millions of Bangladeshis, the death sentence awarded to Hasina represents justice, even though India’s likely refusal to extradite the former prime minister means that grieving families that lost loved ones to excesses under her rule will have to wait for closure.\n\nBut for Bangladesh as a country, the verdict could serve as a moment for an even deeper shift if it chooses to now close the loop on the abuse of security forces, courts and other institutions of the state to target opponents and critics – practices that Hasina perpetuated and came to represent.\n\nHasina’s claims that she is the victim of political persecution mirror the allegations that her government faced during the decade-and-a-half of its rule.\n\nThe ICT was established by Hasina herself in 2010 to prosecute Bangladeshis accused of collaborating with Pakistan in carrying out atrocities during the 1971 liberation war.\n\nNow the same tribunal has convicted her.\n\nFor years, human rights groups have accused her of using the tribunal together with government institutions, including courts and the security establishment, to punish her political opponents.\n\nHer main political rival – Khaleda Zia, who was Bangladesh’s first female head of government – was jailed under corruption charges while the country’s largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, was barred from contesting elections and subsequently banned under an “anti-terror” law.\n\nZia was released only after the interim government of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus came to power last year, following Hasina’s ouster.\n\nYunus himself was convicted in January 2024 on charges of labour law violations that many say were politically motivated. He was sentenced to six years in prison, but got bail. The economist had been in Hasina’s crosshairs after he floated the idea of launching a political party in 2007. Grameen Bank, established by Yunus, pioneered the concept of microloans, which helped empower millions of rural women.\n\nHasina and her Awami League party have long worn the badge of secularism. But during her rule between 2009 and 2024, they were accused of weaponising secularism to justify targeting Islamist parties and dissenters. An entire generation of Jamaat leaders was executed based on convictions issued by the ICT.\n\nWriting in the Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star on Monday, analyst Arman Ahmed said that the Awami League “transformed secularism from an ideal of freedom into a rhetoric of control”.\n\n“It came to be associated with censorship, patronage, and the systematic weakening of any political opposition. When power became synonymous with a single party, the moral authority of its secular project collapsed,” he wrote.\n\nHasina’s autocratic rule was particularly marked by grave human rights violations. Between 2009 and 2022, at least 2,597 people were killed by the security forces extrajudicially, according to human rights groups.\n\nIn 2021, the United States imposed sanctions against the police counterterrorism unit, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), accused of involvement in hundreds of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.\n\nOdhikar, a prominent rights group, was also targeted after it criticised the government for granting impunity to security forces for human rights violations. In 2023, two of its founders were jailed.\n\nFamed Bangladeshi photographer and activist Shahidul Alam was  jailed  in 2018 after he criticised Hasina’s government for widespread “extrajudicial killings”, in an interview with Al Jazeera.\n\nWhen the protests against government job quotas erupted last July, Hasina deployed riot police instead of engaging in talks with the stakeholders.\n\nShe  ordered  the security forces to use drones, helicopters and lethal weapons to suppress the protests, according to Bangladeshi media.\n\nBut the brutal crackdown, including the arrest of thousands, galvanised a mass movement against her government, triggering her downfall.\n\nNow, Hasina’s political future in Bangladesh is over.\n\nWhat remains is her legacy.\n\nTo be sure, she led a decade-long struggle to revive democracy in the 1980s, teaming up with rival Zia to force the country’s then-military ruler, President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, to relinquish power. Zia’s BNP won the 1991 election. Hasina then defeated Zia in the 1996 elections to become prime minister for the first time, as their political rivalry turned increasingly bitter.\n\nAfter Hasina returned to power in 2009, she addressed the country’s security challenges, cracking down on armed groups and providing stability.\n\nShe also led an economic resurgence. In a country that former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once described as a “basket case”, millions were lifted out of poverty under Hasina. Bangladesh’s per capita income surpassed neighbouring India, while its gross domestic product (GDP) of $430bn is bigger than Pakistan’s – the country it broke away from 54 years ago. Today, Bangladesh is the world’s second-largest garment exporter, after China.\n\nBut critics point out that growth under Hasina was not equitable, with the country’s wealthy class benefitting from her economic policies. She was also accused of favouring an Indian businessman over the interests of Bangladesh.\n\nAnd the economic strides that Bangladesh took were accompanied by human rights violations, arbitrary arrests, muzzling of the press, silencing of the opposition and the hollowing out of the country’s democratic institutions.\n\nThe BNP, the main opposition party, boycotted the 2014 elections after Hasina refused to appoint a neutral caretaker government to conduct the vote.\n\nHasina won the next election held in 2018, garnering 96 percent of the votes. Ahead of the elections, Zia was barred from contesting over her convictions, while dozens of BNP candidates were arrested, drawing serious questions about the credibility of the vote.\n\nAn analyst at the time described Hasina’s rule as “development minus democracy”.\n\nHasina’s government repeated that pattern ahead of the 2024 election: opposition parties were attacked, and leaders were arrested ahead of the polls. The BNP boycotted as a result, turning the election into a no-contest.\n\nAfter the victory, Hasina hardened her position, calling the BNP a  ‘terrorist’ organisation .\n\nBut the tables turned – in October 2024, two months after she fled to India, the interim government banned Chhatra League, the student wing of the Awami League, describing it as a “terrorist organisation”.\n\nNow, as Bangladesh prepares for its first post-Hasina election on February 2026, it faces a test. In May, the Yunus government banned the Awami League from all political activity, and as things stand, Hasina’s party will not be able to compete in the upcoming election.\n\nThat is a major setback for the democratic rights of millions of Bangladeshis, who still support the Awami League.\n\nThe step emulates the mistakes of previous governments, which chose retribution over reconciliation.\n\nMeanwhile,  extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances  – a feature of Hasina’s rule – continue under the new government.\n\nConvicting Hasina and sentencing her for her crimes is a critical step towards justice. But Bangladesh can truly move forward from the pain and trauma her government inflicted on the nation only if it breaks with the worst parts of her legacy — by building democratic institutions that are inclusive, genuinely participative, and crucially, non-vindictive."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/19/saudi-arabia-designated-major-non-nato-ally-of-us-gets-f-35-warplanes-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:19+00:00","title":"Saudi Arabia designated major non-NATO ally of US, gets F-35 warplanes deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major diplomatic move, President Donald Trump formally designated Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally during a visit to Washington, DC, marking a significant expansion of U.S.-Saudi military and economic cooperation.

non-NATO ally of US, gets F-35 warplanes deal\n\nPresident Donald Trump has designated Saudi Arabia a major non-NATO ally of the United States during a visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, DC, where the  two leaders reached agreements  covering arms sales, civil nuclear cooperation, artificial intelligence and critical minerals.\n\nDuring a formal black-tie dinner at the White House on Tuesday evening, Trump made the announcement that he was taking “military cooperation to even greater heights by formally designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally”.\n\nTrump said the designation was “something that is very important to them, and I’m just telling you now for the first time because I wanted to keep a little secret for tonight”.\n\nThe designation means a US partner benefits from military and economic privileges but it does not entail security commitments.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the US also signed a “historic strategic defence agreement”, Trump said.\n\nA White House fact sheet said the defence agreement, “fortifies deterrence across the Middle East”, makes it easier for US defence firms to operate in Saudi Arabia and secures “new burden-sharing funds from Saudi Arabia to defray US costs”.\n\nThe White House also announced that Trump had  approved future deliveries of F-35 fighter jets  to Saudi Arabia while the kingdom had agreed to purchase 300 American tanks.\n\n\"I'm pleased to announce that we are taking our military cooperation to even greater heights by formally designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally.\" – President Donald J. Trump 🇺🇸🇸🇦  pic.twitter.com/PXXGGCBPGU\n\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse)  November 19, 2025\n\nSaudi Arabia’s purchase of the stealth fighter jets would mark the first US sale of the advanced fighter planes to Riyadh. The kingdom has reportedly requested to buy 48 of the aircraft.\n\nThe move is seen as a significant policy shift by Washington that could alter the military balance of power in the Middle East, where US law states that Israel must maintain a “qualitative military edge”.\n\nIsrael has been the only country in the Middle East to have the F-35 until now.\n\nAsked by Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett about the impact of the jet fighter deal on Israel’s “qualitative military edge”, Trump said he was aware that Israel would prefer that Riyadh receive warplanes of “reduced calibre”.\n\n“I don’t think that makes you too happy,” Trump said, addressing the crown prince, who was seated beside him in the White House.\n\n“They’ve been a great ally. Israel’s been a great ally. … As far as I’m concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,” Trump said of the F-35 deal.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from the White House, said  part of the almost $1 trillion investment  in the US announced by Prince Mohammed included $142bn for the procurement of the F-35 fighter jets, “the most advanced of their kind in the world”.\n\nFisher also said the Israeli government and lobbyists had tried to block the sale of F-35s to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe agreements announced were about “much more” than Saudi investment in the US, he added.\n\n“It’s about helping each other’s economy, business and defence. Politics isn’t near the top of the agenda, but both countries believe these deals could create a political reset in the Middle East,” Fisher said.\n\nThe two countries also signed a joint declaration on the completion of negotiations on civil nuclear energy cooperation, which the White House said would build the legal foundation for a long-term nuclear energy partnership with Riyadh.\n\nIsraeli officials had suggested that they would not be opposed to Saudi Arabia getting F-35s as long as Saudi Arabia normalises relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords framework.\n\nThe Saudis, however, have said they would join the Abraham Accords but only after there is a credible and guaranteed path to Palestinian statehood, a position  Prince Mohammed repeated in the meeting with Trump .\n\n“We want to be part of the Abraham Accords, but we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path of a two-state solution,” he said.\n\n“We’re going to work on that to be sure that we come prepared for the situation as soon as possible to have that,” he added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/19/live-13-killed-in-israeli-air-attack-on-refugee-camp-in-lebanon?update=4117293","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:42:50+00:00","title":"Multiple Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon kill at least 14 people","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Israeli air attack on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon resulted in the deaths of at least 13 people and multiple injuries.

the deadly collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore last year, according to a months-long investigation by the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).\n\nDue to problems with the wiring, the Dali experienced two blackouts on March 26, 2024, before losing control of propulsion and steering, leading the container ship to crash into the bridge and kill six highway workers, the NTSB said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe bridge collapse created a global media sensation last year when a livestream video of the accident went viral. It was captured by a camera set up to monitor traffic through the Port of Baltimore but instead filmed the swift collapse of a major section of the bridge.\n\nNTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said finding the culprit behind the accident took months of diligent work from the agency’s investigators.\n\n“Our investigators routinely accomplish the impossible, and this investigation is no different,” she said. “The Dali at almost 1,000ft is as long as the Eiffel Tower is high with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Finding this single wire was like hunting for a loose rivet on the Eiffel Tower.”\n\nThe investigation also found that the crew of the Dali tried and failed to steer the ship away from the bridge but was unable to do so due to electrical problems, the NTSB said.\n\nThe agency praised the ship’s pilots for swiftly notifying local authorities of the problems, which led the Maryland Transportation Authority to stop traffic from crossing the nearly 4km-long (2.5-mile-long) bridge.\n\nSeven workers were already on the bridge at the time, the NTSB said, and six were killed in the accident.\n\nThe shipping channel fully reopened in June, but the Maryland Transportation Board said this week that the bridge will not reopen until 2030 and will cost $4.3bn to $5.2bn to repair, according to CBS News."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/19/live-13-killed-in-israeli-air-attack-on-refugee-camp-in-lebanon","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"05:42:50+00:00","title":"Multiple Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon kill at least 14 people","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Israeli air attack on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon killed at least 13 people and injured several, highlighting the ongoing conflict between Israel and Lebanon and raising global concerns about the humanitarian toll of military actions in civilian areas.

for the  World Cup finals  for the first time since 1998 after a hair-raising match against Denmark that saw the Scottish side secure a memorable 4-2 victory with most of the action taking place in the final minutes.\n\nExpectations hung heavy in the night air long before kickoff on Tuesday in Glasgow as Scotland’s date with destiny loomed.\n\nDespite qualifying for the last two European Championships,  World Cup qualification  has proved out of reach for Scotland since France 1998.\n\nYet the Scottish side beat a 10-man Danish side 4-2 in a winner-takes-all match in Group C, with Scott McTominay scoring with a bicycle kick just three minutes into the match, sending Scotland’s supporters at Hampden Park into raptures.\n\nThe early cheers of the Scottish fans were dampened when Denmark’s Rasmus Hojlund levelled the score.\n\nScotland’s Lawrence Shankland then put the home team ahead again, but that too was equalised by Patrick Dorgu in the 82nd minute.\n\nA draw in the game would have given Denmark the group win, and the Danes were in a good position to achieve that result before Kieran Tierney put the Scottish side ahead again three minutes into added time.\n\nKenny McLean then sealed Scotland’s World Cup qualification eight minutes into stoppage time when he chipped a shot over Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel from the halfway line.\n\n“You would not believe it,” one match commentator said when Scotland scored their fourth goal, sending fans into delirium and ensuring the game would become part of the fabled folklore of Scottish football.\n\n“We’ve been

I spoke to them about it pre-match, about how this is the opportunity we’ve waited for,” Scotland coach Steve Clarke said after the game.\n\n“This was the chance, one game. This was like a playoff final. We put everything on the line. There’s always one last step, and it’s always the hardest,” he said.\n\nDenmark, who saw Rasmus Kristensen sent off in the 62nd minute, finished second in the group, two points behind Scotland.\n\nFor much of the game, Denmark appeared to be the superior team. But after an already roller-coaster World Cup qualifying campaign for the Scots, including a 3-2 defeat in Greece on Saturday, the biggest twist was saved to the very end as the two goals in stoppage time prompted the loudest party the city of Glasgow has seen for years.\n\n“That just sums up this squad – never say die. We just keep going right to the end in one of the craziest games,” Scotland captain Andy Robertson said.\n\n“We put the country through it, but I’m sure it’s worth it. We’re going to the World Cup,” he said.\n\nDenmark, who only needed to avoid defeat to make sure of their third successive World Cup finals appearance, were left crestfallen.

missile system to Taiwan\n\nThe United States has announced the sale of an advanced missile system worth almost $700m, which has been battle-tested in Ukraine, its second weapons package in a week, bringing the total to $1bn, to Taiwan, reaffirming its support for Taipei.\n\nMade by RTX, the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) offers medium-range air defence solutions — a new weapon for Taiwan. The Pentagon said on Monday the company was given a firm fixed-price contract for the procurement of NASAMS units, with work estimated to be completed by February 2031.\n\n“Fiscal 2026 foreign military sales [Taiwan] funds in the amount of $698,948,760 were obligated,” it said in a statement.\n\nIn the Asia Pacific region, only Australia and Indonesia currently operate the NASAMS defence, three of which the US said last year Taiwan would receive as part of a $2bn weapons sale.\n\nUsed in Ukraine to defend against the Russian invasion, the system offers a sharp boost in air defence capabilities that the US is exporting to Taiwan as demand for it surges.\n\nThursday’s US approval of the sale of warplanes and other aircraft parts to Taiwan for $330m was its first such deal since President Donald Trump took office in January, prompting thanks from Taipei and anger in Beijing.\n\n“It should be clear today and will remain clear into the future that America’s commitments to Taiwan are rock-solid,” Raymond Greene, the de facto US ambassador in Taipei, told an event of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan on Tuesday.\n\n“We are backing these words with actions, with a focus on supporting Taiwan’s efforts to achieve peace through strength. Nowhere is this more apparent than in our growing defence industrial cooperation.”\n\nThe arms sales announcement comes amid a worsening  diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Tokyo  over Taiwan, after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested on November 7 that her country could intervene militarily in any attack on the self-ruled island.\n\nOn Sunday, Chinese coastguard ships sailed through waters around a group of East China Sea islands controlled by Japan but claimed by China.\n\nJapan said it also scrambled jets on Saturday after China flew a drone between Taiwan and Japan’s westernmost island of Yonaguni.\n\nAsked about the tension on Wednesday, Taiwanese Defence Minister Wellington Koo said China should not resort to force to resolve disputes.\n\n“China should abandon its thinking of using force to resolve things,” he told reporters.\n\nTaiwan’s military is beefing up its armaments to better tackle any attack from China, through efforts such as building its own submarines to defend vital maritime supply lines.\n\nChina’s military operates around Taiwan on an almost daily basis in what Taipei views as a “grey zone” strategy to test and exhaust Taiwan’s forces.\n\nDespite a lack of formal diplomatic ties, the US is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, to the constant anger of Beijing.\n\nChina considers Taiwan part of its territory and has pledged to “reunify” the island with the Chinese mainland, by force if necessary.\n\nMost countries follow China’s demand, but many maintain economic and semiofficial diplomatic ties with Taipei."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1811-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera: Science and Technology","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a range of global developments in science, technology, and politics.

Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A significant G4 geomagnetic storm is forecast to impact Earth this week, triggered by multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun.

northern lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado.

massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1150101665","dateOfPublication":"2023-09-20","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00.000Z","title":"The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Education: A 10-Day Exploration","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An in-depth exploration of the growing role of artificial intelligence in education, covering its applications, ethical challenges, and policy implications.

Build an outfit with this paper doll \n         By Wynne Davis \n        \n           Updated Monday, December 4, 2023 • 9:28 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         I'm training for my first full marathon this year. But it's hard for me to stay motivated when the weather gets cold. Where I live in Washington, D.C., the temperature can have such a wicked bite that I'd rather stay in my cozy bed than go out for a run. How do other runners do it?  To get advice, I turned to Alison Mariella Désir, an athlete, activist and the author of the book  Running While Black: Finding Freedom in a Sport That Wasn't Built for Us . She's the founder of the running collective Harlem Run in New York City. And she's a huge fan of running in the cold. \"I love the cool air on my face. I love the feeling of being really badass because you're one of the only people out there,\" she says.  The key to facing the cold, says Désir, is your outfit. You need to dress for the weather, which means wearing clothing and layers that can protect you from the wind, rain or snow.  And remember — once you get moving, your body is going to feel about 15 to 20 degrees warmer than it actually is outside, according to  the Mayo Clinic. Désir and  Dr. Kelechi Okoroha , an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic, explain what to wear in three different temperatures: when it's in the 50s, when it's in the 30s and when it's below freezing. Make sure to pair all these outfits with a solid pair of running shoes.  When it's in the 50s: Focus on sweat-proof materials The goal in dressing for this weather is anticipating that you're going to start off feeling cold. But once you start running, it's going to feel like the 70s, says Désir,   which is pretty warm. For this reason, layers are your friend, says Okohora.  \"A common mistake in dressing outdoors is dressing too warmly which can cause excessive heat generation and sweating, which ultimately makes you more cold,\" he says. \"So dress in layers that you can remove as soon as you start to sweat — then put them back on as needed.\" Start out with a short-sleeve shirt and shorts (yes, shorts — they're going to give you more of a breeze when you start to warm up), then add a long-sleeve shirt to go over the first layer, says Désir. \"Very quickly that long-sleeve shirt [will] come off and [I'll] tie it around my waist.\"  \"Make sure the layers closest to your body repel water,\" she adds. Moisture-wicking material pulls sweat away from your body without soaking your clothes. This helps regulate your body temperature and keep you dry. Look for sweat-proof shirts, sports bras, shorts and socks made out of synthetic fiber like polyester or nylon. A wool blend works too.  Avoid cotton as your base layer. When cotton gets wet, it stays wet and that can lead to a soggy, miserable run. Running in the 50s checklist Moisture-wicking shirt, bra, shorts and socks  Long-sleeve shirt When it's in the 30s: Add layers and accessories As the temperature drops, add more layers to your base outfit. Start by trading your shorts for leggings. \"If it's 30 degrees, I would go out wearing sweat-wicking tights and another layer [of tights or pants] on top of that. Or I would wear fleece-lined tights,\" says Désir.  For the top half of your body, keep the moisture-wicking layers and the long-sleeve shirt, then put on a light windbreaker jacket or an insulated vest for extra warmth. Then consider your accessories, says Désir. Keep your ears toasty by donning a hat, a fleece headband or earmuffs. Wear breathable, moisture-wicking  gloves . As for your feet, switch from regular socks to wool socks to keep those toes warm and dry. Wet socks can soften the skin — and the heat, moisture and friction from running can cause blisters to form.  Running in the 30s checklist In addition to the items above, add:  Fleece-lined tights Lightweight windbreaker Insulated vest Earmuffs, fleece headband or hat Gloves Wool socks  When it's below 30: Consider your face, neck and safety When the temperature dips below freezing, I don't know that I personally want to run outside. But if you do, put on all your previous layers, says Désir. They'll continue to keep you warm in this weather. Add a balaclava, scarf or neck gaiter to protect your face and neck from the chilly air (you can pull the gaiter or arrange the scarf over your nose and mouth).  And if the streets are wet from the rain or slushy from the snow, switch to running shoes that have a good tread on the bottom and are made with a waterproof material like Gore-Tex. They can help keep your feet dry and give you a little more grip on slippery surfaces when you run.  In these conditions, you might also want to slow down your pace and shorten your stride to avoid slipping and falling, says Désir.  Keep your head up too and avoid looking at the ground. \"Rain often makes us look down directly at our feet, meaning we might miss hazards ahead of us,\" she adds. She recommends a waterproof hat with a brim that can allow you to see more clearly and stay dry. You should also consider how dark it's going to be when you're outside. There are fewer hours of sunlight in the winter — and rain or snow can lead to gray skies that decrease your visibility. Wear light-colored running clothes and reflective gear, like a light-up safety vest, so that drivers and pedestrians can see you on the road, says Désir.  Running below 30 degrees checklist In addition to the items above, add:  Balaclava, neck gaiter or scarf Waterproof running shoes with good grip Safety vest  Is it ever too cold to exercise outside?  Okoroha of the Mayo Clinic says there are times when you should opt for a treadmill run or another type of indoor workout. Before exercising in cold weather, make sure it's safe for you to do so, says Okoroha. People with medical conditions such as asthma, heart disease or  Raynaud's disease,  which can cause body parts to feel numb or cold, should check with their doctor first as these conditions may be exacerbated by the cold. Once you get the green light, the first thing to do is check the temperature.  \"If the wind chill or the temperature is below zero degrees, consider indoor activity because the chances of frostbite are higher,\" Okoroha says.  Frostbite happens when it's so cold that \"your blood flow gets concentrated in your body's core and leaves other areas like your hands, your feet, your head, your ears, [which then] become vulnerable to frostbite.\"  You also want to check for rain, snow or other precipitation before you go out. \"Getting wet makes you more vulnerable to cold and should be avoided if possible,\" he adds.  That's also when hypothermia, a condition that happens when your body temperature is abnormally low, can become a risk.  It's most common when temperatures are extremely frigid, though it can happen with temperatures in the 40s if you are already chilly from wet conditions, like sweat or rain,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .  The good news is that wearing outfits made up of layers can help prevent both frostbite and hypothermia, Okoroha says — so be diligent about checking the temperature before you head out and   wearing the appropriate gear. As for me, this guidance has made it easier for me to get my winter runs in. Last week, I went out in my fleece-lined leggings and puffer vest in 30-degree weather after some rain and it was refreshing. I'm not ready to say I love the cold like Désir does, but I am learning to enjoy it more. This episode of Life Kit was produced by Clare Marie Schneider.

I'm Marielle Segarra. And I'm joined by NPR's Wynne Davis. Hey, Wynne. WYNNE DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Marielle. So I heard you like to run. SEGARRA: I do. DAVIS: Same here. But what about when it's cold out? SEGARRA: You know, if it's less than 40 degrees, I'm probably not going to do it, to be honest. DAVIS: Yeah. This is something that I struggle with, too. You know, in the winter, it's extremely hard for me to get out of the door and go for a run or a bike ride because it's just so cold out. But not everyone feels that way. ALISON MARIELLA DESIR: Unpopular opinion - I love running in the cold. It is my absolute favorite time of year. And it's funny because my husband hates the cold and loves running in the summer, so opposites truly do attract. SEGARRA: That's Alison Mariella Desir. She's a mother, an athlete, an activist and the author of the book \"Running While Black.\" DESIR: I just love it. I love the cool air on my face. I love the feeling of being really badass because you're one of the only people out there. I love the clothing. I love layers - literally everything. SEGARRA: It sounds like she's got a whole system. DAVIS: Yeah, she does. And we'll get into it soon. In this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to talk to experts about what motivates them to get outside when it's cold. We'll hear safety tips for the winter months, and we'll learn how to build an outfit that will keep you warm so you can get moving. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: OK, Wynne, so I feel like one of the big barriers that keeps people from running outside in the cold is it's just so cold, right? Like, it can be super uncomfortable, and running already involves some level of pain. So this is really a psychological barrier. I just wonder where Alison gets the motivation to get out there. DAVIS: Right. So much of running is mental. Alison says it can depend on if she's training for a race. In that case, you know, she wants to get her miles in so that when race day comes, she's ready. But she also reminds herself that she feels better, both mentally and physically, after a run. So going outside, even when it's cold, will give her a boost later. SEGARRA: OK. That's the mindset part. But then once you get outside, it is still going to be cold. So what do you do to prepare for the physical challenge - right? - the rain, the chill? DAVIS: Yes. You have to prepare for the elements. And obviously, a big part of that is how you dress. So in the summer, you're trying to stay cool, but in the winter, you want to be warm. You don't want to overheat. Both the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic note that when you get moving, you're going to feel about 20 degrees warmer than it actually is outside. And Alison had some good advice on how to build your ideal outfit so you can get out the door depending on the temperature. DESIR: Let's say it's, like, 50 degrees outside. So the air is crisp, but the sun is peeking out. Bear with me now. I would wear shorts, a short-sleeved shirt that is a wicking material and then a long-sleeved shirt over that. And I would start out very cold, but very quickly, that long-sleeved shirt would come off, and I would tie it around my waist, and I would be sweating, right? Because when you're moving - 50 degrees - it will feel like 70 degrees by the time you get moving. DAVIS: Alison said she might also add things like gloves or a headband, and then she'll make adjustments throughout the run based on how she feels. SEGARRA: OK. I do have to say, for a New Yorker, 50 degrees is actually totally reasonable. Like, some people might even call that ideal running weather. DAVIS: Yeah. I'd have absolutely no problem running in that weather. And we can talk about when it gets colder. But, you know, this is cold for some people who live in California, Florida, whatever. SEGARRA: OK. Yeah. That's fair. What is the wicking material she mentioned? DAVIS: Yeah. The moisture-wicking material - what it does is it pulls the sweat you're making away from your body without soaking your clothes. Essentially, it's there to help keep you dry and keep your body temperature where it needs to be. You can go for a synthetic fiber here, like polyester or nylon. Or a wool blend works, too. The big thing is you just don't want anything made of cotton because that's going to get wet and stay wet, and then you're going to be cold and miserable. SEGARRA: So what about when it gets colder, like in the 30s? DAVIS: This is when you're really going to start building more layers or kind of stepping up an existing layer. DESIR: If it's 30 degrees, I would go out wearing a base layer of tights - you know, some wicking tights underneath and then maybe another layer on top of that, or I would wear fleece-lined tights. On top, I would wear a wicking short-sleeved shirt. SEGARRA: Again, here's the plug for wicking material. Alison says that that base layer that repels water sets the foundation for the rest of the outfit. DESIR: Then I would wear a long-sleeved shirt over that, and I would definitely wear a jacket, a running jacket. I would wear something over my ears. I'm not really a hat person. I have a massive head. So I would wear, like, earmuffs, and I would wear gloves. SEGARRA: OK. And what about when it's really cold outside, like, frigid, don't-want-to-leave-your-house cold? I'm talking, you know, 2 degrees. DAVIS: At this point, I don't know that I personally would want to go outside. But if you do, this is where you want to start adding some extra protections for your face, like one of those neck gaiters that you can pull up and down. But you also need to think about keeping your feet warm and dry. That's where a good pair of wool socks comes in. If it's wet or slushy outside, Alison says that a pair of running sneakers with Gore-Tex or another waterproof material can help, too. And this can also really help you avoid those uncomfortable blisters, which are the worst. SEGARRA: So this sounds like potentially a lot of gear. I wonder, does it get super-expensive? DAVIS: It can because, you know, a lot of athletic wear isn't cheap. But Alison says that the most important thing here is the sweat-wicking layer, a pair of wool socks and one good pair of shoes. Everything else you can build on as time goes by. You don't need to have every piece of specialized gear to get outside and go for your run. SEGARRA: All right. So what else should people keep in mind before they head out the door to run in the cold? DAVIS: Safety is a big one. In the winter, there aren't as many hours of light. So more people might end up running in the dark. DESIR: I want to also say that I hate these kinds of conversations only because the world is unsafe, and therefore we must change our behavior to take care of ourselves when it really should be, how can we make the world a safer place for us? SEGARRA: Yeah, I get that. I mean, it's frustrating. I pretty much only run during the day for safety reasons. And in the winter, that is a lot harder. So sometimes I'll try to run in the afternoon when I'm working remotely, but it's not always possible. DAVIS: Yeah. And Alison talks about this in her book, too. DESIR: You know, it's not often that I can run smack in the middle of the day. So thinking about running with my partner or linking up with a local running group - as a woman, as a Black woman, I rarely go out by myself in general but, in the winter, even less because I don't want to end up in a sticky situation by myself in the dark. DAVIS: Alison gave us some of her must-haves for staying safe. The first is a huge one for her, and it might surprise some people. DESIR: First and foremost, I would say never run with headphones. SEGARRA: I feel like that might be a hard one for folks. DAVIS: Yeah. I mean, I can definitely understand why. I really like to run with music. I do have headphones that allow me to hear the street noise, but ultimately, the music is still a distraction. SEGARRA: OK, so no headphones. What else? DAVIS: Reflective gear is also really important because when it's dark out, you want to be as visible as possible to those who are driving cars. But, you know, sometimes you have to be outside at night. And in those cases or even when you're with a buddy, Alison says it's a good idea to let people know where you are through a tracking app. DESIR: I use Strava. It allows me to send a notification to people to let them know where I am and that I'm out on the road. So, God forbid, you do slip on something and you end up unable to move, you know, you have that app. SEGARRA: Are there any privacy concerns here? - 'cause it sounds potentially creepy if people can see where you are at all times. DAVIS: Yeah. Strava has faced some criticism about privacy issues in the past, but you can make it so that only people who follow you see your activity. And it is possible to hide the start and finish points of your run so people won't know your exact route even if they follow you. SEGARRA: All right. So you can take some precautions. DAVIS: Definitely. And, you know, there are plenty of other apps out there that can share your location, including the Find My app for Apple users. But there are some other things that are good to take with you just in case. DESIR: Always bring some amount of money and an ID. So those are sort of, you know, things that are on my list to take with me and always just to, again, acknowledge I'm a Black woman moving outdoors, which is often a white space - keep my head on a swivel. SEGARRA: OK. So we've been talking about safety in general, but what about when it comes to medical conditions, right? You are going to be exercising in potentially extreme situations. DAVIS: Yep. And here I talked to Dr. Kelechi Okoroha. He is an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic. He said that certain conditions like asthma, heart disease and Raynaud's disease may be exacerbated by the cold. KELECHI OKOROHA: So I think the first thing you need to do is make sure exercising outdoors is safe for you. So that means if you have a medical condition, you need to consult with your doctor to make sure your condition or medication does not preclude you from safely exercising outdoors. SEGARRA: OK. So you determine that it's safe for you personally to exercise outside in the cold. But I know that, you know, in the summer, people are often told to look out for signs of heatstroke when it's really hot out. What should they be watching out for in the cold? DAVIS: Frostbite and hypothermia. Here's how Dr. Okoroha explains frostbite. OKOROHA: Frostbite is an injury to the body that's caused by freezing. And what happens is when it's cold, your blood flow gets concentrated in your body's core, and it leaves other areas like your hands, your feet, your head, your ears. And that becomes vulnerable to frostbite. DAVIS: So the symptoms start with cold skin and a prickling feeling. Numbness and discoloration of the skin happen when it gets worse. SEGARRA: OK. And how does frostbite differ from hypothermia? DAVIS: So hypothermia is when you have an abnormally low body temp. OKOROHA: And so when you're exposed to cold temperatures, your body begins to lose heat faster than it can be produced. And so exercising in cold or rainy weather can increase your risk of hypothermia. Some signs and symptoms of hypothermia are things like intense shivering, slurred speech, loss of coordination or even fatigue. SEGARRA: What happens if someone starts to recognize the symptoms for either one? DAVIS: With both hypothermia and frostbite, Dr. Okoroha says it's important to get out of the cold as soon as you can and slowly begin to warm yourself up. Going slow here is really important because if you've lost feeling in your hands, for example, you really might not be able to recognize the temperature of things. So you might be using water, and it might actually be way too hot, and you could end up burning yourself. Ultimately, though, if the conditions persist, you should seek medical treatment from a doctor or an emergency room. SEGARRA: Is it ever too cold to run outside? DAVIS: Yes. It does reach a certain point where you should not go out. OKOROHA: Generally, we recommend if the wind chill or the temperature is below zero degrees, you should consider indoor activity because the chances of frostbite are higher. And then additionally, you also want to check the moisture level because getting wet makes you more vulnerable to cold and should be avoided if possible. SEGARRA: All right. So be careful if the temperatures are low. Another thing I'm wondering is about snow, right? Like, it's very easy to fall down if you slip on ice, even if you're just walking. So can people run in the snow? Like, what do they have to think about? DAVIS: Yes. You can run in the snow. You just really want to be careful. I looked into this, and the consensus is that you want to take it slow, and you want to shorten your stride so that you are less likely to fall. And you should still watch out for ice if the snow isn't fresh or if it has snowed and then rained. SEGARRA: OK. So you know what? I feel pretty good about this. Now I know how to build my outfit if I'm running outside, what I'm looking out for in terms of frostbite and hypothermia and then, just in general, how to be safe. Is it go time? Can I go for a run? DAVIS: I think so. I think we're just about ready. The only other things that people should keep in mind that they, you know, might otherwise forget are that sunscreen is still a must even if it's cloudy out, even if it's cold. You can still get sunburn in any weather. And, you know, everyone needs to remember to hydrate before your run, after your run and during your run. SEGARRA: Yeah. These are evergreen tips, actually. Wear sunscreen. Drink water. DAVIS: Yep. You've got it. And now I'd say we should get out there. SEGARRA: Let's do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

2025-11-12T15:41:35+00:00\n\nTitle: World’s ‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty\n\nThe expansion of  fossil fuel infrastructure  is threatening billions of lives around the globe, Amnesty International has said in a new report, urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are racing to study 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to pass through our solar system, which was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has expanded its social media ban for children under 16 to include Reddit and Kick, alongside Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center reveals that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells.

model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m3ddkn3gdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"11:57:48.036+00:00","title":"Wicked: For Good leaves critics less spellbound than the first film","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wicked: For Good, the sequel to the 2024 film Wicked, features Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande reprising their roles as Elphaba and Glinda, with Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Yeoh, and Jonathan Bailey in supporting roles.

Heights and Now You See Me 2.\n\nChu is also set to direct a new big-screen adaptation of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, pencilled in for release in 2027.\n\nMany critics highlighted Grande's performance in Wicked: For Good, with several predicting another supporting actress nomination at the Oscars in March.\n\nVariety's Peter Debruge said  the pop star shows \"fragility\" in her more \"nuanced\" performance.\n\n\"Whereas Grande had a relatively one-dimensional role to play in part one, Glinda now faces a complex evolution,\" he said.\n\n\"Grande has been acting since she was a kid,\"  noted the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney,  \"and her quiet moments of introspection, anxiety or sadness show tender depths, as does her loyalty to Elphaba.\"\n\nBut he also praised her co-star. \"Make no mistake, Erivo remains a powerhouse, with pipes that shake the heavens and a wellspring of unforced emotional intensity that never runs dry.\"\n\n\"What a performance from Erivo,\"  agreed the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw  in a four-star review.\n\nHe added the sequel as a whole \"keeps the rainbow-coloured dreaminess and the Broadway show tune zinginess from part one\".\n\nThe stage musical was split into two parts for its film adaptation, but the two movies were filmed in one go.\n\nThe first was released last November and grossed more than £750m at the box office worldwide.\n\nIt went on to win two Oscars and two Baftas, for costume and production design, as well as the cinematic and box office achievement prize at the Golden Globes.\n\nOne problem facing the sequel is that most of Wicked's best-known songs, including Popular and The Wizard and I, appeared in the first film.\n\nIt's a problem it shares with the Broadway and West End musical. \"On stage, the second act lacks a song as strong as Defying Gravity,\" Debruge noted.\n\nIn his Empire review, Nugent concluded: \"The tone is different from that of the first film: less peppy, more glum.\n\n\"With the exception of Goldblum - who appears to be acting in his own film, delighting in stuttery drollness - all the characters are much less cheerful than they were last time around, and as a result it's less enjoyable for us to watch.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70922w8z8wo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"10:52:36.492+00:00","title":"Daniel Radcliffe reveals 'sweet' response to

Minaj said on Tuesday at an event organised by the US, adding: \"Churches have been burned, families have been torn apart... simply because of how they pray.\"\n\nAnalysts say that jihadists and other armed groups have waged campaigns of violence that affect all communities in the West African nation, regardless of background or belief.\n\nThis week alone, two people were killed in an attack on a church, while a group of 25 girls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were abducted from a school.\n\nTwo of the girls later  managed to escape from their abductors.  A teacher and a security guard - both Muslim - were also killed in the attack on the secondary school in the north-western Kebbi state.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria  \"guns a-blazing\"  if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".\n\nMinaj, whose real name is Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty, told an event organised by the US embassy to the UN in New York that calling for the protection of Christians in Nigeria was \"not about taking sides or dividing people... but about uniting humanity\".\n\n\"This is about standing up in the face of injustice. It's about what I've always stood for,\" she added.\n\nThe 42-year-old rapper, who has previously spoken of her Christian faith, thanked Trump for \"prioritising this issue and for his leadership\".\n\nThe Nigerian government has pushed back on these claims, describing them as \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".\n\nAn official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".\n\nOther groups monitoring political violence in Nigeria say most victims of the jihadist groups are Muslims.\n\nThe country's 220 million people are roughly evenly split between followers of the two religions, with Muslims in the majority in the north, where most attacks take place.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nigeria police in the south-western Kwara state confirmed a deadly attack on a church in the town of Eruku, where gunmen opened fire on worshipers the previous day, killing two people and abducting several others.\n\nLocal media say armed men, identified by residents as bandits, stormed the Christ Apostolic Church during an evening programme on Tuesday evening, shooting the pastor and rounding up worshippers at gunpoint.\n\nImages and short video clips - believed to be from the church's CCTV cameras - have circulated widely online, showing terrified people scrambling for safety, including an elderly woman seen desperately trying to escape the gunmen.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Bola Tinubu confirmed that jihadist forces had killed a senior army officer, after he had been captured in an ambush.\n\nThe Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap) said on Monday its fighters had killed Brigadier General Musa Uba in the north-eastern state of Borno.\n\nThe Nigerian army had earlier denied that the officer had been abducted and killed.\n\nThe latest attacks have triggered frustration and anger across Nigeria, with many lamenting what they see as an unending wave of insecurity affecting rural communities, churches, schools and major transport routes.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, President Tinubu said he was \"fully apprised of the recent uptick in violent extremism\" across the country, adding that the surge had left him \"depressed\".\n\nHe directed security agencies to respond with \"urgency, clarity, and decisive action\" to what he described as attacks by the \"heartless terrorists\".\n\nMinaj described Nigeria as \"a beautiful nation with deep faith traditions\" and even acknowledged the \"beautiful Barbz\" - her fans - in the West African country.\n\nThe US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz,  thanked the rapper  for \"leveraging her massive platform to spotlight the atrocities against Christians in Nigeria\".\n\nFor months, right-wing campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants were systematically targeting Christians in Nigeria.\n\nBut the BBC has found that some of the data being relied on to come to this conclusion is difficult to verify .\n\nDeadly disputes are also often over vital resources like land and water or fuelled by inter-ethnic tensions, rather than religion, say analysts.\n\nLast year Minaj publicly revealed that despite moving from her native Trinidad to New York at an early age,  she still does not have US citizenship .\n\nHer appearance at the UN on Tuesday is her highest-profile political intervention to date.\n\nShe made headlines during the pandemic for sharing  disinformation about side-effects of the Covid vaccine  - claiming that when a friend of her cousin had the jab, it caused his testicles to swell up and he became impotent.\n\n\"His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding,\"  Minaj wrote online .\n\nHer comments were  criticised by the UK's chief medical officer at the time , and then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson also commented, joking: \"I am not as familiar with the works of Nicki Minaj as I probably should be.\"\n\nIn recent months, her years-long feud with fellow New York rapper Cardi B escalated to them  trading insults about each others' careers and family members .\n\nAdditional reporting by BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50nvq8znvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"00:11:42.806+00:00","title":"When will the Epstein files be released now that the Senate has agreed to make them public?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Congress has passed a bipartisan resolution requiring the Justice Department to release all files related to the investigation into convicted financier Jeffrey Epstein, including materials from the Epstein estate and potentially documents involving co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell and government officials.

It could also include internal justice department documents.\n\nThe vote comes just  two days after Trump wrote on Truth Social to encourage Republicans to vote for the measure . In the post, he argued that \"we have nothing to hide\".\n\nBefore Trump's post, some House Republicans had made clear they were willing to break ranks with the president and House Speaker Mike Johnson to vote in favour.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate quickly agreed to pass the measure on Tuesday evening.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune had previously suggested that while he was \"not hearing\" much desire from fellow Republicans to push for the release of the documents, a successful House vote could change that.\n\nThe Republican has been under enormous pressure from both sides of the US political spectrum and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer requested unanimous consent on the Senate floor to \"immediately\" pass the bill to release all the unclassified files. No one objected so the measure was approved.\n\nAnother Republican, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, had previously told NBC's Meet the Press only that the Senate would \"take a look\" at the bill if it passes the House.\n\n\"We'll see what it says,\" Barrasso said. \"We all want accountability and transparency. But to me, this it not about the truth. It's not about justice.\"\n\n\"This is about an attempt by the Democrats to make President Trump a lame-duck president,\" he added. \"And I'm not going to aid and abet them in their efforts to do that.\"\n\nThe bill will head from the Senate to President Trump, who has said he would sign it into law.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday night, he said Republicans had \"nothing to do with Epstein\".\n\n\"It's really a Democrat problem,\" he said. \"The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.\"\n\nTrump went on to argue the Epstein scandal was a \"hoax\" distracting from \"the greatness of what the Republican Party had accomplished over the last period of time\".\n\nAs the Senate agreed to pass the bill on Tuesday, Trump said that it didn't matter to him and cast the whole thing as a distraction.\n\n\"I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had,\" he wrote in a social media post, listing wins that ranged from  the passage of his budget bill over the summer  to the end of the 43-day government shutdown.\n\nThere are obstacles to the files being released even if Trump signs the bill.\n\nThe text of the document that went before the House, for example, noted that the attorney general could withhold or redact portions of records that contain personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\".\n\n\"Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,\" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC.\n\n\"There may also be some issues about law enforcement techniques that the justice department might not want to be out there in the public domain,\" he added.\n\nThe House bill also noted that the justice department can hold back any documents that \"jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\".\n\nThat could potentially lead to delays, given that President Trump has called for investigations into Epstein's links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clinton  and Larry Summers , \"to determine what was going on with them, and him\".\n\n\"That's a potential hurdle,\" Prof Entin said. \"If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.\"\n\nDoing so, he added, \"might create some prejudicial publicity about targets of the investigation\" that could ultimately lead to intense litigation if any indictments are brought.\n\nFor those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns that Trump's order to the justice department to investigate Epstein's ties could slow the release of the files.\n\n\"I'm concerned that now he's opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" Representative Thomas Massie said on Tuesday.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican now in  a public row with Trump over the files ,  has also said the documents may be \"tied up\" in Trump's investigation into Democrats.\n\n\"I believe the country deserves transparency in these files,\" Greene told CNN on Sunday.\n\n\"I have no idea what's in the files. I can't even guess,\" Greene added. \"But that is the question everyone is asking is - why fight this so hard?\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl2g195n96o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"00:48:25.382+00:00","title":"Clay Higgins: The lone lawmaker to vote against releasing the Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a rare moment of bipartisan consensus, nearly every Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of a bill to release documents tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with only Clay Higgins, a Republican from Louisiana, voting against it.

Representatives voted on a bill  to compel the release of documents tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe lone \"nay\" came from the Republican lawmaker from Louisiana, Clay Higgins, who defied his party saying his vote was a principled \"NO\".\n\n\"What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today,\" Higgins wrote on X. \"It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America.\"\n\nThe resounding vote in favour of the Epstein bill, 427-1, marks a rare moment of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Hours later, the US senate too approved the legislation, clearing the way for the final act - President Donald Trump's signature.\n\nFor Higgins, safeguarding the personal information of Epstein's many victims was the primary issue with the legislation.\n\n\"As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,\" he wrote on X. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt.\"\n\nHiggins said he would support the bill if it were to be amended by the Senate, which Republican majority leader John Thune had already suggested was unlikely.\n\n\"When a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1 and the president said he's going to sign it, I'm not sure that amending it is in the cards,\" Thune said before the Senate's unanimous approval for the bill on Tuesday.\n\nPrior to the House passing the legislation, only four Republicans had joined all Democrats in signing a petition to force a vote - Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert, Nancy Mace and Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nBut it achieved overwhelming Republican support after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote.\n\nHiggins has represented Louisiana's third district since 2017 and is widely regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress, according to his website.\n\nHis holdout vote in the wake of 200-plus members of his party voting otherwise is not the first time he has taken an unorthodox stance.\n\nIn 2024, House Republicans voted to censure Higgins for offensive remarks he made on social media after he called Haiti \"the nastiest country in the western hemisphere\" and referred to Haitians as \"eating pets\" and \"slapstick gangsters\".\n\n\"All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,\" Higgins wrote.\n\nFacebook removed two posts from Higgins in 2020, after he wrote he would \"drop any 10 of you where you stand\", referring to any armed protesters that might attend a Louisiana demonstration against police brutality.\n\nFacebook told Business Insider at the time the posts \"were removed for violating our policies against inciting violence\".\n\nBefore Congress, Higgins was a member of Louisiana's St Landry's Parish Sheriff's Office. He resigned in 2016 amid backlash about a controversial anti-crime video where he was seen holding a rifle and making threats against gang members.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Higgins's office for comment."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxr1r34ev9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"11:07:40.921+00:00","title":"Epstein files bill to be sent to Trump after approval from Congress","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Both chambers of Congress have passed a bipartisan bill requiring the U.S. Department of Justice to release all unclassified records related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, including victim interviews, communications, flight logs, and investigative materials.

to be sent to Trump after approval from Congress\n\nBoth chambers of US Congress have agreed to order the US justice department to release its files on late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the measure in a 427-1 vote. The Senate said it would pass the bill before it officially received it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump must ultimately sign off the measure, which he has said he will do. He recently reversed his position and urged fellow Republicans to vote to disclose the records, following pushback from many of his supporters.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, survivors of Epstein spoke in support of the measure at the US Capitol. One of them said they had suffered \"institutional betrayal\" for years.\n\nThe \"Epstein files\" refer to the vast trove of documents that were amassed during criminal investigations into the financier, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items confiscated from raids of his various properties.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN that he expected the upper chamber to receive the bill from the lower one on Wednesday morning, after which the bill would be passed and then sent to Trump for the presidential signature.\n\nTrump said the timing did not matter to him and has continued to cast the issue as a distraction. \"I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had,\" he wrote in a social media post late on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nTrump's own historical relationship with Epstein has again been the subject of recent headlines after US lawmakers released more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate - including some that mention Trump and other prominent figures, without indicating any wrongdoing by those individuals.\n\nTrump’s reversal at the weekend - from attacking those on Capitol Hill who wanted the files released to saying there was “nothing to hide” - surprised some in Washington.\n\nThe Republican congressional leadership was caught off guard after aligning their message with the president for the past few weeks and opposing the release of the files.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson had repeatedly called the push to release the Epstein files a \"Democrat hoax\". But on Tuesday, he voted in support of release.\n\nRepublican Clay Higgins, of Louisiana, and cited his concern about “innocent people being hurt” with the release of the information.\n\nThe measure had been expected to take a few days to reach the US Senate, but after the resounding afternoon vote in the House, the timeline quickly sped up.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer brought up the bill on the floor of the Senate under a procedure called unanimous consent. Because no one objected, there was no debate and no amendments added to the bill.\n\nA congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own.\n\nThe bill requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” related to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell no later than 30 days after the law is enacted.\n\nThose materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs and people and entities connected to Epstein.\n\nBut there are obstacles to the files being released even if Trump signs the bill as he has said he will do.\n\nFor example, the bill gives Bondi the power to withhold information that would jeopardise any active federal investigation or identifies any victims. Trump recently asked the justice department to investigate Epstein's alleged links to major banks and several prominent Democrats.\n\nEpstein was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 in what a coroner ruled was a suicide.\n\nHe was being held on charges of sex trafficking, having previously been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.\n\nDuring two criminal investigations into Epstein, thousands of documents were gathered, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses.\n\nTrump and Epstein previously socialised in similar circles, but the president has repeatedly said he cut ties with Epstein many years ago, before Epstein's 2008 conviction. The president also said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal activity.\n\nLast week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email chains, including correspondence between Epstein and Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nSome of those make mention of Trump and other prominent figures. In one email, sent in 2011, Epstein wrote to Maxwell: “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.”\n\nThe White House said last week that the victim referenced in the email was prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n\nGiuffre, who died in April, said that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse and there is no implication of any wrongdoing by Trump or the other high-profile figures mentioned in the emails.\n\nSpeaking after the vote, Giuffre's brother Sky Roberts praised her sister's role in seeking justice for Epstein survivors.\n\n\"She did it, she paved the way... She paved the way for us to come forward as advocates, for her survivor sisters to come forward, and we won't stop,\" Roberts said.\n\nTrump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".\n\nThe push for the release of the investigative files held by the Department of Justice was led by Republican Thomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman who sometimes dissents from his party, and Democrat Ro Khanna, a California congressman, both of whom introduced the legislation.\n\nMassie has faced criticism from Trump for his push to release the files, but has stood firm.\n\n“In 2030, he’s not going to be the president,” Massie said to ABC News over the weekend. He added that fellow Republicans who voted against release \"will have voted to protect paedophiles”.\n\nAnother Republican who has pushed for the release of the files is House Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. She had been a staunch supporter of Trump before the two fell out over the issue, with the president now calling her a \"traitor\".\n\nAt a news conference earlier in the day on Tuesday, Greene said she was speaking up on behalf of Epstein's survivors.\n\n\"Let me tell you what a traitor is. A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves; a patriot is an American that serves the United States of America and Americans like the women standing behind me,\" Greene said.\n\nShe said that the row over Epstein has been one of the \"most destructive things\" to Trump's Make America Great Again movement since his election in 2016.\n\nSurvivors of Epstein’s abuse also spoke at the news conference, urging lawmakers to release the files and pushing Trump to do the same.\n\nEpstein survivor Annie Farmer said that keeping the files under wraps amounted to “institutional betrayal”.\n\n“Because these crimes were not properly investigated, so many more girls and women were harmed,” Ms Farmer said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xzgw623go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"23:00:46.207+00:00","title":"Pinkfong: How the viral Baby Shark video created a $400m business","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article traces the journey of Pinkfong, a South Korean children's content company, from a tiny startup with just three employees in 2010 to a $400 million media enterprise.

June 2016 to publish a 90-second clip of a children's song, he had no idea what he was unleashing.\n\nIt became a global phenomenon, clocking up more than 16 billion views -  YouTube's most watched video ever .\n\nThat song was the incredibly catchy Baby Shark.\n\nNot only has it  captivated toddlers and terrorised adults around the world,  it laid the foundations for its creator Pinkfong to become a media business worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n“We didn’t expect it to stand out from our other content,\" Mr Kim, Pinkfong's chief executive, told the BBC from the firm's headquarters in Seoul.\n\n\"But looking back, it became a major turning point that set the stage for our global journey.”\n\nOn Tuesday, that journey took Pinkfong to the South Korean stock market, where its shares rose by more than 9% on their debut, giving it a valuation of more than $400m (£304m).\n\nFounded in 2010 as SmartStudy, the firm made digital content for children up to 12 years of age.\n\nIt had just three employees, including Mr Kim and the firm's chief technology officer, Dongwoo Son.\n\n\"The office was tiny - even smaller than this,\" recalled Mr Kim, gesturing to the conference room he was calling from.\n\nIt was so small \"we didn't even expect a salary at the time\", he said through a translator.\n\nPinkfong went through several major overhauls, including shifting its focus to toddlers.\n\nThe firm grew to around 100 employees and prioritised simpler, learning-based games and content. \"And that's when Baby Shark emerged,\" Mr Kim said.\n\nThe firm has been known as The Pinkfong Company since 2022, a name inspired by a cheerful and curious fox that featured in one of its early cartoons.\n\nIt now has around 340 employees, with offices in Tokyo, Shanghai and Los Angeles.\n\nBaby Shark is believed to have originated in the US in the 1970s and was often sung at children's summer camps.\n\nThe song, which repeats the phrase \"Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo\" is \"attractive for children, though possibly annoying for adults,\" said media analyst Kevin Chew from the Nanyang Technological University.\n\nMr Kim is also very aware of just how catchy it is.\n\n\"It's like a K-pop song. It's very fast-paced, rhythmical and it's addictive,\" he said, adding that the tune has a \"chanting\" effect, which makes it easy for children to remember.\n\nBut it was not an instant hit and only gained traction when its dance routine was featured at children's events in South East Asia.\n\nVideos of children and adults dancing to the song started to spread online and the clip went viral.\n\nThere was a \"festival-like feeling\" in the Pinkfong office, as the team watched its viewing numbers soar, Mr Kim said.\n\nIn November 2020, the Baby Shark clip claimed the title of YouTube's most viewed.\n\nIt generated around half of the firm's revenue in the years immediately after the video's release and became a springboard for new content and merchandise, he said.\n\nBut Pinkfong faced a legal challenge in 2019 when it was accused of  plagiarising the work of an American composer .\n\nSouth Korea's Supreme Court rejected the case, after the company argued that its version was derived from a folk song in the public domain.\n\nThe victory, Mr Kim said, gave the firm a lift as its shares went public. He added that the stock market application had been filed before the verdict was announced.\n\nPinkfong's other franchises like Bebefinn and Sealook are growing fast but the firm must prove its success is not just reliant on Baby Shark, said Korea University business lecturer Min Jung Kim.\n\nThe company's target audience is a major plus as toddlers tend to watch the same material repeatedly, she said.\n\nKim Min-seok insists his business can grow beyond Baby Shark, which currently accounts for about a quarter of Pinkfong's revenue. Meanwhile, Bebefinn has leapt ahead, generating roughly 40% of the firm's earnings.\n\nOne parent told the BBC that his family has mixed feelings about Pinkfong's videos.\n\nFather of two Saleem Nashef said he appreciates the educational qualities of the firm's content but his wife thinks Baby Shark is \"too over-stimulating for kids\".\n\nStill, the viral video is apparently inescapable, as his daughter, who is about to turn three, will have a Baby Shark-themed birthday party.\n\nWhether Pinkfong can create other characters to match Baby Shark's commercial appeal remains unclear, said Prof Kim.\n\nIt raised almost $52m in its stock market debut and plans to use the money to expand its line-up of films and characters, said Mr Kim.\n\nThe company also aims to become a \"tech-driven\" content creator, using viewing patterns and other data to shape its new projects.\n\nPinkfong has already achieved \"what many creators have always dreamed of,\" Mr Kim said.\n\nBut now it must show investors that it is not just a one-hit wonder.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rachel Lee from the  Asia Specific podcast"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0gdkwp2p9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"04:55:27.348+00:00","title":"'Things happen' - Trump defends Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi killing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent White House meeting, US President Donald Trump defended Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, asserting that he had no knowledge of the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, contradicting a 2021 US intelligence report that found the Crown Prince had approved a plan to capture or kill Khashoggi.

- Trump defends Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi killing\n\nUS President Donald Trump said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.\n\nTrump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.\n\nThe crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right things\" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called \"painful\".\n\nIt was his first US visit since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through the US-Saudi relationship.\n\nIn the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about the killing.\n\n\"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,\" the US president said.\n\n\"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\"\n\n\"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it,\" Trump added. \"You don't have to embarrass our guests.\"\n\nThe crown prince added that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate the murder, which he called \"painful\" and a \"huge mistake\".\n\nA US intelligence report made public in 2021  - under President Joe Biden's administration - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report.\n\nWhile dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none directly targeted the crown prince.\n\nReacting to Trump's comments, Khashoggi's widow, Hanan, told BBC Newsnight the US president's defence of the crown prince did not match up with bin Salman's own acknowledgment of responsibility for her husband's murder.\n\n\"The crown prince himself, in 2019 and 60 Minutes interview, he did take accountability about and hold responsibility about this horrible crime,\" she said.\n\nIn a post on X, she also called for a meeting with the crown prince and an apology along with compensation for her husband's murder.\n\nGranted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.\n\nTuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year.\n\nEchoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the \"hottest country on the planet\" and praised the US president for creating \"long-term opportunity\".\n\nThe two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis.\n\nTrump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could potentially hurt the country's \"qualitative military edge\" in the Middle East, where it is so far the only nation to have F-35s.\n\nThe US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate.\n\n\"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally,\" Trump said. \"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre.\n\n\"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" he added.\n\nThe crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment summit on Wednesday.\n\nPortuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league -  was also present at the dinner .\n\nBiden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights record.

The force said while it \"regretted\" that a \"grave miscarriage of justice\" had taken place, it maintained its officers acted within the law at the time.\n\nSpeaking from an undisclosed location with his face hidden to protect his privacy, Mr Sullivan, 68, said he wanted an explanation for why detectives \"picked me out\".\n\n\"I can't forgive them for what they've done to me, because it's going to be there for the rest of my life,\" he said, adding he had \"lost everything\" since going to prison.\n\n\"I've got to carry that burden until I can get an apology.\"\n\nFor decades Mr Sullivan and his family were haunted by tabloid press nicknames, including \"The Beast of Birkenhead\", \"The Mersey Ripper\", and \"The Wolfman\".\n\n\"The names, they'll always stick with me because I've never been anything like that,\" he said.\n\nMr Sullivan said despite moments of near hopelessness, he was always supported by his parents who died years before he could clear his name.\n\nHe said: \"My mum turned around to me before she died, and said, 'I want you to carry on fighting this case because you've done nothing wrong'.\"\n\nIn one of many painful moments from his time behind bars, Mr Sullivan said he was denied permission to attend his mother's funeral in 2013 because she was buried in the same cemetery as Miss Sindall.\n\nHis ordeal began after the semi-naked body of 21-year-old florist Miss Sindall was found with catastrophic injuries in an alley off Borough Road, Birkenhead, on 2 August 1986.\n\nTwo weeks later, her partially burned clothing was found on Bidston Hill, a large area of woodland about an hour's walk from the alley.\n\nAfter a BBC Crimewatch appeal was aired, witnesses came forward claiming to have seen Mr Sullivan in a pub near the murder scene that night, while others reported seeing a man fitting his description near Bidston Hill the following day.\n\nHe was arrested on suspicion of murder on 23 September 1986, and was interviewed 22 times over the following four weeks.\n\nFor the first seven police interviews, he was denied legal advice and found the experience \"very daunting\".\n\n\"They were putting stuff into my mind, then they would send me back to my cell, then I'd come back and say what they wanted, not realising what I was doing at the time,\" he said.\n\nDuring that period Mr Sullivan claimed he was beaten in his cell on two occasions by police officers.\n\n\"They threw a blanket over the top of me and they were hitting me on top of the blanket with the truncheons to try and get me to co-operate with them,\" he said.\n\n\"It really hurt, they were leathering me.\"\n\nMr Sullivan also claimed he was told if he did not confess he would be charged with \"35 other rapes\", and said he was denied food and sleep.\n\nHe was not provided with an appropriate adult to help him understand the interrogation, despite police custody records noting he had learning difficulties.\n\nAsked why he would confess to a murder he did not commit, Mr Sullivan said: \"All I can say, it was the bullying that forced me to throw my hands in, because I couldn't take it anymore.\"\n\nAppeal court documents confirm that the first time he \"confessed\" was not recorded and no solicitor was present. Other police interviews were recorded.\n\nIn a statement for this article, Merseyside Police said it was previously unaware of the allegations about beatings or threats to charge him with other offences, and said records from the time did not contain details of this. It said guidance on appropriate adults had been strengthened since 1986.\n\nThe force accepted that legal advice was initially refused for interviews, adding that officers had feared revealing some parts of the investigation to a solicitor, in case evidence was destroyed. It also said Mr Sullivan was told he did not have to speak to officers unless he wished to do so.\n\nSarah Myatt, Mr Sullivan's solicitor of more than 20 years, sat alongside him as he spoke to the BBC. \"I think, from what he's told me, he just reached breaking point with it,\" she said.\n\nMr Sullivan said during one interview he was asked to mark on a map where he had left the clothes on Bidston Hill.\n\nWhen he pointed to the wrong place, he alleges a detective replied: \"Come on Peter, you know better than that,\" before hinting at the \"correct\" location.\n\nMs Myatt said on the maps of Bidston Hill, Mr Sullivan had later written \"this is all lies\".\n\n\"I think that's quite poignant,\" she said.\n\nMerseyside Police said the maps and transcripts, which the BBC has not seen, were all served on the courts. The force said interviewing officers had been \"trying to understand the validity of his admissions\".\n\nWhile Mr Sullivan later retracted his confessions, the police and prosecution also relied on bite mark evidence, a now widely discredited field of forensic science.\n\nThat case, brought before DNA testing was widely available, was enough to convince a jury at Liverpool Crown Court - and on 5 November 1987 he went from a self-confessed \"petty thief\" to a convicted murderer.\n\nRecalling the guilty verdicts, Mr Sullivan said: \"My sister collapsed in the courtroom and the next minute, that was it.\n\n\"I was taken down from the courtroom and I just sat in that cell and cried my eyes out over the crime I hadn't done.\n\n\"I knew from then on that this is going to be one hell of a case to try and fight to try and get myself out of this situation.\"\n\nHis sentence carried a minimum term of 16 years before he was eligible to apply for parole - but Mr Sullivan maintained his innocence, lessening his chances of release.\n\nPrison was particularly difficult for someone considered a savage killer and a sex offender. \"I've been battered in prisons because of the crime I was in for,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he said reporting such violence was not an option because \"then you're a grass, and that means then you're going to get a lot worse\".\n\nThe end of his nightmare began in 2023, when the Criminal Cases Review Commission - the body set up to check for miscarriages of justice - ordered fresh testing of semen samples found on Miss Sindall's body in 1986.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to challenge the DNA results ahead of a fresh appeal - paving the way for Mr Sullivan's freedom.\n\nIn May 2025, when the appeal judgement was handed down, Mr Sullivan was listening via video-link from HMP Wakefield, sitting next to his probation officer.\n\n\"When they came back in with the verdict that my case had been quashed, [the probation officer] burst into tears first,\" he said.\n\n\"She turned around and said, 'Peter, you're going home'...\n\n\"Next minute, bang, all the tears started running down my face and that was it, I went, 'yes, justice has been done'.\"\n\nThe outside world has been a baffling place for a man who went into custody when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and the internet was unheard of.\n\nSpeaking of the moment he was driven out of prison, he said: \"I was watching the cars go by, and I've never seen so many different cars in my life on that road.\n\n\"It was daunting just seeing them all changed and everything.\"\n\nSince his release, he has sometimes found himself standing in his bedroom waiting for a prison officer to do a roll-call - a difficult habit to shake after nearly 40 years.\n\nMr Sullivan said he feels \"really sorry\" for the family of Miss Sindall, who he said are \"back at square one\" in their fight for justice.\n\n\"I've been through the same pain, being in prison, because I've been taken away from my family as well for something I haven't done,\" he said.\n\nMerseyside Police said due to the \"substantial changes\" in the law and investigative practices since 1986, there would be \"little benefit\" in any formal review of how the case was investigated.\n\nIt said it referred itself the Independent Office for Police Conduct after the appeal judgement but no misconduct was identified.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service said while the Court of Appeal accepted the new DNA testing, other grounds of appeal were rejected. Nick Price, its director of legal services, said: \"The prosecution case was brought on the basis of all the evidence available to us at the time.\"\n\nThe case of Miss Sindall's murder has been re-opened, although no arrests have been made.\n\nFor Mr Sullivan, there remains the wait for compensation, capped by the government at £1.3m for wrongful convictions.\n\nMs Myatt, who is helping him with his application, said: \"There's not a figure that you could say would be enough for losing 38 years of your life.\"\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on  BBC Sounds  and follow BBC Merseyside on  Facebook ,  X , and  Instagram , and watch BBC North West Tonight on  BBC iPlayer ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2emm4737zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:55:50.715+00:00","title":"Gustav Klimt painting becomes second most expensive artwork sold at auction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A portrait by Austrian artist Gustav Klimt, titled 'Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer,' sold for $236.4 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York, making it the second most expensive artwork ever sold at auction.

pilots of surveillance aircraft monitoring its activities, the defence secretary has said.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Downing Street, John Healey said it was the second time in a year that the Yantar had entered UK waters.\n\nThe ship is \"designed for gathering intelligence and mapping our undersea cables\", Healey told journalists.\n\n\"My message to Russia and to Putin is this: we see you. We know what you're doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready,\" he added.\n\nGiving more details on the vessel, Healey said: \"It is part of a Russian fleet designed to put and hold our undersea infrastructure and those of our allies at risk.\n\n\"It isn't just a naval operation. It's part of a Russian programme driven by what they call the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research, or GUGI, and this is designed to have capabilities which can undertake surveillance in peacetime and sabotage in conflict.\n\n\"That is why we've been determined, whenever the Yantar comes into British wider waters, we track it, we deter it and we say to Putin we are ready, and we do that alongside allies.\"\n\nHe said this was a demonstration of Britain's capability and \"readiness to act\".\n\nThe defence secretary  issued a warning in January  about the ship after it was spotted in UK waters.\n\nAt his Downing Street press conference, he said this was the first time Yantar had used lasers in an effort to \"disrupt\" RAF pilots, which he described as a \"deeply dangerous\" and something the UK took \"very seriously\".\n\nHe said he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely \"when it's in our wider waters\".\n\n\"We have military options ready should the Yantar change course. I am not going to reveal those because that only makes President Putin wiser,\" he said.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence has come under  criticism from a committee of MPs  for being over-reliant on US defence resources and not being prepared to defend the UK and its overseas territories from military attack.\n\nThe committee said the UK and its European allies should be building up their capabilities to prepare for potential US withdrawal.\n\nHealey said the UK government \"takes a different view\" to the committee about America's commitment to Nato.\n\n\"The strength of Nato is not just about the defence of Europe. it's about the defence of America too,\" he told reporters.\n\nBut he said the committee was \"right to say\" Britain should \"pick up the pace of our commitment\" and that was something Labour has been doing since it came to power last year.\n\nThe report comes as British negotiators race to agree a deal with the EU to enable British defence companies to contribute to projects funded by a new €150bn (£130bn) EU defence loan scheme  set to launch next year .\n\nThe Labour government wants to conclude a deal in the coming weeks to allow British companies to take part in the first round of bids from EU countries, with applications due by the end of this month.\n\nHealey told reporters the UK wanted to be part of the programme, but not \"at any price\", amid reports the two sides are at odds over the entry fee the UK could pay to enable British firms to take part.\n\nHe added that any financial contribution to take part would have to be \"good value for money for our taxpayers and our industry\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ey0nl62ypo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"04:41:37.110+00:00","title":"White House has apologised over Georgia raid, says Hyundai boss","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House apologised to Hyundai CEO José Muñoz for a large-scale immigration raid on a battery plant in Georgia, which detained over 300 South Korean workers in September.

He described the case in July as \"pretty boring stuff\".\n\nThat was until Sunday, when - with a snowballing number of Republicans in the House signalling they would vote to release them - the president relented and encouraged them to do so. His shift opened the floodgates for an overwhelming 427-1 vote on Tuesday.\n\nHis reversal was a rare instance of Republican politicians pressuring Trump into action, and into a very public change in stance, rather than the other way around.\n\nRegardless of what new information any future files may contain, the saga exposed fractures within the Republican Party and highlighted the power of Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) base.\n\nIt also has shown that, despite his best efforts, he may have struggled to move attention away from the Epstein files if he had not backed the vote.\n\n\"I think he sees that this is an issue he's underwater in with average Republicans,\" said Martha Zoller, a conservative radio host and Republican strategist in Georgia.\n\n\"I think Trump had to do this in this point in time because he wants to be back on the right side,\" she added.\n\nA NPR/PBS News/Marist poll taken at the end of September - when Trump was yet to back the release of the files - suggested that 67% of Republican registered voters supported the release of all Epstein files with victims' names redacted. Another 18% supported releasing some of the files with similar redactions.\n\n\"Transparency on what happened is extremely important to the voters,\" Chris Ager, the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party, told the BBC.\n\nHe praised Trump's reversal, arguing it was the sign of a healthy party \"that you can have a disagreement on an issue... and come to a conclusion where essentially everyone is agreeing: Let's release the files\".\n\nFor much of this year, however, there were sharp disagreements on the issue. Trump's reversal came as it looked increasingly likely he could face a revolt in the House.\n\nThe most notable defector, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, said at a press conference with Epstein survivors on Tuesday that the saga had \"ripped Maga apart\".\n\nDue to her vocal opposition, Trump dubbed her a \"traitor\" on Truth Social. Typically, such a public attack from the president would quiet dissent from a Republican, especially one up for re-election. But in a sign of the political potency of the Epstein issue, Greene pushed back.\n\n\"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off this discharge petition,\" Greene said on Tuesday.\n\nThe House would advance the legislation, Greene said, \"because the American people who we serve as representatives here in Congress demanded this vote happen\".\n\nGreene, who first broke with Trump in the spring, has been the public face of building dissent within Trump's Maga movement - not just on Epstein, but on other issues such as the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites in June and the president's continuing focus on foreign wars.\n\nBut on the Epstein issue in particular, Greene and others in the movement have called for greater transparency despite Trump's desire to focus on other issues. And after Tuesday's votes in Congress, they can claim real success.\n\n\"The saga reveals how much power the Republican base now wields,\" party strategist Rina Shah told NPR in the summer. \"MAGA voters are furious.\"\n\n\"This pressure is forcing even the most loyal Trump allies to break ranks. And it signals a Republican Party that's increasingly populist, where the grassroots can push leaders to act or they have to pay a price.\"\n\nThe Epstein vote has also overshadowed other White House initiatives. Last week,  President Trump announced he would roll back tariffs on groceries  like coffee, bananas and beef as Americans' cost of living concerns increased.\n\n\"I think he'd rather people talk about those things than Epstein,\" Zoller, the Republican strategist in Georgia, said.\n\nOne senior Trump administration official told Axios  that the president decided to drop his opposition to the legislation because the noise around the Epstein issue was proving to be a \"major distraction\".\n\nGreene herself has said the White House was going down the wrong track by resisting the release of more Epstein files, instead of focusing on other issues.\n\n\"It's insanely the wrong direction to go,\" Greene  told POLITICO . \"The five-alarm fire is healthcare and affordability for Americans. And that's where the focus should be.\"\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, said in a statement to the BBC that \"by releasing thousands of pages of documents, co-operating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\"\n\nEven beyond Epstein, Trump's influence on the party has been tested - and even rebuffed this week. And there are signs of potential rifts, too.\n\nHis public efforts to encourage Indiana's leaders to redraw their congressional maps to favour Republicans before the 2026 midterm elections hit a potentially critical roadblock on the same day as the Epstein vote.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Indiana Senate voted on Tuesday to adjourn until January, signalling it would not take up the issue of redistricting. That is despite major pressure from the president as well as the state's Republican governor who has asked lawmakers to work on redrawing maps.\n\nTrump has even threatened to back primary challenges to senators who oppose redistricting. But as with the Epstein issue, there has been defiance within the party.\n\n\"I've been a legislator 42 years. I'm not going to change my vote,\" Republican Senator Vaneta Becker told CNN.\n\nReferring to the nickname for people from Indiana, she said: \"Hoosiers are not used to being sort of in a blackmail position. It does not bode well.\"\n\nBut as those close to Trump have noted, he has navigated fallouts and internal opposition in the past. Despite this defiance on several fronts, the president remains the most powerful figure in the party.\n\n\"I think the president is going to be praised for the fact that the information gets released and is out. At the end of the day, it's results, not the sausage making that got us there,\" said Mr Ager, referring to the Epstein files.\n\nTrump said as much himself in a Truth Social posted Tuesday night, remarking that he did not care when Senate Republicans passed the bill. “I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmxgymr8ewo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"09:20:11.036+00:00","title":"Two Miss Universe judges quit scandal-hit pageant, as one claims it's rigged","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two high-profile individuals, Lebanese-French musician Omar Harfouch and French football manager Claude Makélélé, resigned from the Miss Universe jury days before the pageant, citing allegations of a rigged selection process and lack of transparency.

\"impromptu jury\" had pre-selected finalists ahead of the competition, set to be held on Friday in Thailand.\n\nHours later, French football manager Claude Makélélé also announced he'd pulled out, citing \"unforeseen personal reasons\".\n\nThe resignations come two weeks after several Miss Universe  contestants walked out  of a pre-pageant event over controversial comments made by an official from host nation Thailand.\n\n\"An impromptu jury has been formed to select 30 finalists from among the 136 participating countries, without the presence of any of the real [eight] members of the jury, including me,\" Mr Harfouch wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday, saying he had discovered this via social media.\n\nThe unofficial jury comprises \"individuals with a significant potential conflict of interest due to some personal relationships with some of the Miss Universe contestants\", he claimed.\n\nMr Harfouch did not elaborate on how this \"impromptu jury\" would function, or how it would override the official jury's decision.\n\nThe Miss Universe Organisation on Tuesday put out a statement to rebuff Mr Harfouch's claims, saying that \"no external group has been authorised to evaluate delegates or select finalists\".\n\nIt suggested that   Mr Harfouch may have been referring to the Beyond the Crown programme: a \"social impact initiative\" that operates independently from the Miss Universe competition, and has a separate selection committee.\n\nThe Miss Universe Organisation announced the Beyond the Crown selection committee on Monday. In its statement on Tuesday, the organisation said that Mr Harfouch's allegations had \"mischaracterised\" the programme.\n\nMr Makélélé, who also announced his resignation via Instagram, described it as a \"difficult decision\".\n\n\"I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard. The platform represents empowerment, diversity, and excellence - values I have always championed throughout my career,\" he wrote.\n\nThe beauty pageant drew backlash earlier this month after its Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil publicly berated Miss Mexico, Fatima Bosch, at a pre-pageant event for not posting promotional content on her social media platforms.\n\nIn videos that have since gone viral, Ms Bosch and several other contestants could be seen walking out of the event, and some could be heard shouting at Mr Nawat.\n\nMr Nawat later claimed that some of his words were misunderstood - but his conduct nevertheless prompted a stern rebuke from the Miss Universe Organisation, which has since sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l73j781y9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"22:19:58.732+00:00","title":"Lebanon says Israeli strike killed 13 people near Palestinian refugee camp","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Israeli airstrike near the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon killed at least 13 people and injured four, with Israel claiming the site was a Hamas training compound used for planning attacks on Israel.

years, say scientists \n\nHumans do it, monkeys do it, even polar bears do it. And now researchers have reconstructed the evolutionary origins of kissing.\n\nTheir study suggests that the mouth-on-mouth kiss evolved more than 21 million years ago, and was something that the common ancestor of humans and other great apes probably indulged in.\n\nThe same research concluded that Neanderthals may have kissed too – and that humans and Neanderthals may even have smooched one another.\n\nThe scientists studied kissing because it presents something of an evolutionary puzzle - it has no obvious survival or reproductive benefits, and yet it is something that is seen not just in many human societies, but across the animal kingdom.\n\nBy finding evidence of other animals engaging in kissing, scientists were able to construct an \"evolutionary family tree\" to work out when it was most likely to have evolved.\n\nTo ensure that they were comparing the same behaviour across different species, the researchers had to give a very precise - rather unromantic - definition to a \"kiss\".\n\nIn their study,  published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour , they defined kissing as non aggressive, directed oral-oral contact \"with some movement of lips or mouthparts and no food transfer\".\n\n\"Humans, chimps, and bonobos all kiss,\" explained lead researcher Dr Matilda Brindle, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Oxford. From that, she concluded, \"it's likely that their most recent common ancestor kissed.\"\n\n\"We think kissing probably evolved around 21.5 million years ago in the large apes.\"\n\nIn this study, scientists found behaviour that matched their scientific definition of kissing in wolves, prairie dogs, polar bears (very sloppy - lots of tongue), and even albatrosses.\n\nThey focused on primates - and apes in particular - in order to build an evolutionary picture of the origin of the human kiss.\n\nThe same study also concluded that Neanderthals - our closest ancient human relatives that died out around 40,000 years ago - also kissed.\n\nOne previous  piece of research on Neanderthal DNA  also showed that modern humans and Neanderthals shared an oral microbe - a type of bacteria found in our saliva.\n\n\"That means that they must have been swapping saliva for hundreds of thousands of years after the two species split,\" explained Dr Brindle.\n\nWhile this study pinpointed when kissing evolved it was not able to answer the question of why.\n\nThere are already a number of theories - that it  arose from grooming behaviour  in our ape ancestors or that it might provide an intimate way to  assess the health and even the compatibility  of a partner.\n\nDr Brindle hopes that this will open a door to answering that question.\n\n\"It's important for us to understand that this is something we share with our non-human relatives,\" she said.\n\n\"We should be studying this behaviour, not just dismissing it as silly because it has romantic connotations in humans.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p8dpw1rwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"04:05:03.705+00:00","title":"Ethiopia's Amhara conflict: The forgotten war destroying women's lives","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the ongoing sexual violence committed by the Ethiopian army in the Amhara region since August 2023, in response to a rebellion by local Fano militias.

This report contains descriptions of rape and sexual violence. Names of victims have been changed and identifying details omitted to protect their privacy and safety.\n\nEnat was at home with her eight-year-old niece when the soldiers came one Sunday morning, she says.\n\nThe Ethiopian army was carrying out searches of homes in the Amhara region on 5 January this year, as part of a crackdown on a growing rebellion launched by local militias known as Fano.\n\nEnat says three men, dressed in army uniform, entered her home in South Gondar and began asking questions about her family background and whether Fano fighters had visited the beer hall where she worked.\n\nEnat, 21, said they had.\n\n\"How could we lie? How can we hide the truth?\" Enat says, noting that Fano - an Amharic word loosely translated as volunteer fighters - is made up of locals.\n\nThings quickly escalated.\n\nAfter asking questions about her family background, Enat says the soldiers began insulting her, then threatened her niece with a gun when the little girl started crying.\n\nEnat says one of the soldiers then raped her in front of her niece while the others kept guard.\n\n\"I begged them not to hurt me. I called on the saints and begged them. But their hearts didn't pity me. They violated me.\"\n\nEnat, who is from the Amhara ethnic group, the second largest in Ethiopia, is among thousands of women believed to have been sexually assaulted and raped since the conflict between the Ethiopian army and Fano started in August 2023.\n\nSexual violence in the region is largely undocumented, but the BBC has collated data which shows there have been thousands of reports of rape between July 2023 and May 2025, with victims as young as eight and as old as 65.\n\nWhile restrictions have prevented independent media from entering Amhara to cover the conflict, the BBC team in Nairobi, in neighbouring Kenya, managed to speak to women and doctors in the region, offering a rare insight into the human impact of the crisis.\n\nThe conflict began when the government attempted to disband regional military groups, including those in Amhara, which had fought with the army during the 2020-2022 civil war in the next-door region of Tigray.\n\nFano militias felt betrayed by the move and believed it would leave them vulnerable to attack from Tigray and elsewhere, especially as violence against the Amhara community had intensified, according to rights groups.\n\nIn response, Fano launched a rebellion, seizing major towns. They claim to be fighting for regional autonomy and protecting their communities from marginalisation by the Ethiopian government.\n\nThe insurgency has resulted in a violent crackdown by the army, which calls Fano \"radical ethno-nationalists\".\n\nSince the conflict started, both sides have been accused of numerous human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, forced displacement, destruction of property, looting and widespread cases of sexual violence, including rape.\n\nRights groups, including Amnesty International, say there is evidence the army is disproportionately responsible for the abuses. They also say that Amhara people in other parts of Ethiopia have been deliberately targeted by the security forces and other armed groups.\n\nBefore she was attacked, Enat had never had sex and planned to one day marry at her local church in a ceremony conducted in accordance with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church's rites, just as other women in her family had done.\n\nSuch marriages are among the most revered traditions of the Amhara people, who are predominantly Orthodox Christian, but it requires couples to remain \"pure\" and not have any sexual contact until marriage.\n\n\"Before that day, I had never known a man,\" she says.\n\n\"It would have been better if they had killed me.\"\n\nTigist, 18, from West Gojjam, also in the Amhara region, worked in her family's small, traditional teahouse before she was attacked.\n\nShe describes how, in January 2024, a soldier who was a regular customer groped her. She says she rejected him - an act she believes led to the attack.\n\nLater that evening, as she was returning home from work, she says three soldiers, including the man who groped her, ambushed her in the street and gang-raped her on the pavement.\n\n\"My family found me unconscious on the roadside,\" she recalls. \"They carried me to the clinic, where I spent five days.\"\n\nSince the attack, Tigist says she's been unable to leave her house, paralysed by fear of men and the outside world.\n\n\"My fear keeps me from going to work... Whenever I see soldiers or any men I panic and hide myself away.\"\n\nShe ended up retreating from her life and breaking off her engagement. She says she never told her fiance why or what happened.\n\nOverwhelmed by despair, Tigist attempted to take her own life, but her family intervened just in time and saved her. She says that although she has contemplated suicide since then, she has promised her family she will not try to kill herself again.\n\nThe BBC collected data from 43 health facilities in Amhara - roughly 4% of all health facilities in the region - and other medical sources to get a snapshot of what has been happening.\n\nAt these facilities, there were 2,697 reports of rape between 18 July 2023 and May 2025. Children under 18 accounted for 45% of cases.\n\nJust over half of the victims tested positive for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), while many were also left pregnant and with severe psychological trauma.\n\nHowever, many victims of sexual violence never report the crime or seek treatment, fearful of stigma or of learning they may have contracted an STI or become pregnant.\n\nFor this reason, a senior health expert, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, says the victims who come to facilities in the Amhara region are only \"the tip of the iceberg\".\n\nLemlem is among those who have never reported their rape or sought medical treatment, terrified of learning that she might have a sexually transmitted infection, such as HIV.\n\nThe 23-year-old from South Gondar says government soldiers entered her house on 6 January to ask for information, a routine army practice.\n\nShe says when she didn't give them what they wanted, one of the soldiers raped her.\n\n\"He threatened me, saying: 'If you scream, one bullet is enough for you,'\" Lemlem says.\n\n\"I wept non-stop for a whole month. I couldn't eat. All I did was cry. I couldn't stand to walk. And I fell gravely ill.\"\n\nShe says the assault has driven her away from church, where she fears she may be the subject of gossip.\n\n\"It's repulsive to have been born a woman. If I were a man, they might have beaten me and walked away - they wouldn't have destroyed my life like this,\" says Lemlem, explaining how the trauma of the attack has made her feel about being female.\n\nMedics the BBC spoke to say there has been a sharp rise in the number of victims of sexual violence that they have been treating since the conflict began.\n\n\"They arrive trembling, too intimidated even to speak,\" one medic says.\n\nYet those who do come forward are reluctant to name their attackers and rarely seek justice, in part because the conflict has led to a breakdown in law and order.  Instead, most who do seek medical assistance come out of fear of pregnancy.\n\nOthers seek treatment long after they have been attacked, by which point certain medications for the STIs they have contracted, such as HIV, are no longer effective.\n\nHIV can often be prevented with a treatment called post-exposure prophylaxis, but only if it is administered soon after sex with someone who was infected.\n\nAnother medic notes that many victims say they are unable to access treatment promptly due to transport disruption and road blockages caused by the conflict.\n\nA senior medic warns they fear a public health and social crisis could be looming.\n\nBased on information health centres have gathered, they say that they \"have identified signs that HIV infections may rise and that mental health and psychological problems could reach catastrophic levels\", noting that some victims have attempted suicide.\n\nFigures from Ethiopia's health ministry in 2022 showed that the HIV rate in the region was around 1.1 per 100 people - higher than the national average.\n\nWhile assaults have been carried out by both sides in the conflict, medical staff report seeing more cases involving Ethiopian army soldiers than Fano militia. A government employee with access to relevant information, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, also said this was the case.\n\nMost incidents of rape were reported in urban areas where the army maintains bases and exerts control, however experts point out that people living in cities have better access to treatment so are more likely to get help and report attacks.\n\nThe BBC was unable to interview any victims of assaults by Fano fighters due to limited access to places where the militia are based.\n\nIn June 2024, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that the Ethiopian National Defence Force, which includes the army, had perpetrated sexual violence, including against minors, in the Amhara region during the conflict with Fano militia.\n\nThe BBC asked Ethiopia's ministry of defence to respond to allegations, but despite months of waiting, we have not received a reply.\n\nRepeated BBC requests for detailed information from regional authorities were also unsuccessful.\n\nA Fano leader, Asres Mare Damtie, told the BBC the group was unaware of any involvement by its fighters, saying no accusations had been made against them and it enforces severe punishment, including death, for offenders.\n\nThe BBC has learned that a government-commissioned investigation led by Ethiopia's Bahir Dar University into conflict-related sexual violence against women in Amhara has begun, with findings expected to be released publicly in the coming months.\n\nIn 2021, when the army and its allies - which then included Fano - faced similar allegations over their conduct in the Tigray conflict, the government condemned the use of rape but dismissed the claims as \"biased and flawed\".\n\nTo date, no official action has been publicly disclosed against perpetrators.\n\nAmnesty International has raised concerns over what it believes is a persistent pattern of impunity in Ethiopia's army. \"There is no meaningful effort to bring perpetrators into justice,\" says the organisation's regional researcher, Haimanot Ashenafi.\n\n\"They're still fighting, they are still out there with no consequences for what they've done… survivors who have gone through this life-changing experience deserve justice.\"\n\nFor Enat, the consequences of her attack have been far-reaching.\n\nA month after the assault, she fled her village to escape the trauma of the attack.\n\nIt was then she learned she was pregnant as a result of the rape.\n\n\"I started vomiting,\" she recalls.\n\nShe thought of having an abortion, which is legally permitted in Ethiopia up to 12 weeks into pregnancy if a woman is raped, but she was scared.\n\n\"I feared God, and I felt for my mother. What would become of her if I died during the abortion?\"\n\nShe gave birth to a daughter in early September after three days of labour.\n\nDespite what happened to her, Enat considers the baby a \"gift from God\".\n\nBut she is currently living with a relative and is unable to work as she has to look after her daughter. She worries for the future and how she will provide for her child and herself.\n\n\"If this is what is considered to be living, then yes, I am living,\" she adds.\n\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by the issues raised in this story, details of organisations offering information and support are available at  BBC ActionLine ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0yere4k0zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"11:25:12.991+00:00","title":"Russian attack on Ternopil kills 20 in one of deadliest strikes on western Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a severe escalation of the war, Russian forces launched a deadly drone and missile attack on Ternopil, western Ukraine, killing at least 20 people — including two children — and injuring 66 others, with one block of flats completely collapsing.

including two children in a Russian drone and missile attack on the western city of Ternopil that hit two blocks of flats, Ukrainian officials say.\n\nAnother 66 people were wounded, 16 of them children, police said, in one of the deadliest Russian strikes on western Ukraine since the full-scale war began in February 2022.\n\nTwo other western regions were hit, Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk, and a drone attack targeted three districts of the northern city of Kharkiv, wounding more than 30 people. Photos posted online showed buildings and cars ablaze.\n\nPower cuts were affecting a number of regions across the country, Ukraine's energy ministry said.\n\nUkraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had fired more than 470 drones and 47 missiles, leaving \"significant destruction\". He warned that people could be trapped under the rubble in Ternopil.\n\nThe devastation caused by the Russian strikes on Ternopil soon became clear. A video shared by Zelensky showed that one of the two blocks of flats had completely caved in. The interior minister Ihor Klymenko said it had been destroyed between the third and the ninth floor.\n\nPlumes of smoke poured from windows and small fires burned outside the tenement.\n\nA giant smoke cloud rose in the distance behind the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Ternopil, as sirens blared throughout the city.\n\nEnergy facilities, transport and civil infrastructure were damaged elsewhere in western Ukraine.\n\nThe energy sector came under attack in Ivano-Frankivsk region where two of three people reported wounded were children.\n\nThe head of Lviv region said an energy facility had been struck.\n\nThe Russian strikes came a day after Ukraine's military said it had fired US-supplied longer-range Atacms missiles at military targets inside Russia, the first time they have admitted using the Atacms on Russian soil.\n\nRussia's defence ministry accused Ukraine of firing four of the missiles at the southern city of Voronezh but said they had all been shot down by air defences.\n\nMeanwhile, Zelensky is heading to the Turkish capital Ankara, in an attempt to revive a US bid to end the war. He will hold talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid reports that President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff has been working on a plan with Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev.\n\nThe Kremlin said no Russian representative would be joining the talks in Ankara.

Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Army Chief of Staff General Randy George are the most senior US military officials to visit the Ukrainian capital since President Donald Trump took office, Reuters reports.\n\nIn a separate development, Romania's defence ministry said a Russian drone had flown for about 8km (5 miles) through its airspace in the early hours of Wednesday. The drone then crossed into Ukraine and Moldova before returning to Romania, it said.\n\nRomanian and German air force planes were scrambled in response to the incursion and the defence ministry said it was unclear where the drone had come down.\n\nPoland also deployed jets early on Wednesday and temporarily closed two airports in the southeast in response to the strikes in western Ukraine.\n\nAs the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches next February, Moscow and Kyiv remain fundamentally opposed in their views of how to end the war.\n\nEarlier this month Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia's conditions for a peace deal had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/trump-saudi-crown-prince-visit.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:25:07-05:00","title":"Trump Lauds Saudi Prince in Lavish Visit, Brushing Off Journalist’s Killing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a lavish visit to the White House, President Donald Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, praising him as a close friend and business partner while dismissing allegations that the crown prince ordered the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

And in a remarkable Oval Office outburst, Mr. Trump defended him against a U.S. intelligence report that he had ordered the murder of a journalist.\n\nIt was a chummy scene that underscored the president’s desire to maintain strong relations with Saudi Arabia during a tumultuous period in the Middle East. Mr. Trump’s defense of his guest obscured the crown prince’s role in cracking down on domestic dissent and in the killing and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, in 2018.\n\n“We’ve been really good friends for a long period of time,” Mr. Trump told reporters, cabinet officials and members of the Saudi delegation who had gathered there. “We’ve always been on the same side of every issue.”\n\nThe 42-minute appearance contained plenty of talk about business deals and diplomatic partnerships, as well as a presidential fit over pointed questions from reporters that was striking even for Mr. Trump, who is no stranger to televised dramatics. As he berated a reporter for asking about Mr. Khashoggi’s murder and about people who have accused the Saudi government of supporting the hijackers behind the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Trump brushed off the killing, appearing even more agitated about the question than his guest of honor.\n\n“A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Mr. Khashoggi. Mr. Trump defended the crown prince, who sat next to him, looking down and inspecting his hands: “Whether you like him, or didn’t like him, things happen. But he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that. You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.”\n\nThroughout their joint appearance, Mr. Trump seemed more interested in producing a smooth, lavish visit that could pave the way for up to $1 trillion of Saudi investment into the United States than the implications of the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies. During the Biden administration, U.S. intelligence officials released a report that determined that the crown prince had ordered Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, but declined to take direction against the crown prince. Prince Mohammed has denied his involvement.\n\nSimilarly, during his first term, Mr. Trump had defended President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who denied to Mr. Trump that his government had any involvement in meddling in the 2016 election, despite the findings of the U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n“I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia,” Mr. Trump said at the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump heaped praise and state-dinner-style honors upon the crown prince, whom he has long treated like a business partner instead of a pariah. When his guest arrived at the southern entrance of the White House, military officers on horseback trotted across the drive, flying Saudi and American flags. The treatment was more ostentatious than most visiting dignitaries receive, even for state visits.\n\nAdding to the ceremony was a military band, and a flyover that included several F-35 fighter jets. Mr. Trump said on Monday that he intended to sell the advanced aircraft to the Saudis, a decision that would need congressional approval. Other agreements came together, including one on artificial intelligence, a mutual defense pact and an agreement that would eventually offer Saudi Arabia access to the United States’ nuclear technology.\n\nThe crown prince was set to be honored Tuesday night at a welcome ceremony and a black-tie dinner at the White House attended by major business leaders, including the billionaire and former Trump adviser Elon Musk. On Wednesday, he is scheduled to participate with the president in an investment conference at Washington’s Kennedy Center.\n\nAhead of the visit, Mr. Trump had hinted that he wanted the Saudis to agree to normalize relations with Israel and sign onto the Abraham Accords, a set of diplomatic agreements that normalized relations between Israel and three Arab states during the first Trump administration.\n\nBut it was clear that was not on the table for this visit. “Israel will be very happy,” Mr. Trump insisted, when pressed about failing to secure Saudi Arabia’s commitment on that front. “Israel is aware, and they’re going to be very happy.”\n\nTo fulfill the rest of his 20-point plan to rebuild Gaza and his desire to increase participation in the Abraham Accords, Mr. Trump will need to keep the Saudis engaged, analysts said.\n\n“Part of his incentive is to wine and dine the Saudi leadership and lay the groundwork for that eventuality of normalizing with Israel,” said Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Quincy Institute, a foreign policy think tank. But, he added, “from the Saudi point of view, they’re getting a lot of the package that had been put forward, without normalizing.”\n\nOn Tuesday, all of those details seemed secondary to Mr. Trump’s interest in showing off the White House, which he is remodeling in his image.\n\nAt one point, Mr. Trump stopped to show the prince a wall of presidential portraits, including the photo of an autopen hanging in the space where the portrait of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would be. And the president made clear he was not interested in giving any credit to a predecessor whose administration had opted to preserve the strategic relationship between the two countries rather than take direct action against the crown prince for Mr. Khashoggi’s murder.\n\n“Trump doesn’t give a fist bump,” Mr. Trump said, referring to himself, and also to the greeting between Mr. Biden and the crown prince in 2022. He gestured to the crown prince: “I grabbed that hand. I don’t give a hell where that hand’s been. I grabbed that.”\n\nMr. Trump also seemed eager to establish his friendship with the crown prince.\n\n“I can call him almost any time,” Mr. Trump said. “When you love your job, when you love your country, and when you’re in a position like we are — future king, highly respected crown prince, and in my case, president, you’re thinking about your country.”\n\nThe Trump family business has also reaped the benefits of closely working with Saudi Arabia. This week, the Trump Organization and its Saudi-based development partner, Dar Al Arkan, announced a new project allowing cryptocurrency investors to buy into Trump-branded real estate projects using digital tokens that can be bought and sold on a blockchain platform. Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has been helping with the Middle East peace process, runs a private equity firm that has taken $2 billion from a fund led by the crown prince.\n\nMr. Kushner was not expected to attend the dinner, but Mr. Trump’s son, Don Jr., was expected to attend, according to a White House official familiar with the guest list.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, when the crown prince left the White House, some members of the Saudi delegation carried red gift bags with the president’s signature embossed on them, which they loaded into a waiting vehicle before departing.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/trump-saudi-dinner-guests.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:26:48-05:00","title":"Who Is Attending Trump’s Dinner for the Saudi Crown Prince?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is hosting a black-tie dinner at the White House for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, marking a significant diplomatic reset after the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi.

One of the world’s most famous soccer players. The president of soccer’s governing body. Dozens of executives from the finance, tech and energy sectors.\n\nThese are some of the guests expected to attend President Trump’s black-tie dinner for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia at the White House Tuesday evening.\n\nThe red carpet welcome for Prince Mohammed is an extraordinary moment in diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. It is his first visit to the United States since the 2018 killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, which U.S. intelligence determined the prince ordered. Prince Mohammed has denied involvement.\n\nAfter Mr. Khashoggi’s murder, some Western business executives and government officials backed out of Saudi Arabia’s global investment conference, including leaders of major American financial institutions. But by the following year, top deal makers were back at the event in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump and the crown prince cast their partnership as one that would reap benefits for both countries. Already, Mr. Trump has agreed to sell F-35 fighter jets to the kingdom, and the prince has promised to invest some $600 billion in the United States.\n\nThe White House is planning to release a full guest list, according to an official. Here is a list of some of the guests expected at the dinner:\n\nMr. Ronaldo, 40, is one of the most famous soccer players in the world, and has won multiple accolades throughout a professional career that began in 2002.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Mr. Ronaldo, a Portuguese national who has played in leagues in England, Spain and Italy, is currently plying his trade with the club team Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League. The Saudi government has invested billions of dollars over the years to attract world-class players, and Mr. Ronaldo is the league’s highest-paid player.\n\n— Minho Kim and Ryan Mac\n\nMr. Infantino is the head of FIFA, international soccer’s governing body, and has served in the role for nearly 10 years. He has grown close to Mr. Trump as the United States prepares to co-host the World Cup in 2026.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Mr. Infantino is also close to Prince Mohammed, and helped award Saudi Arabia the World Cup in 2034. FIFA’s president openly campaigned for the Saudi World Cup bid, pushed for Saudi investment in the sport and created rules for World Cup hosts that all but ensured that the Gulf State would get to hold the event.\n\n— Ryan Mac\n\nMr. Musk, the world’s richest man, is making his first visit to the White House since he left his role in the administration in dramatic fashion, lashing out at Mr. Trump. The two have reached something of a détente in recent months.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Mr. Musk has had a frosty relationship with Saudi leaders that has thawed in recent months. For years, the billionaire has blamed the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, for pulling out of his failed effort to take Tesla private, and has criticized the state’s position on “journalistic freedom of speech.” But Mr. Musk has also accepted Saudi investment in X, his social media site, and xAI, his artificial intelligence company. Humain, a state-backed A.I. company in Saudi Arabia, has hinted it would do deals with xAI.\n\n— Theodore Schleifer and Ryan Mac\n\nDavid Ellison is the chief executive of Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, MTV and Hollywood’s oldest movie studio.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Mr. Ellison is trying to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in what would be a major multibillion dollar media deal. Mr. Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, is backing those efforts, but the Saudi sovereign wealth fund could be part of the deal.\n\n— Lauren Hirsch\n\nMr. Wirth is the chief executive of Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Chevron has extensive business ties with Saudi Arabia, where one of its corporate ancestors, Standard Oil of California, began exploring for crude oil nearly a century ago. Chevron now produces oil and natural gas on the kingdom’s behalf in the neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Such partnerships between U.S. oil companies and foreign governments or state-owned energy companies are quite common. Chevron, which said it has “a long history of productive cooperation in the kingdom,” also has financial interests in chemicals plants there, and buys Saudi oil.\n\n— Rebecca F. Elliott\n\nMr. Schwarzman is the chief executive and co-founder of Blackstone, a large New York-based private equity firm.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Blackstone, which manages $1.25 trillion in assets, has been doing business with Saudi Arabia for many years. During Mr. Trump’s first state visit to the kingdom in 2017, Blackstone announced that the sovereign wealth fund would make an investment of up to $20 billion for a project Blackstone was launching to invest in U.S. infrastructure. Over the years, Mr. Schwarzman has traveled frequently to Riyadh to meet with his Saudi investors and to participate in the kingdom’s annual investment conference. More recently, a Blackstone-backed company called Air Trunk announced plans to help build data centers in Saudi Arabia.\n\n— Kate Kelly\n\nMs. Barra is the chief executive of General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia is the largest car market in the Middle East. G.M. sells Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac vehicles in a market dominated by Japanese, Korean and, increasingly, Chinese brands. Her presence may also reflect a desire to maintain good relations with Mr. Trump. His tariffs on imported cars and parts have cost G.M. and other carmakers billions of dollars in profits.\n\n— Jack Ewing\n\nMr. Ford is the executive chairman of Ford Motor.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Ford recently revamped its management team in Saudi Arabia and has reported brisk growth in the Middle East’s largest car market. But Mr. Ford is probably most interested in maintaining good relations with Mr. Trump, whose tariffs and other policies have had a significant impact on Ford’s business.\n\n— Jack Ewing\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is Mr. Trump’s oldest son, and helps lead the family business, the Trump Organization, with Eric Trump, his younger brother.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Mr. Trump served as a liaison to Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia, for his father’s presidential campaign in 2016. After Mr. Khashoggi’s murder in 2018, he also spread an unsubstantiated claim that Mr. Khashoggi had been a terrorist sympathizer. The Trump Organization has a long history of business dealings with Saudi Arabia, ranging from real estate deals in the Middle East to hosting Saudi-backed golf tournaments at Trump properties. Since Mr. Trump’s return to the White House, his sons have also secured a flurry of new real estate deals, including three new developments in Saudi Arabia. More talks are ongoing.\n\n— Minho Kim and Adam Sella\n\nMs. Powell McCormick is the head of global client services at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank and investment firm, and served as a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Trump in his first term. She is married to Senator Dave McCormick, Republican of Pennsylvania and a former money management executive at Bridgewater Associates.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Both Ms. Powell McCormick and Mr. McCormick have served in Republican White Houses. As a partner at Goldman Sachs, Ms. Powell McCormick oversaw relationships with sovereign wealth funds, including Saudi Arabia’s. She also sits on the executive committee of the Future Investment Initiative Institute, the group that sponsors Saudi Arabia’s annual deal-making conference in Riyadh.\n\n— Kate Kelly and Lauren Hirsch\n\nRyan Mac, Kate Kelly, Lauren Hirsch, Jack Ewing, Katie Rogers, Rebecca Elliott, Minho Kim, Adam Sella and Theodore Schleifer contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/19/climate/home-insurance-premiums-costs-usa.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"00:02:01-05:00","title":"America’s Home Insurance Affordability Crunch: See What’s Happening Near You","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rising home insurance costs—driven primarily by climate-related disasters, reinsurance market changes, and rebuilding expenses—are significantly impacting homeownership affordability in the U.S., particularly in regions prone to hurricanes, wildfires, and hail.

Affordability Crunch: See What’s Happening Near You.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-19T00:02:01-05:00\n\nInsurance premiums are rising fast in the parts of the United States most exposed to climate-related disasters like wildfires and hurricanes.\n\nNew research shows that, as insurance has sharply pushed up the cost of owning a home, the price shock is starting to reverberate through the broader real estate market.\n\nNote: “High end” refers to the top decile of homeowner payments in each county. The 2023 values are shown for Vermont because of discrepancies in the source data.\n\nIn some areas of the country that are exposed to disasters, homes are not selling because prospective buyers can’t afford both the mortgage and the insurance.\n\nIn parts of the hail-prone Midwestern states, insurance now eats up more than one-fifth of the average homeowner’s total housing payments, including mortgage costs and property taxes. In Orleans Parish, La., that number is nearly 30 percent.\n\nSource: Keys and Mulder (National Bureau of Economic Research, 2025)\n\nNote: The 2023 values are shown for Vermont because of discrepancies in the source data.\n\nNationally, insurance rates have risen by an average of 58 percent since 2018, outpacing inflation by a substantial margin. But that growth has been highly uneven across the United States.\n\nSource: Keys and Mulder (National Bureau of Economic Research, 2025)\n\nNote: “High end” refers to the top decile of homeowner payments in each county. The 2023 values are shown for Vermont because of discrepancies in the source data.\n\nPlaces that are most vulnerable to climate-related disasters like hurricanes, fires and hail are seeing some of the largest premium increases. It’s not always the case that the highest climate risk translates into the highest insurance costs. Local policies and regulations have helped keep prices lower in high-risk places, like parts of California. Other factors, like a homeowner’s credit score, can affect premiums, too.\n\nSince 2017, an obscure part of the insurance market, known as reinsurance, has helped push up premiums. Insurance companies buy reinsurance to help limit their exposure when a catastrophe hits. Over the past several years, reinsurance companies have experienced what Benjamin Keys and Philip Mulder, the researchers who led the new study, call a “climate epiphany.” As a result, the rates they charge to protect home insurance companies against catastrophic losses have roughly doubled.\n\nInsurance providers have, in turn, passed these costs on to homeowners. The rapid repricing of climate risk is responsible for about 20 percent of home insurance premium increases since 2017, according to Dr. Keys and Dr. Mulder.\n\nWhat else is contributing to high rates? Rebuilding costs are responsible for about 35 percent of the recent changes, the research found. Population shifts and inflation are factors, too.\n\nSince 2018, a financial shock in the home insurance market has meant that homes in the ZIP codes most exposed to hurricanes and wildfires sell for an average of $43,900 less than they otherwise would have, the research found.\n\nHome prices in Louisiana metro areas trend below the national average.\n\nNote: Chart shows percent change in Zillow Home Value Index since 2018.\n\nIn many places, insurance has been a relatively small part of the homebuying equation. Now, for many, it’s a major consideration.\n\nFor several homeowners we interviewed in Louisiana, monthly insurance costs are now higher than their home loan payments.\n\nThe research shows buyers may be factoring rising insurance costs into the prices they’re willing to pay for homes. As a result, homes in some areas are selling for less.\n\nBenjamin Keys and Philip Mulder calculated annual homeowners’ insurance costs by separating mortgage and tax payments from loan-level escrow data obtained from CoreLogic, a property and risk analytics firm. Households whose payments were captured by CoreLogic were not necessarily present in all years of data from 2014 to 2024.\n\nThe home insurance share of total home payments is based on mean values. Total home payments include insurance, property tax and mortgage principal and interest costs. Escrow payments typically do not include utilities, homeowners’ association fees.\n\nClimate change is driving rates higher, but not always in areas with the greatest risk.\n\nIt’s not just California and Florida now: Insurers are losing money around the country. It means higher rates and, sometimes, cancellation notices.\n\nWithout insurance, it’s impossible to get a mortgage; without a mortgage, most Americans can’t buy a home.\n\nThe danger from extreme weather is growing, and so are insurance costs. Here’s what to know.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/climate/50-states-fixes.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-10","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"50 States, 50 Fixes: A Look at Environmental Innovations Across America","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a diverse array of grassroots, community-led environmental initiatives across the United States.

front line of Europe's standoff with Russia's shadow fleet\n\nOut on the western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker.\n\n\"Swedish Coastguard calling… Do you consent to answer a few questions for us? Over.\"\n\nThrough heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship's insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt.\n\n\"I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,\" says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin.\n\nThis is the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\"; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports.\n\nAfter the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance.\n\nSome \"shadow\" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or \"spoofing\" their location data.\n\nOut on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating.\n\nAs the BBC has learned, a growing network of \"shadow\" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance.\n\nThat is a troubling trend, given many are practically \"floating rust buckets\", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann.  If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, \"good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost\".\n\nDriven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database.\n\nThe BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag.\n\nThe head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two.\n\nThe rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk.\n\nWhat's more, he suggests, it's brazen: \"There's no secret made about it.\"\n\nWe spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure.\n\nJourneying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction.\n\nThe BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship.\n\nTracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap.\n\nOriginally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade.\n\nBack in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea -  which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships.\n\nBy late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK.\n\nThe tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number.\n\nIn August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as \"false\". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry.\n\nThe BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called  FMTC Ship Charter LLC , but our emails and our calls went unanswered.\n\nThe beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI.\n\nOpaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection.\n\nPurged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point \"where they just don't even bother at all\", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann.\n\nUnity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it.\n\nBy 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication.\n\nThe tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties.\n\nBack in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly  detained  at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages.\n\nUnity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to  UK and EU service and port bans  as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin.\n\nNevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago.\n\nAnalysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air  finds  that \"shadow\" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself.\n\nWhile politicians  talk of toughening action , navy and coastguard officers point out that a country's power to act fades the further you go out to sea.\n\nThe right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it.\n\nCountries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event.\n\n\"There's a complexity associated with it,\" argues Commodore Ivo Värk. \"With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis.\"\n\nThe Estonians speak from experience.\n\nWhen they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has \"constantly\" had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk.\n\nThe fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken.\n\n\"Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,\" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, \"we don't want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself\".\n\n\"Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies.\"\n\nBack on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up.\n\n\"Thank you for your co-operation,\" says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia.\n\nThe exchange lasted just over five minutes.\n\n\"You need to see it in a larger perspective,\" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: \"This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.\"\n\nBut as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: \"You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.\"\n\nThere is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile \"the dark fleet is getting darker\".\n\nThe BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West's \"anti-Russian sanctions\" were \"illegitimate\" and \"undermine established principles of global commerce\".\n\n\"Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,\" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to \"easily resolved\" issues such as administrative delays.\n\nIt was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had \"heightened\" the risks by \"forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape\".\n\nAdditional reporting by Adrienne Murray, Michael Steininger and Ali Zaidi"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/19/climate/home-insurance-costs-real-estate-market.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"A Climate ‘Shock’ Is Eroding Some Home Values.

New Data Shows How Much.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-19T00:00:56-05:00\n\nThis Louisiana resident expects to pay 45 percent more for home insurance this year.\n\nSimilar increases are hitting homeowners across the state, where insurance costs have exploded over the past four years.\n\nIt’s part of a rapid shift that’s sending tremors through real estate markets across the country.\n\nBy Claire Brown and Mira Rojanasakul. Photography by Emily Kask.\n\nClaire Brown traveled to Louisiana for this article and Mira Rojanasakul combed through troves of data. Both spoke with homeowners, policymakers and insurance experts.\n\nEven after she escaped rising floodwaters by wading away from her home in chest-deep water during Hurricane Rita in 2005, Sandra Rojas, now 69, stayed put. A fifth-generation resident of Lafitte, La., a small coastal community, she raised her home with stilts.\n\nBut this year, her annual home insurance premium increased to $8,312, more than doubling over the past four years.\n\nShe considered selling, but found herself in a dilemma. As insurance costs have risen, area home values have fallen, dropping by 38 percent since 2020. The roadsides around her house are dotted with for-sale signs.\n\n“They won’t insure you,” Ms. Rojas said. “No one will buy from you. You’re kind of stuck where you are.”\n\nSandra Rojas is a fifth-generation resident of Lafitte, La.\n\nNew research shared with The New York Times estimates the extent to which rising home insurance premiums, driven higher by climate change, are cascading into the broader real estate market and eating into home values in the most disaster-prone areas.\n\nThe study, which analyzed tens of millions of housing payments through 2024 to understand where insurance costs have risen most, offers first-of-its-kind insight into the way rising insurance rates are affecting home values.\n\nSince 2018, a financial shock in the home insurance market has meant that homes in the ZIP codes most exposed to hurricanes and wildfires would sell for an average of $43,900 less than they would otherwise, the research found. They include coastal towns in Louisiana and low-lying areas in Florida.\n\nChanges in an under-the-radar part of the insurance market, known as reinsurance, have helped to drive this trend. Insurance companies purchase reinsurance to help limit their exposure when a catastrophe hits. Over the past several years, global reinsurance companies have had what the researchers call a “climate epiphany” and have roughly doubled the rates they charge home insurance providers.\n\nSource: Keys and Mulder (National Bureau of Economic Research, 2025). The New York Times\n\nBenjamin Keys at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Philip Mulder of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the authors of the study, which was published this week, have called these swift changes “a reinsurance shock.” For some Americans, these changes have made it unaffordable to remain in homes they have lived in for decades.\n\n“Homeowners don’t appreciate or don’t understand that we are living in a much riskier world than we were 25 years ago,” Dr. Keys said. “And that risk? They have to pay for it.”\n\nAfter analyzing 74 million home payments — which included mortgage, taxes and insurance and were made between 2014 and 2024 — the researchers found that a rapid repricing of disaster risk had been responsible for about a fifth of overall home insurance increases since 2017. Another third could be explained by rising construction costs.\n\nThe researchers estimated the effects of the reinsurance shock on home prices in the ZIP codes most vulnerable to catastrophes. They found that rising insurance premiums weighed down home values by about $20,500 in the top 25 percent of homes most exposed to catastrophic hurricanes and wildfires, and by $43,900 in the top 10 percent.\n\nBuying a home has long been seen as a way to lock in predictable housing costs. But the fast-increasing burden of insurance is catching some homeowners by surprise.\n\nLast year, Ms. Rojas’s brother-in-law, who lived down the road in Lafitte, decided to sell his home to escape the area’s rising premiums. It sold for $150,000, which is what it cost him to build it in 1984. He estimated he lost about $75,000 on the sale, after accounting for the cost of renovations.\n\nIn parts of the hail-prone Midwestern states, insurance now eats up more than a fifth of the average homeowner’s total housing payments, which include mortgage costs and property taxes. In Orleans Parish, La., that number is nearly 30 percent.\n\nSource: Keys and Mulder (National Bureau of Economic Research, 2025). The New York Times\n\nA hundred miles north of Lafitte, the small city of Bogalusa, La., lies further inland. Nevertheless, Cristal Holmes saw her insurance premium more than quadruple in 2022, to $500 per month, on top of her $700 monthly mortgage.\n\nMs. Holmes, a single mother who was working 56 hours a week at a warehouse, struggled to keep up with the higher bills. She fell behind on mortgage payments after her work hours were reduced to 35 per week. She worried she couldn’t stay in her home.\n\nSimilar stories are playing out all over town. Ms. Holmes’s real estate agent, Charlotte Johnson, said her office was getting phone calls every day from people who said they could no longer afford their rising insurance premiums. For many, dropping insurance is not an option, because banks refuse to offer or maintain mortgages for people without coverage.\n\nThat means owners are being forced to choose between accepting home insurance policies they can’t afford or risking foreclosure.\n\nBuyers face their own obstacles. High insurance prices and interest rates are making it harder than ever for first-time buyers to purchase homes, said Nancy Galofaro-Cruse, a senior loan officer with CMG Home Loans who works with many of Ms. Johnson’s clients. She estimated that more than a third of would-be buyers in the area backed out of the market this year after insurance and interest rates pushed their total monthly housing costs out of reach.\n\nFor-sale signs dot roadsides In Lafitte, La., where high insurance costs have driven residents to sell.\n\nIt’s not just the hurricane-prone coasts that have been affected by the reinsurance shock. In Colorado, where wildfires and hail pose the biggest threats to homes, the average homeowner’s premium has more than doubled in the last decade and median premiums have increased 74 percent since 2020.\n\nSteve Hakes, an insurance broker with Rocky Mountain Insurance Center in Lafayette, Colo., has seen clients consider homes in wildfire-prone areas, only to back out when they can’t find affordable insurance. High prices and limited availability have pushed him to advise buyers to look for insurance early in the homebuying process.\n\nAnd in California, 13 percent of real estate agents surveyed by an industry trade association said they’d had deals fall through in 2024 after buyers couldn’t find affordable insurance coverage.\n\nColorado regulators are aware of the threats these dynamics pose to the real estate market and are exploring a wide range of fixes, said Michael Conway, the Colorado insurance commissioner.\n\n“We don’t want a situation where the insurance market is effectively decimating the real estate market,” he said.\n\nAs insurance becomes more expensive, home values will need to adjust for potential buyers to afford their monthly costs, industry analysts say. And if home values fall, lower property tax revenue could mean less money for local governments to pay for essential services or affect the ability of those governments to borrow money.\n\nClarence Guidry reached a breaking point this year when he got a quote to insure his home in Lafitte, La. He’d pay a $20,000 annual premium but if a hurricane struck, he’d be on the hook for the first $50,000 in damage before the insurance company would pay out.\n\nHis lender wouldn’t let Mr. Guidry, who goes by Rosco, keep his mortgage without home insurance. But keeping his home insured against damage from hurricanes would mean stomaching monthly payments that are at least 40 percent higher than the rest of his monthly mortgage and property taxes combined.\n\nClarence Guidry, a homeowner in Lafitte, La., would need to cover the first $50,000 in hurricane damage before his home insurance would kick in.\n\nOver the last decade, as the number of wildfires and storms has mounted, losses have exceeded the revenue insurance companies receive from home insurance policies across the United States. In Louisiana, 12 companies, including Mr. Guidry’s insurer, became insolvent after a wave of hurricanes between 2021 and 2023. (Most private insurers do not cover flood damage, which is handled separately under a federal program.)\n\nNote: Data shows U.S. property catastrophe prices indexed to 1990. Source: Guy Carpenter. The New York Times\n\nInsurance companies’ own costs have climbed in recent years for a variety of reasons, including higher construction costs, higher interest rates and President Trump’s tariff policies.\n\nBut the changes in the insurance market have begun to put a higher price on risk. Reinsurers have been driving these effects, Dr. Mulder said.\n\n“These reinsurers are looking at a lot of the same data as insurers, but at a much bigger scale and with more sophistication,” he said.\n\nPoliticians, homeowners, economists, state insurance commissioners and real estate agents have long worried that insurance costs will rise so much that they will begin to pull down home values.\n\nAccording to the study by Dr. Keys and Dr. Mulder, which was published as a working paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research, this is already happening in some areas.\n\nJesse Keenan, an associate professor of sustainable real estate and urban planning at Tulane University, said the direct evidence of this phenomenon remained limited and there were factors beyond insurance that affected local home prices.\n\nBut there are increasingly troubling signs in some markets, he said.\n\n“The New Orleans housing market is exhibiting signs of failure that are imposing stress on the financial system around it,” he said.\n\nOverall, U.S. home prices have risen about 55 percent since 2018, but New Orleans prices have increased by only 14 percent, less than the rate of inflation over the same time period.\n\nHome prices in Louisiana metro areas trend below the national average.\n\nNote: Chart shows change in Zillow Home Value Index since 2018. Source: Zillow. The New York Times\n\nEven in states where heavy regulations have kept costs down, there are signs that home insurers will continue to raise premiums to align more closely with disaster risk. New rules in California allow insurance companies to pass rising reinsurance costs on to consumers. One consumer advocacy group, citing the effects of similar changes in other states, has estimated this provision could raise net premiums significantly for homeowners.\n\nBack in Lafitte, Mr. Guidry was running the numbers for his own budget. Against the advice of his financial adviser, he took money out of his retirement account to pay off his home loan. The plan now is to self-insure for wind and hail damage. That means he and his wife will have to pay out of pocket to repair their home if another severe storm hits.\n\nIn forgoing coverage, the Guidrys join some 13 percent of U.S. homeowners who are uninsured, according to Census Bureau data. Insurers continue to drop people in many areas.\n\n“Now, we’ve got to take the gamble,” Mr. Guidry said.\n\nBenjamin Keys and Philip Mulder calculated annual homeowners’ insurance costs by separating mortgage and tax payments from loan-level escrow data obtained from CoreLogic, a property and risk analytics firm. Households whose payments were captured by CoreLogic were not necessarily present in all years of data from 2014 to 2024.\n\nThe home insurance share of total home payments are based on mean values. Total home payments include insurance, property tax and mortgage principal and interest costs. Escrow payments typically do not include utilities, homeowners’ association fees.\n\nClimate change is driving rates higher, but not always in areas with the greatest risk.\n\nIt’s not just California and Florida now: Insurers are losing money around the country. It means higher rates and, sometimes, cancellation notices.\n\nWithout insurance, it’s impossible to get a mortgage; without a mortgage, most Americans can’t buy a home.\n\n"},{"source":"https://cooking.nytimes.com/article/pies-thanksgiving-desserts","dateOfPublication":"0000-01-01","timeOfPublication":"00:00:00.000Z","title":"6 Pies So Good, You’ll Want to Skip Dinner","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article from New York Times Cooking celebrates a collection of easy, delicious, and accessible pie recipes inspired by classic Thanksgiving flavors.

Thanksgiving: apple and cream, chocolaty espresso, honeyed cranberry, and more.\n\nGo straight to the good stuff this Thanksgiving: apple and cream, chocolaty espresso, honeyed cranberry, and more.\n\nIn the world of baked goods, it’s said that people usually fall into one of two camps: cake lovers or pie lovers. But we shouldn’t be so prescriptive. You can dream of both fluffy layer cakes and showstopping pies. You can find yourself craving a bite of chocolate cake one day, while yearning for apple pie the next.\n\nThat’s where my passion lies. I didn’t grow up having pie. Instead, my family and I ate cake: vanilla sponges from Chinese bakeries, sandwiching fresh whipped cream and sliced fruit, that were just sweet enough. It wasn’t until I was as an adult working at food magazines that I began making and eating pies. I came to find the whole process incredibly rewarding.\n\nUnlike a cake, which requires cooling and then frosting, a pie is ready to eat soon after you pull it from the oven, once it has taken a moment to cool — and in some of the cases below, it’s ready right away.\n\nYou don’t have to be a pie expert — or even a die-hard pie lover — to make the recipes in this collection. The pies below channel classic Thanksgiving flavors, but they’re also fruity, tangy and creamy like the cakes of my youth. (And, critically, they aren’t too sweet.) They’re also all stunning and delicious, and, most important, they’re easy, each one streamlined for success. For beginners, gingery-sweet crumb crusts and crunchy phyllo step in for trickier pie crust. The one pie that does call for dough has a simple twist: The top is shingled rather than woven into a lattice, creating a stunning result with little effort, so you can have your pie and eat it, too.\n\nThis pie takes inspiration from classic pumpkin pie, but it uses nearly the entire squash — flesh and skin — for both filling and garnish. The custard rests in a graham cracker crust, which I believe is the ideal choice for a pumpkin pie, since the crumbs actually benefit from absorbing some of the custard’s moisture. Garnished with candied squash slices, this pie is both a visual treat and a delicious one.\n\nIf I had to pick a favorite of this batch, it would be this one. The pie dough is forgiving, easy to work with and, best of all, requires no crimping. I encourage you to experiment with your top-crust design and then simply let the dough do its magic in the oven. A touch of heavy cream adds an unexpectedly perfect silkiness to the apples.\n\nHojicha, a toasted green tea from Japan with a smoky sweetness, is incorporated into a cream cheese custard with a subtle cream cheese swirl, guaranteeing that this pie will be the star of Thanksgiving. (Thankfully, this pie also travels well wherever you take it.) Baked in a shortbread crust, it feels almost like an elegant tart.\n\nThe simplest of the bunch (no pun intended) with ingredients that are available year-round, this sweet-tart banana pie skips the traditional crust in favor of phyllo dough, creating a dramatic, ruffly edge. The custard has a slight tang from the sour cream, which beautifully balances out the sometimes overly sweet banana.\n\nBuilt on a chocolate graham cracker crust with rich layers of chocolate and espresso pudding, this silky treat feels like the fanciest version of a diner-style pie. Each slice is stunning, with contrasting pudding layers and a tall cap of unsweetened whipped cream.\n\nThis dreamy creation combines lush cranberry and vanilla-honey mousses to create mesmerizing swirls of pink and white. It recalls the flavor of Yakult, a popular yogurt-like drink in East Asian cultures, and each bite melts in your mouth. A small amount of gelatin helps the mousses set and keeps them picture-perfect on the Thanksgiving table.\n\nFollow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.
