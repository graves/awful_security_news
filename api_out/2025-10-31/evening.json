So, if he asked me to come meet with him, I’d be in London tomorrow,” Sky Roberts told CNN in an interview on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  His comments come after the King took the extraordinary decision to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy this week amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re actually getting some acknowledgement from the King and saying he stands with survivors,” Roberts said, adding that the King’s response had been more positive than that of US authorities. “I think we should take a moment of appreciation for that but also call to action – to take it that next step further into an investigation, and to expedite that.”\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace declined to comment when asked about the idea of a meeting with Giuffre’s family.\n \n\n   \n  The statement released by Buckingham Palace on Thursday, which announced that Andrew would be  stripped of his titles  and honors, also said: “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, accused  the King’s brother Andrew  of sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager. Andrew has vehemently denied the accusations against him.\n \n\n   \n  The family has called for a “full investigation” and, if Andrew is found to be implicated in any crime, for him to be prosecuted “to the fullest extent of the law.”\n \n\n   \n  In her  posthumous memoir , Giuffre wrote that she was brutally beaten and raped by an unidentified prime minister and “lent” out to “scores of wealthy, powerful people” by Epstein and his circle.\n \n\n   \n  Roberts said he thinks British police and authorities likely have information about other perpetrators of sexual abuse that they could bring to light in relation to the Epstein case.\n \n\n   \n  “If you have a pile of paper sitting somewhere that can expose the truth, or at least help bring light … Do not protect people that might have been implicated. That needs to be released fully,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he would be willing to meet with Andrew as well as King Charles, Roberts said: “I don’t think there’s anything Andrew can say except for A) an extreme apology to my sister, and B) if he’s ready to come forward and actually give some sort of light to what has transpired in that inner circle” with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\n \n\n   \n  An expedited process of justice against Andrew would also involve “getting him out of his house,” Roberts said, addressing reports that the former prince will remain at the Royal Lodge in Windsor until after the holidays. “I think it shouldn’t be until Christmas. It should be tomorrow.”\n \n\n   \n  Roberts also said the United Kingdom should “find another loophole” to ensure that Andrew’s status as eighth in line to the throne is also removed. “Who cares if it takes a little bit more time and an Act of Parliament – then do it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/letitia-james-challenges-appointment-us-attorney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:57:00-04:00","title":"New York AG Letitia James challenges appointment of US attorney in Albany","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a motion to challenge the appointment of John Sarcone as US Attorney for the Northern District of New York, arguing that the appointment is improper and that the resulting subpoena seeking information about her investigations into the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association is retaliatory and violates First Amendment rights and state sovereignty.

But experts broadly emphasize the safety and benefits of fluoride.\n \n\n   \n  Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth.\n \n\n   \n  The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way. The CDC named fluoridation of drinking water  one of the 10 greatest health interventions in America  in the 20th century alongside vaccination, family planning and safer workplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Most US residents live in a community where fluoride is added to public drinking water, according to  federal data  from 2022. In places where fluoride is not in the water, fluoride tablets or drops may be prescribed for babies and children to reduce the risk of tooth decay — and reliance on fluoride supplements could become more common, as Utah and Florida became the first states to  ban the practice  of adding fluoride to drinking water and similar legislation has been introduced in several other states.\n \n\n   \n  In April, the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Environmental Protection Agency Administration  announced  that they would study the science to make a new recommendation on fluoride. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said he will tell the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation for drinking water in communities.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA launched a ”safety review and public comment period” on the issue in ​May,   ﻿and a  strategy report  from the MAHA Commission – with an agenda spearheaded by Kennedy – specifically named fluoride supplements as an issue to investigate, along with vaccine injuries and exposures to pesticides and microplastics.\n \n\n   \n  In the resulting  scientific evaluation , published Friday, the agency concluded that fluoride supplements “should not be used in children under age 3 or by older children who are not at high risk of tooth decay.”\n \n\n   \n  “For the same reason fluoride may work to kill bacteria on teeth, it may also alter the gut microbiome, which may have broader health implications,” the agency said in a news release.\n \n\n   \n  “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome. The microbiome is increasingly recognized to be central to a child’s health and development,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in the release.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA on Friday also referenced “preliminary but potentially concerning” data about the risks that fluoride can have for children’s intellectual development. A  meta-analysis published earlier this year , which would become the basis for further federal investigation, concluded that IQ drops as fluoride levels rise. But some experts have raised concerns about biases in the analysis and emphasized that it focused on levels of fluoride that are far higher than most people are exposed to.\n \n\n   \n  As water fluoridation starts to roll back in some communities, experts say that protecting the option to use prescription supplements is key. In fact, the legislation in Utah that banned the addition of fluoride to the public drinking water included provisions to expand access to prescription fluoride — and  prescriptions spiked  after the change.\n \n\n   \n  For some oral health advocates, the latest action from the FDA is a win simply because it is not an outright ban.\n \n\n   \n  “We are actually quite pleased about this decision, because fluoride supplements remain available and will continue to be a benefit to oral health,” said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist from Utah who spoke at public meeting to discuss the risks and benefits of the prescription fluoride supplements in July.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel that the decision of the FDA to continue making fluoride supplements available is an indication that all of the input generated from health professionals was heard and considered in their decision,” Bekker said in an email to CNN on Friday. “Providers can prescribe according to their consultation with parents and patients at recommended levels. We still recommend starting fluoride supplements at age 6 months in non-fluoridated water communities and will rely on knowledgeable health professionals to follow the documented science as they consider appropriate ages and dosages.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/snap-benefits-november-most-affected-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:22:00-04:00","title":"Millions of Americans Could Face Delays in SNAP Benefits Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to a government shutdown, millions of Americans relying on SNAP food assistance are facing delays in receiving their benefits, with over 26 million people scheduled to receive benefits by November 10.

Millions of Americans could still face delays to their benefits, which were scheduled to be distributed tomorrow but were disrupted by the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million people — or about 1 in 8 Americans — received food stamps in May, according to the latest USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  About 3 million people were set to receive their food stamps on November 1, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with governments of all levels to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. That figure grows to about 13.7 million by November 5 and 26.6 million by November 10. The remaining enrollees are scheduled to receive their November benefits after that.\n \n\n   \n    Who relies on SNAP benefits for food assistance\n \n\n   \n  Overall, 12% of the US population relies on SNAP for food assistance. SNAP participation ranges widely across the United States, with the highest shares in New Mexico, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.\n \n\n   \n  Households with children, an elderly individual or a non-elderly person with a disability received 83% of SNAP benefits in fiscal year 2023, according to the USDA.\n \n\n   \n  Among recipients themselves, about 39% were children, while 20% were elderly and 10% were non-elderly individuals with a disability.\n \n\n   \n  Households receive about $350 a month, on average, in SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly three-quarters of the households that rely on the benefits to afford groceries have an income below 100% of the federal poverty level.\n \n\n   \n  The assistance doesn’t expire at the end of each month, but beneficiaries typically use all the funds in the month they receive them, said Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.\n \n\n   \n  Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of good alternatives to food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Americans can turn to food pantries and other community food assistance programs, but these groups have been under pressure from rising food prices and increased need in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “The shutdown adds another layer of strain to an already stretched emergency food system,” Celia Cole, CEO of Feeding Texas, the state association of food banks, said in a statement, noting that more than 3.5 million Texans receive food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  States don’t have enough money to cover $8 billion in monthly food stamp benefits, though several have said they will beef up their food assistance programs next month.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple states have said they will pour millions of dollars into their emergency food programs — but it will be far less than the typical federal outlays in most cases.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/white-house-lincoln-bedroom-bathroom-renovation","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00-04:00","title":"Trump reveals renovated Lincoln Bedroom bathroom as his White House remodel continues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced the renovation of the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom in the White House, replacing 1940s Art Deco green tiles with black and white polished statuary marble, claiming it is historically appropriate for Abraham Lincoln’s era.

Waldenberg, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:26 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he has renovated the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom, sharing before and after images on social media as he continues to put his touch on the  White House .\n \n\n   \n  “I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump said on Truth Social. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n \n\n   \n  The president posted about the renovations aboard Air Force One en route to Florida, where he will spend the weekend. The post comes as the government remains shutdown, and the Trump administration says it will not tap into emergency funds to fund SNAP food assistance benefits through the month of November.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, Trump posted more images of the bathroom, showing gold detailing on the faucet and shower handle, as well as other fixtures. A plush white robe with presidential seal also hangs on a golden hook.\n \n\n   \n  The president discussed the changes he was making to the bathroom earlier this month during a dinner at the White House, saying in part that the old style of the bathroom “was not exactly Abe Lincoln.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have little things like at the Lincoln Bedroom. The bathroom was done by the Truman family and you know, long time ago. And it’s done in a green tile, and it’s done in a style that was not exactly Abe Lincoln,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s actually Art Deco. And Art Deco doesn’t go with, you know, 1850 and Civil Wars…But what does do is statuary marble. So I ripped it apart and we built a bathroom. It’s absolutely gorgeous and totally in keeping with that time because the Lincoln bedroom is, uh, so incredible, for those of you that have seen it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Friday also gave a status update on a separate construction project he’s overseeing at the Kennedy Center, which he said he “just inspected.”\n \n\n   \n  “The exterior columns, which were in serious danger of corrosion if something weren’t done, are completed, and look magnificent in White Enamel — Like a different place! Marble is being done, stages are being renovated, new seats, new chairs, and new fabrics will soon be installed, and magnificent high end carpeting throughout the building. It is happening faster than anticipated, one of my trademarks,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  “We are bringing this building back to life. It was dead as a doornail, but it will soon be beautiful again!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The moves are part of Trump’s effort to put his stamp on the White House – which has seen a slew of changes since he took office – and the greater DC area.\n \n\n   \n   So far, the renovations include paving over the grass in the historic Rose Garden, demolishing the East Wing to make way for a new ballroom and adorning the Oval Office with gold.\n \n\n   \n  Trump often says the White House needed a new ballroom to host world leaders, to avoid situations where they are outside and a temporary tent has to be used when it rains. And he frequently remarked that the Rose Garden paving was necessary, because women in high heels would sink into the grass during events. It now has a touch of Mar-a-Lago with the same white and yellow umbrellas at tables on the patio.\n \n\n   \n  His  redecoration  of the Oval Office to his liking, as presidents do when they take office, has tripled the number of paintings on the walls with gold just about everywhere. Trump also installed portraits of every president framed in gold on the West Colonnade – except for former President Joe Biden who is instead represented by his autopen signature – and large floor-to-ceiling mirrors, which press can see when they are escorted into the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to those changes, Trump plans to build a  new arch monument  in DC in honor of the country’s 250th anniversary.\n \n\n   \n  As he pushes forward with his plans to leave his mark on the White House and the nation’s capital, Trump this week  fired the members  of the Commission of Fine Arts. The independent federal agency is charged with advising the president, Congress and the city of Washington, DC, on “matters of design and aesthetics.” The president has also installed allies on the National Capital Planning Commission, which will be tasked with approving plans for the new ballroom on White House grounds.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-numbers-trump-fact-check","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:05:00-04:00","title":"Fact check: Trump’s false claims about his poll numbers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump claimed he had his highest poll numbers and the best approval ratings for any president in many years, but fact-checked data from multiple independent polling sources—including CNN, the New York Times, G.

But Trump also said two things about his popularity that are not even close to true.\n \n\n   \n  He said, “I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had.” And he said, “I have the best numbers for any president in many years – any president.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s approval is down markedly from his second-term peak\n \n\n   \n  In reality, polls show that Americans’ approval of Trump has declined significantly since the beginning of his second term in late January. Multiple polling averages confirm that Trump’s poll numbers are nowhere in the ballpark of their highest-ever levels.\n \n\n   \n   A New York Times average  put Trump’s net approval at negative-11 points as of Tuesday: 43% approval and 54% disapproval. That is down a  net 20 points  from the first week of the term, when Trump was at positive-9 points – 52% approval and 43% disapproval.  CNN’s Poll of Polls  average, updated Wednesday, has Trump’s net approval at negative-15 points (41% approval and 56% disapproval), down a net 14 points from our first average of the term in early February.\n \n\n   \n  Other polling averages also show large drops in Trump’s standing since the beginning of the term.\n \n\n   \n  An  average produced by G. Elliott Morris , co-founder of the polling data website  FiftyPlusOne.news , put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-14 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 26 points from the first days of the term. An  average produced by data journalist Nate Silver  put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-10 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 22 points from the first days of the term.\n \n\n   \n  The White House didn’t respond to a CNN request for comment for this article.\n \n\n   \n  It’s worth noting that Trump does continue to have  extremely high   approval   among Republicans , often in the vicinity of 90%. But he never said Tuesday that he was talking about his popularity with his own party rather than the country as a whole, and he is not at a personal record high even among Republicans in particular.\n \n\n   \n    Many other presidents had far better numbers\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current poll numbers are nowhere close to “the best numbers for any president in many years,” even if you ignore the fact that they’re not even his own best numbers in many years.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current low standing – a negative net approval, with approval specifically in the low-40s – clearly does not approach the  approval  peaks   of recent predecessors. President Barack Obama hit 69% approval in the early days of his first term, according to tracking by polling firm Gallup, while President George W. Bush hit 90% approval in the wake of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Even President Joe Biden, who struggled with weak poll numbers for much of his term, was up at 57% approval in both January 2021 and April 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s claim is also wrong even if he was referring specifically to other presidents’ poll numbers on the same date of a term.\n \n\n   \n  Biden had low net approval on the equivalent day of his term, but it was still better than Trump’s in both  Morris’s average  and  Silver’s average . And Trump’s boast about beating “any president in many years” clearly suggested he was comparing himself to other presidents in addition to Biden; the data shows that  every other person elected president after World War II  had better poll numbers than Trump on the equivalent date in their ​first term, in both net approval and approval alone.\n \n\n   \n  Silver’s  historical tracking  shows that, on the date Trump made this claim while having a roughly negative-10 net approval, Obama had about a positive-9 net approval in his first term, George W. Bush about positive-76, President Bill Clinton positive-2, President George H.W. Bush about positive-38, President Ronald Reagan about positive-20, President Jimmy Carter about positive-24, President Richard Nixon about positive-27, President John F. Kennedy about positive-65, President Dwight D. Eisenhower about positive-45, and President Harry Truman about positive-41.\n \n\n   \n  It would be fair to point out that Trump is serving a (non-consecutive) second term rather than a first term. But that added context doesn’t make Trump’s assertion correct. Gallup, which  assessed presidential approval on a quarter-by-quarter basis , found that, other than Nixon, Trump had a lower average approval in his 19th quarter as president – the third quarter of the second term, running from July 20 through October 19 – than any president elected to two terms from at least Eisenhower in the 1950s onward.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-strikes-pacific-drug-trafficking","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:03:00Z","title":"Pentagon shifts to Pacific strikes seeking stronger link between targets and US drug trafficking","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon has shifted its military strikes against suspected drug traffickers from the Caribbean Sea to the eastern Pacific Ocean, citing stronger intelligence that cocaine is trafficked from Colombia and Mexico to the United States, not Venezuela.

targets and US drug trafficking \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:03 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon has deliberately shifted its strategy in recent weeks to striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, according to people familiar with the matter,\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia or Mexico, rather than Venezuela, the sources said, raising more questions about the true purpose of the US military buildup in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  The last four US military strikes targeting suspected drug smugglers were carried out in the eastern Pacific, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and sources said that future attacks are likely to be concentrated in that area because of the stronger link to US markets.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, there have been questions about whether every boat struck by the US in the Caribbean was actually heading toward, or sending drugs to, the US. After the first boat strike in September, for example, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the vessel had likely been headed toward Trinidad and Tobago.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is also not known to be a major source of cocaine for the US market, but the Trump administration has been aggressively trying to link Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to the drug trade while accumulating a huge military presence near Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not provided Congress with evidence to back up its claims that the 15 vessels the military has struck since September in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 61 people, were ferrying drugs and carrying known drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  During a classified briefing on Capitol Hill this week, Pentagon officials also told lawmakers they do not know how to gauge success in the ongoing military campaign, according to a source familiar with the closed-door session.\n \n\n   \n  “They don’t know whether there’s any data or metrics that would show (the strikes are) impeding the flow of drugs, whether there has been an increase in the price due to higher demand or lower supply, like there’s just no information,” the source said. “None of the briefers could say what they’re going to do when the traffickers change their tactics. None of them could say how they’re addressing air and land routes.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs said following the briefing on Thursday that administration officials confirmed that they do not necessarily know the individual identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it.\n \n\n   \n  “They said that they do not need to positively identify individuals on the vessel to do the strikes,” Jacobs said, adding that the administration did not want to detain or try survivors in court, “because they could not satisfy the evidentiary burden.” The US military briefly held and then repatriated two survivors of one of its strikes earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials also told lawmakers on Thursday that the strikes were targeting cocaine, not fentanyl.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump told a collection of senior military brass assembled during an  unusual event in Virginia last month  that the strikes were primarily targeting fentanyl transporting ships.\n \n\n   \n  “These boats, they’re stacked up with bags of white powder, that’s mostly fentanyl and other drugs too,” he said. “Every boat kills 25,000.”\n \n\n   \n  Fentanyl killed more than double the number of Americans than cocaine did in 2023, according to  US government data . By Trump’s math, the campaign against alleged drug boats thus far should prevent roughly 375,000 deaths, or slightly more than the total population of Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Jacobs said the briefers insisted that cocaine is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl but it was not a satisfactory answer for most of us.”\n \n\n   \n  “None of them could say what they’re doing for fentanyl,” said the source familiar with the briefing. “Fentanyl is the real problem here, and they’re actually not addressing fentanyl in any of these operations.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats and Republicans also want a better explanation of the legal justification for the strikes, but military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings. The legal counsel to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was supposed to brief lawmakers on Thursday but pulled out after it became clear that lawyers from the defense secretary’s office were given a “pass” at attending, sources told CNN. Without the lawyers there, Democrats said the briefers could not fully answer their questions about the legality of the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t even show up with the lawyers,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts said after the briefing. “They canceled at the last minute.”\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth told reporters on Friday while traveling in Asia that he had engaged with Congress on a bipartisan basis about the strikes. But also on Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said.\n \n\n   \n  The letters requested the execute orders for the US military strikes on the boats, and the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that CNN has reported the administration is leaning on to legally justify the strikes. Some Republican senators were shown the OLC memo by administration officials during a briefing on Wednesday, infuriating Democrats who were not invited to the briefing and have still not seen document.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner called the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/snap-benefits-november-judge-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"19:15:00-04:00","title":"Will SNAP benefits be paid in November?

Here’s what we know about the judges’ rulings \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:15 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges have  ordered  the Trump administration to use emergency funds to provide at least partial  food stamp benefits  to tens of millions of Americans in November, as the federal government shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  And President Donald Trump on Friday evening said that he’s instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the much needed assistance won’t come that quickly for many food stamp recipients. Also, it remains unclear whether they’ll receive their full benefits or a smaller amount since the US Department of Agriculture’s contingency fund doesn’t have enough money to cover the total cost.\n \n\n   \n  Several legal and procedural challenges must be overcome before the benefits can start flowing to the nearly 42 million people in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. The US Department of Agriculture halted November allocations, arguing it  doesn’t have the funds  to provide them, which prompted  a coalition of Democratic-led states  and a group of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to sue earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  It’s now unclear whether the administration will appeal the rulings. However, the Justice Department signaled during a hearing on Thursday that it would do so if US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston issued an adverse ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n \n\n   \n  A judge in Rhode Island said during proceedings Friday in a separate case over the SNAP payments that he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure some benefits could be distributed starting November 1. The administration could also appeal this decision.\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  Whatever happens in court, it will take time for SNAP recipients to get access to any assistance in November.\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of  issuing benefits for November  after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  The delay will be felt immediately. Some 3 million recipients should receive their benefits on November 1, according to an estimate by Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. The number grows to nearly 13.7 million by November 5, with remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not going out on time,” Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said of the November benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Still, providing full payments would be the fastest way to get assistance to food stamp recipients.\n \n\n   \n  “If the administration complies with the courts’ rulings to release the SNAP contingency funds immediately and supplements those amounts using its legal transfer authority, which the courts also affirmed, then SNAP benefits could begin to be issued with only a short delay,” said Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n    Partial payments harder to do\n \n\n   \n  However, the process could become much more complicated — and time consuming — if the USDA opts to only tap into its contingency fund and doesn’t augment it with leftover tariff revenue dedicated to child nutrition programs, as it did with the  WIC nutrition assistance program .\n \n\n   \n  The emergency fund only has $5.3 billion remaining in it, while benefits total about $8.2 billion for the month, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which represents the USDA in the case. (Other expenses and benefits bring the total closer to $9 billion.)\n \n\n   \n  The USDA also has access to nearly $17 billion in tariff revenue, but a Justice Department attorney told a judge Friday that using the funds for SNAP would hurt the child nutrition programs that the money supports. Both Talwani and the judge in Rhode Island, John McConnell, left it up to the USDA to decide whether to use the additional resources to pay full benefits in November.\n \n\n   \n  If only the contingency fund were tapped, the USDA would have to reduce benefits for all SNAP recipients, which it has never done, according to a declaration filed by the agency official who oversees the program. Also, state agencies would need to recode their systems to issue the smaller benefit amounts, which could result in payment errors.\n \n\n   \n  “Because no template, processes, or past experience exist to inform a reduction in benefits, there are multiple variables which could lead to significant problems in attempting to reduce benefits for every SNAP household in the country,” Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of the USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said in his declaration. “The ability, time and resources to accomplish this system change would vary greatly among State agencies, with some State agencies working with systems that are decades old.”\n \n\n   \n  For at least some states, the process could take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, Penn said, drawing upon informal conversations with state agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Before states could even act, the USDA would also have to determine how to calculate and authorize the reduced allotments. This effort could be hampered if its employees have been furloughed during the shutdown or laid off or departed amid the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government, Plata-Nino said.\n \n\n   \n  While some states have identified potential ways to issue smaller benefits quickly, the methods must be programmed, tested and verified, which could take time, she noted.\n \n\n   \n  If recipients receive partial benefits in November, they would get retroactive payments to make them whole once the government reopens, she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/middleeast/turkey-ski-resort-fire-sentence-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00-04:00","title":"Turkish court sentences hotel owner and 10 others to life for deadly fire that killed 78","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Turkish court sentenced hotel owner Halit Ergul and 10 others to life imprisonment for severe negligence in a deadly fire at the Grand Kartal Hotel in Bolu province on January 21, 2025, which killed 78 people, including 34 children, and injured 133 others.

life for deadly fire that killed 78 \n       \n  Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:26 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A  Turkish court  on Friday sentenced the owner of a ski resort hotel and 10 others to life in prison after convicting them of severe negligence in connection with a  deadly fire  that swept through the property, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  The blaze hit the 12-story  Grand Kartal Hotel  at the Kartalkaya ski resort in the province of Bolu on January 21 during the winter school break,  killing 78 people  and injuring 133 others. A total of 34 children taking family vacations were among the victims.\n \n\n   \n  The court convicted hotel owner Halit Ergul, along with his wife, two daughters, hotel managers, a deputy mayor and a deputy fire chief of negligence with “probable intent to kill.” They were each sentenced to life imprisonment for the deaths of the children, and received an additional 25 years in prison for the 44 other fatalities.\n \n\n   \n  The defendants, who have rejected responsibility for the deaths, were expected to appeal the decision. The courtroom broke into applause after the verdicts were read, with families welcoming the sentence, Haberturk news channel reported.\n \n\n   \n  The disaster forced terrified guests and hotel staff to leap from windows or dangle bedsheets to escape rooms engulfed in smoke and flames. It sent shockwaves across Turkey, sparking widespread calls for accountability over negligence and safety violations.\n \n\n   \n  Family members and friends of the victims staged demonstrations outside the courthouse during each hearing, holding up posters of their loved ones and demanding justice.\n \n\n   \n  According to the indictment, the fire began at 3:17 a.m. when a spark from an electric grill ignited a garbage bin and ruptured a liquefied petroleum gas hose, triggering the blaze. Staff noticed the flames seven minutes later, but within two minutes, the fire had spread beyond control. Air from an open door accelerated the flames, which quickly engulfed the wooden ceiling.\n \n\n   \n  Poor safety measures — including lack of smoke extraction, faulty alarms, inadequate staff training and missing sprinkler systems — allowed fumes to fill upper floors. Stairwells and elevator shafts acted like chimneys, and the absence of emergency lighting, signage and alternative exits prevented the safe evacuation of the hotel’s 238 guests, the indictment said.\n \n\n   \n  The hotel first opened in 1999, and has been operated by Ergul’s company since 2007.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/government-shutdown-billions-federal-aid-dries-up","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:59:00Z","title":"‘I feel guilty eating a meal’: Low-income families prepare to lose access to billions in federal aid","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown enters its one-month mark, millions of low-income Americans are facing severe hardship due to the suspension of key federal safety net programs.

billions in federal aid \n       \n  By Isabelle Khurshudyan, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:59 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Annemarie King is eating only once a day, and her husband, Randall, is picking up extra shifts at the drywall factory where he works. They are among the nearly 42 million Americans preparing for their food stamp benefits to run dry in November because of the ongoing  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The Kings, who live in Cincinnati and have eight young children, depend on the roughly $1,000 in food stamps that they receive at the start of every month to stock their refrigerator with fresh fruits, vegetables and meat.\n \n\n   \n  But since the US Department of Agriculture  announced in mid-October  that it doesn’t have the funding to provide next month’s benefits during the government shutdown, Annemarie, a stay-at-home mother, has been buying more canned and boxed items and preparing less for dinner.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also going without food herself. Her 11-year-old son has noticed, she said, but she tells him not to worry and that she ate while he was at school.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel guilty eating a meal,” Annemarie said. “I don’t want to take food away from them.”\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown nears the one-month mark, it’s not just furloughed federal workers feeling the financial strain. Low-income households across the country will lose access to  key social safety net programs  in the coming days as billions of dollars in federal funding dries up.\n \n\n   \n  Beginning November 1, more than 65,000 children and families could lose access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources, according to the National Head Start Association. For some parents, that means they might have to quit their jobs because they won’t have child care anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Others are worried they might not get heat subsidies from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program before the winter months. On top of that, roughly 24 million Americans who receive health insurance through the Affordable Care Act are preparing for what is likely to be a  significant increase  in premiums next year.\n \n\n   \n  In interviews with people in cities across the country, the early implications of the stop in federal funding for low-income families are starting to come into focus. Food banks and other charities are expecting higher demand, as millions face increasingly desperate situations without the programs they rely on.\n \n\n   \n  At the Kings’ household, the loss of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, means that instead of serving chicken, a fresh vegetable and either mashed potatoes or macaroni and cheese, Annemarie has been cooking chicken and canned green beans. Chilis, pastas and roasts are on the menu more often since they can last for a few days.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family is suffering because neither side will compromise,” Annemarie said of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.  “It’s no longer a Democrat thing, it’s no longer a Republican thing. It’s our lives.”\n \n\n   \n  The status of SNAP funding for November is currently uncertain, however. A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight between Democratic-led states and the Trump administration over its US Department of Agriculture’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to provide benefits next month.\n \n\n   \n  However the judge rules, millions of Americans will not receive their food stamp benefits on time. An estimated 3 million people will be affected on November 1 alone, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n   Food pantries  around the country are preparing for a surge in demand next week if people don’t receive their SNAP stipends. But food bank directors have warned that they can provide only a fraction of the meals that are supplied by federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  And for some households, the loss of more than one of these programs has a compounding effect.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, Ohio – about an hour outside Cincinnati – the closure of the local Head Start program means Lauren Lowe, 42, will likely have to quit her job as a restaurant server. She and her husband were able to both work full time while their 4-year-old son, Carter, attended Head Start on weekdays.\n \n\n   \n  He and 176 other kids got meals and health care there. And he loved his friends and teachers, Lowe said. Since she’s had to tell him that this will be his last week in the program, Carter is “broken-hearted right now. He’s crying every single morning because he wants to be in school with his friends,” Lowe said.\n \n\n   \n  Lowe is feeling uneasy, too. Quitting her job means less income for the household – in addition to missing their food stamp benefits. \n \n\n   \n  “It’s really scary because, how do we make ends meet?” Lowe said. “I either stay home and school my child or figure out how we’re going to pay the bills to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowe will also have to replace the two meals Carter was getting every day he was at Head Start.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday mornings, kids do come in hungrier than usual, so we know they’re really dependent on that breakfast, lunch and snack we give them,” said Julia Wise, the executive director of the Highland County Community Action Organization, which runs the Hillsboro Head Start program. \n \n\n   \n  Wise said 45 Head Start staff will be furloughed on Monday. Other Head Start programs — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit.\n \n\n   \n  In the Kansas City area, 17 programs with grants expiring on November 1 decided to take a “financial risk” by staying open, said Kasey Lawson, the Head Start director for the Mid-America Regional Council. The providers do not know if they will be reimbursed later when the new grant year is funded.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, teachers prepared homework packets that will take the kids through the end of November, so they can keep studying even when the program is closed. Some of that staff will likely   get other jobs before the government shutdown ends, meaning whenever Head Start does get funding again, it might not have enough educators to reopen all its classrooms, Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  For those who can’t find other work, “they’re going on furlough, they’re not going to have money coming in, so they could apply for SNAP benefits, but now SNAP is not going to be available either,” Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  “This is impacting us across the board,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  In rural Oregon, where the temperatures are already dipping below the freezing mark, the suspension of funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, is putting lives at risk, said Sheri Gutierrez, energy program manager at Community Action Program of East Central Oregon, a nonprofit that provides a range of services for residents in need.\n \n\n   \n  The $4 billion program, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start; the aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December.\n \n\n   \n  But barely a month into the season, Community Action in Oregon already has more than $200,000 in grant payments that are on hold until the government reopens. Many of its clients heat their homes with propane, wood and heating oil, and they don’t enjoy the same continuous service and shutoff protections available to many people who use electricity and natural gas to stay warm.\n \n\n   \n  The delay has worried local residents, some of whom are using old space heaters or their ovens, which Gutierrez says aren’t safe.\n \n\n   \n  “We hear the desperation when speaking to these clients on a daily basis. People want reassurance that they will get assistance,” she said. “LIHEAP is lifesaving. Without heat, they won’t survive.”\n \n\n   \n  In Lakeville, Minnesota, Ronda Beck is also waiting for help from LIHEAP to cover the electric bill. After speaking with her utility company “at great length,” Beck was told she could pay whatever she can until her grant is funded and she won’t be disconnected. But she’s not sure how she’ll scrape together a couple of bucks since she’s not working.\n \n\n   \n  “Where do I get $5 from?” She said. “It’s a tough situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Beck figured she could survive on groceries she picks up from her local food pantries if she and her adult son stop receiving food stamps next month – that is until she found out on Tuesday that one of the groups is only providing two or three days of food, instead two weeks’ worth. Now, she’s terrified.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to go hungry,” said Beck, who along with her son is looking for jobs in Lakeville, Minnesota, where they live. “I don’t want to walk into [a food pantry] and have them say, ‘We’re at our limit’.”\n \n\n   \n  Just outside Washington DC, Willissa Bullock worries about her food bank running out, as it’s dealing with a surge in demand from furloughed federal workers in the area. When the Landover, Maryland, resident heard that the USDA would not issue benefits next month, Bullock says she cried – nervous about how she would provide for her kids, who are in college.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Bullock left a local food pantry run by No Limits Outreach Ministries with only enough items – including lettuce, apple juice, and canned goods – to last two or three days. Until recently, her shopping cart would be overflowing.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m telling the kids to look for jobs,” said Bullock, who is unemployed and applying for disability after having back surgery. “It’s the only way we’ll be able to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  The food pantry has been receiving fewer shipments from Capital Area Food Bank after two  Covid 19-era relief programs  were canceled earlier this year. The pantry used to be able to offer meat, fish, eggs and milk to its clients, but now it mostly has beans, rice and canned foods, said Oliver Carter, pastor of No Limits Outreach Ministries.\n \n\n   \n  “Our storage used to be full and now it’s almost empty,” Carter said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/jeffrey-epstein-financial-records-unsealed-jp-morgan","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:16:00Z","title":"Newly unsealed Epstein records shed light on years of his financial transactions with Wall St. figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Newly unsealed court records reveal that JPMorgan Chase filed over 20 suspicious activity reports (SARs) between 2002 and 2019 regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s financial transactions, including over $1 billion in activity from 2003 to 2019 with Wall Street figures, Russian banks, and high-profile individuals.

Two accounts included in the report were linked to Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank.\n \n\n   \n  The bank wrote in the SAR it was flagging the transactions because of negative media about Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking of minors, media reports of allegations Epstein misappropriating money as an investment adviser, his use of multiple accounts, the Russian banks, and his relationships with two US presidents.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged with sex trafficking underaged girls. He died weeks later by suicide in the Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Jed Rakoff ordered the unsealing of the records, which were part of a lawsuit between the US Virgin Islands and JPMorgan Chase, following requests by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal. In 2023, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit from survivors of Epstein and an additional $75 million to settle with USVI, where Epstein owned an island. There was no admission of wrongdoing in these settlements.\n \n\n   \n  The documents are the latest in a slow release of materials tied to Epstein as public demand for accountability and transparency about Epstein has gone global. Thursday, Britain’s King Charles took the extraordinary step of stripping his brother Andrew of his prince title. The Justice Department remains under pressure to release more information about its investigation into Epstein, and House lawmakers are taking depositions for their investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Included in the hundreds of pages of unsealed documents are emails between Epstein and Jes Staley, a former top official at JPMorgan bank, who in 2021 resigned as head of Barclays bank following media scrutiny over his long relationship with Epstein. This year, Staley  said  he didn’t know about Epstein’s involvement with underaged girls but admitted in court that he had sex with one of Epstein’s assistants.\n \n\n   \n  Among the pages are emails between Epstein and Staley, with Epstein suggesting he could set up meetings for Staley to recruit new clients including the co-founders of Google and heads of nations.  None of the individuals were accused of any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Epstein’s death in 2019, JPMorgan filed a number of SARs involving the disgraced financier’s accounts, and the documents show banking officials shared news articles about Epstein’s alleged activities. JPMorgan closed its accounts with Epstein in 2013, five years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and reached a non-prosecution agreement with the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida.\n \n\n   \n  The newly unsealed records include the SARs, including one dating as far back as 2002, as well as the last one filed in September 2019.\n \n\n   \n  “Generally, the only new material here is the SARs themselves. Those basically summarize financial information produced in litigation, much of which has been public for years. The SARs do confirm what’s been inferred all along: the bank filed SARs about Epstein early on, and specifically when it exited Epstein from the bank in 2013 – and repeatedly between 2013 and 2019, as required,” said Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase.   “It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years.”\n \n\n   \n  In the batch of documents, there’s a letter from the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida which in 2007 sought records from Bear Stearns, one of Epstein’s banks that was later acquired by JPMorgan, as part of its then investigation into Epstein that resulted in the non-prosecution agreement.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest Wall Street names mentioned on the list of transactions on the 2019 SAR is Leon Black, a long-time associate of Epstein, who has maintained that Epstein gave him financial advice.\n \n\n   \n  “After an exhaustive investigation more than four years ago, the Dechert law firm concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein only for tax and estate planning advice that saved him and his family billions of dollars. To imply that Epstein somehow had influence over Mr. Black is false and patently absurd,” Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, said in a statement. “Indeed, it was Mr. Black who fired Epstein because he was disruptive and believed the fees for his services were excessive. The Dechert Report also found that Mr. Black had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.”\n \n\n   \n  The unsealed records include emails between Staley and Epstein about meeting in 2010 with then Prince Andrew. The then-Prince emailed Staley, “Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, has asked JPMorgan for banking records and suggested officials turned a blind eye to Epstein’s conduct to make millions of dollars in fees from his accounts.\n \n\n   \n  In a recent response, the bank denied knowledge of Epstein’s activities, writing, “with the exception of former JPMC executive Jes Staley, the bank’s executives (current and former) are respected professionals who acted with integrity and would never have allowed Epstein to remain a client if they knew of his ongoing crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Firm deeply regrets having had Epstein as a client and would never have continued doing business with him if it believed he engaged in ongoing criminal conduct,” the bank also said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/state-medicaid-undocumented-immigrants-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:22:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s HHS Orders State Medicaid Programs to Help Find Undocumented Immigrants","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has ordered state Medicaid programs to verify the immigration status of enrolled individuals, resulting in over 170,000 names being reviewed across five states and Washington, D.C.

But the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz, said in a post on the social platform X on Oct. 31 that more than $1 billion “of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants” in five states and Washington, D.C.\n \n\n   \n  Medicaid’s overall spending topped $900 billion in fiscal year 2024.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t clear from Oz’s statement or an accompanying video over what period the spending happened, and CMS spokespeople did not immediately respond to questions, either for an earlier version of this article or after Oz’s statement was posted.\n \n\n   \n  Only U.S. citizens and some lawfully present immigrants are eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income and disabled people, and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program. Those without legal status are ineligible for federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, and plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  At least one state said it disagreed with Oz’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Our payments for coverage of undocumented individuals are in accordance with state and federal laws,” said Marc Williams, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Department of Health Care Policy & Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program. “The $1.5 million number referenced by federal leaders today is based on an incorrect preliminary finding, and has been refuted with supporting data by our Department experts.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “It is disappointing that the administration is announcing this number as final when it is clearly overstated and the conversations are very much in the education and discussion phase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, CMS began sending states the names of people enrolled in Medicaid that the agency suspected might not be eligible, demanding state Medicaid agencies check their immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News in October reached out to Medicaid agencies in 10 states. Five provided the approximate number of names they had received from the Trump administration, with expectations of more to come: Colorado had been given about 45,000 names, Ohio 61,000, Pennsylvania 34,000, Texas 28,000, and Utah 8,000. More than 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  Most of those states declined to comment further. Medicaid agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and South Carolina refused to say how many names they were ordered to review or did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said in his X post that California had misspent $1.3 billion on care for people not eligible for Medicaid, while Illinois spent $30 million, Oregon $5.4 million, Washington state $2.4 million, Washington, D.C., $2.1 million, and Colorado $1.5 million.\n \n\n   \n  “We notified the states, and many have begun refunding the money,” he said. “But what if we had never asked?”\n \n\n   \n  Washington, D.C.’s Medicaid director, Melisa Byrd, said CMS had identified administrative expenses for the district program that covers people regardless of immigration status that should not have been billed to the federal government and her agency has already fixed some of those areas. “We run a big program that is very complex and when mistakes or errors happen, we fix them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The program plans to pay $654,014 back to CMS by mid-November.\n \n\n   \n  All five states, plus Washington, D.C., are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump didn’t win any of them in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill  began posting pictures  on X of people he said are convicted criminals living in the U.S. without authorization who had received Medicaid benefits.\n \n\n   \n  O’Neill could not be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “We are very concerned because this seems, frankly, to be a waste of state resources and furthers the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior health advocacy strategist with the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. “This duplicates what states already do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the administration’s crackdown on people in the U.S. without authorization, President Donald Trump in February directed federal agencies to take action to ensure they are not obtaining benefits in violation of federal law.\n \n\n   \n  In June, advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered CMS to share information about Medicaid enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security, drawing a lawsuit by some states alarmed that the administration would use the information for its deportation campaign against unauthorized residents.\n \n\n   \n  In August, a federal judge ordered HHS to  stop sharing the information  with immigration authorities.\n \n\n   \n  State Medicaid agencies use databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify enrollees’ immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  If states need to go back to individuals to reverify their citizenship or immigration status, it could lead some to fall off the rolls unnecessarily — for example, if they don’t see a letter requesting paperwork or fail to meet a deadline to respond.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not sure that evidence suggests there really is a need for this” extra verification, said Marian Jarlenski, a health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.\n \n\n   \n  Oz made clear that the Trump administration disagrees.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether willful or not, the states’ conduct highlights a terrifying reality: American taxpayers have been footing the bill for illegal immigrants’ Medicaid coverage, despite many Democrats and the media insisting otherwise,” Oz said in his X post.\n \n\n   \n  In an August press release, CMS said it would ask states to verify eligibility for enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases. “We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, called the CMS order to states “unprecedented” in the Medicaid program’s 60-year history.\n \n\n   \n  He said the federal government may have been unable to verify certain individuals’ immigration status because names were misspelled or outdated, such as when a beneficiary is identified by their maiden instead of married name. The names may also include people helped by Emergency Medicaid, a program that covers the cost of hospital emergency services, including labor and delivery, for people regardless of immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS is conducting pointless immigration status reviews for people whose hospital bills were paid by Emergency Medicaid,” Cuello said.\n \n\n   \n  Oz noted in his post that federal law “does permit states to use Medicaid dollars for emergency treatment, regardless of patients’ citizenship or immigration status,” and that states can “legally build Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants using their own state tax dollars, so long as no federal tax dollars are used.”\n \n\n   \n  The states Oz mentioned all  run their own  such programs.\n \n\n   \n  The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July. The measure, which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, makes many changes to Medicaid, including adding a work requirement in most states starting by 2027. The law also requires most states to more frequently check the eligibility of many adult Medicaid enrollees — at least twice a year.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear states may do unnecessary checks that create a burden for some enrollees who will lose health coverage who should not,” Cuello said. “It’s going to be a whole lot of work for CMS and states for very little pay dirt.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuello said the effort may have “greater political value than actual value.”\n \n\n   \n  Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid in the state, said the state already requires every Medicaid applicant to verify their citizenship or, where applicable, their eligible immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  However, he said, the directive issued by CMS “constitutes a new process, and DHS is carefully reviewing the list in order to take appropriate actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Oz did not name Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2024, in his post.\n \n\n   \n  If a lawful resident does not have a Social Security number, the state confirms their legal status by checking a database from Homeland Security, as well as verifying specific immigration documents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our teams just received this notice and are working through a process by which we will perform these reviews,” Jennifer Strohecker, then Utah’s Medicaid director, told a state advisory board in August.\n \n\n   \n   Renuka Rayasam and Rae Ellen Bichell contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/michigan-potential-terrorist-attack-averted-fbi","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:03:00Z","title":"FBI Averts Potential ISIS-Inspired Terror Attack in Michigan During Halloween Weekend","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI averted a potential ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in Michigan during Halloween weekend after detecting online discussions among individuals who planned a violent act.

\n\n   \n  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,  Volker Türk , called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organization.\n \n\n   \n  Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk’s office, relayed his message Friday at a regular UN briefing: “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.”\n \n\n   \n  She said Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.”\n \n\n   \n  US President  Donald Trump  has justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The strikes and the US military’s growing presence near Venezuela have stoked fears that the Trump administration could  try to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Friday if he’s considering land strikes in Venezuela,  Trump said, “No.”  He did not elaborate as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as he heads to Florida for the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking earlier this week from the USS George Washington aircraft carrier in Japan, Trump noted the US attacks at sea and reiterated that “now we’ll stop the drugs coming in by land.”\n \n\n   \n  US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest US military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

administration to use emergency funds to partially cover food stamp benefits \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:20 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November.\n \n\n   \n  The rulings from judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island reject a controversial US Department of Agriculture claim that it could not use a contingency fund, which the agency says has $5.3 billion remaining in it, to help cover the benefits amid the month-long government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program costs between $8 billion and $9 billion a month, so the orders will not cover all of the needed payments for November.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no doubt that the … contingency funds are appropriated funds that are without a doubt necessary to carry out the program’s operation.” US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island said. “The shutdown of the government through funding doesn’t do away with SNAP, it just does away with the funding of it.”\n \n\n   \n  McConnell’s ruling during a hastily scheduled hearing came minutes after US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston made a similar order. Both judges, appointees of President Barack Obama, also said that USDA is allowed to tap into another bucket of money of nearly $17 billion to pay November SNAP benefits in full, but that decision is currently up to the administration.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration opposes tapping into those other funds, arguing it will hurt the child nutrition programs that the revenue supports.\n \n\n   \n  “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program. And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds … to avoid any reductions,”  Talwani said in a 15-page order. \n \n\n   \n  However, millions of recipients will still face delays in getting their benefits, which were scheduled to start being distributed on November 1. It will take time for the Department of Agriculture and states to get the money flowing again.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump suggested Friday that the government could continue to fund critical food aid beyond November 1, contradicting his administration’s prior insistence there was no money available to maintain the benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “Well, there always is,” Trump said in response to a question from a reporter about whether the administration could find funding for SNAP, before arguing that it’d be simpler for Democrats to side with Republicans and vote to reopen the government. “But all the Democrats have to do is say, let’s go. I mean, they don’t have to do anything — all they have to do is say the government is open.”\n \n\n   \n  In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  The Boston lawsuit was filed earlier this week by a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the case in Rhode Island was brought Thursday by a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could seek appeals. Asked earlier Friday by CNN what the department would do if courts required USDA to tap into the contingency fund, Secretary Brooke Rollins said, “We’re looking at all the options.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so.

31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Republican-dominated Ohio panel adopted new US House districts on Friday that could boost the GOP’s chances of winning two additional seats in next year’s elections and aid President Donald Trump’s efforts to hold on to a slim congressional majority.\n \n\n   \n  The action by the Ohio Redistricting Commission came as  Virginia’s  Democratic-led General Assembly advanced a proposed constitutional amendment that could pave the way for redistricting in the state ahead of congressional midterm elections next year. The Senate on Friday passed a resolution that would allow lawmakers to temporarily bypass a bipartisan redistricting commission and gerrymander their maps. The House had advanced it Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been urging Republican-led states to reshape their US House districts in an attempt to win more seats. But unlike in other states, Ohio’s redistricting was required by the state constitution because the current districts were adopted after the 2020 census without bipartisan support.\n \n\n   \n  Ohio joins Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers already have revised their congressional districts.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have been pushing back. California voters are deciding Tuesday on a redistricting plan passed by the Democratic-led legislature.\n \n\n   \n  The political parties are in an intense battle. Democrats need to gain just three seats in next year’s election to win control of the House and gain the power to impede Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, Republicans already hold 10 of 15 congressional seats. The new map could boost Republican chances in already competitive districts currently held by Democratic Reps. Greg Landsman in Cincinnati and Marcy Kaptur near Toledo. Kaptur won a 22nd term last year by about 2,400 votes, or less than 1 percentage point, in a district carried by Trump. Landsman was reelected with more than 54% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n    Ohio residents criticize new map\n \n\n   \n  Ohio’s commission had faced a Friday deadline to adopt a new map, or else the task would have fallen to the GOP-led legislature, which could have crafted districts even more favorable to Republicans. But any redistricting bill passed by the legislature could have been subject to an initiative petition campaign from opponents seeking to force a public referendum on the new map.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty of that legislative process provided commissioners of both parties with some incentive for compromise. All seven commissioners — five Republicans and two Democrats — voted for the new map.\n \n\n   \n  But Ohio residents who testified to commissioners Friday denounced the new districts. Julia Cattaneo, who wore a shirt saying “gerrymandering is cheating,” said the new map is gerrymandered more for Republicans than the one it is replacing and is not the sort of compromise needed.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, you are compromising — your integrity, honor, duty and to represent Ohioans,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Added resident Scott Sibley: “This map is an affront to democracy, and you should all — every one of you — be ashamed.”\n \n\n   \n  Republican state Auditor Keith Farber, a member of the commission, defended the map during a testy exchange with one opponent. Because many Democrats live in cities and many Republicans in rural areas, he said there was no way to draw a map creating eight Republican and seven Democratic districts — as some had urged — without splitting cities, counties and townships.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia Democrats point at Trump to defend redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Virginia is represented in the US House by six Democrats and five Republicans. Democratic lawmakers haven’t unveiled their planned new map, nor how many seats they are trying to gain, but said their moves are necessary to respond to the Trump-inspired gerrymandering in Republican-led states.\n \n\n   \n  “Our voters are asking to have that voice. They’re asking that we protect democracy, that we not allow gerrymandering to happen throughout the country, and we sit back,” said Democratic Sen. Barbara Favola.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed constitutional amendment would let lawmakers temporarily bypass a bipartisan commission and redraw congressional districts to their advantage. The measure would still need to pass the General Assembly again next year, then go before voters in a statewide referendum.\n \n\n   \n  The developments come as Virginia holds statewide elections Tuesday, where all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are on the ballot. Democrats would need to keep their slim majority in the lower chamber to advance the constitutional amendment next year.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Mark Obenshain said Democrats were ignoring the will of voters who had overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan redistricting commission.\n \n\n   \n  “Heaven forbid that we actually link arms and work together on something,” Obenshain said. “What the voters of Virginia said is, ‘We expect redistricting to be an issue that we work across the aisle on, that we link arms on.’”\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, who has long championed the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission, noted the panel still would be in charge of redistricting after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not trying to end the practice of fair maps,” he said. “We are asking the voters if, in this one limited case, they want to ensure that a constitutional-norm-busting president can’t break the entire national election by twisting the arms of a few state legislatures.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/senate-filibuster-trump-republicans","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:59:00-04:00","title":"Republican Leaders Reject Ending the Senate Filibuster Despite Trump’s Call to Nuke It","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Republican leaders in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, have rejected President Donald Trump’s call to end the Senate filibuster, despite the government shutdown.

Republican leaders reject ending the Senate filibuster despite Trump’s call to nuke it \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:59 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The top two Republicans in Congress are showing no interest in taking the unprecedented step of ending the legislative filibuster, just hours after President Donald Trump  made a fresh demand  for the Senate to do so to end the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In perhaps the clearest possible signal to the White House that Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not change Senate rules to end the already 31-day stalemate, a spokesman said the Republican leader remained unmoved.\n \n\n   \n  “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesperson Ryan Wrasse told CNN, reiterating the long-time view of Thune and many others in Senate leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Even House Speaker Mike Johnson — who rarely breaks with Trump in public — offered a cautious warning about keeping the filibuster intact.\n \n\n   \n  “The filibuster has traditionally been used as a very important safeguard,” Johnson said, noting that his own opinion is “not relevant” given it is a Senate-only issue. But the GOP speaker warned that Democrats would use the move to pass extreme measures the next time they control the upper chamber.\n \n\n   \n  “They would pack the Supreme Court, they would make Puerto Rico and DC states. They would ban firearms. They would do all sorts of things that would be very harmful to the country,” Johnson said, stressing that Trump’s late-night Truth Social post on the filibuster was an “expression of the president’s anger at this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  The rare split between congressional Republicans and the White House comes as the Washington stalemate and the pains of the shutdown around the country have deepened in recent days. But the GOP leaders’ swift move to quash Trump’s suggestion on the filibuster is a reflection of a clear political reality on Capitol Hill: There is little support for such a move within the Senate GOP conference.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Taking the so-called nuclear option would require near-unanimity, since Thune and Senate GOP leaders could only lose three votes from their own party to do so if all Democrats oppose the move. And the number of GOP senators currently opposed stands far higher than that, with at least a dozen Republicans on the record against it.\n \n\n   \n  Still, deploying the “nuclear option” would not entirely end the Senate’s filibuster. Instead, it would eliminate the 60-vote threshold to end debate, instead requiring 51 votes.\n \n\n   \n  One of those lawmakers, freshman Sen. John Curtis of Utah, made clear Friday morning that he remained opposed despite Trump’s urging.\n \n\n   \n  “The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it,” Curtis wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Several GOP senators have echoed that sentiment in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through any rules change.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Roger Marshall called the idea a “non-starter” earlier this month, saying that “a republic protects the rights of the minority. Otherwise you just take a poll and you switch the direction the ship is going. So that filibuster helps protect the minority, and I think it’s served our country well.”\n \n\n   \n  Also earlier in the month, Thune himself ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end it.\n \n\n   \n  His team’s Friday statement reaffirming the leader’s opposition had some Senate Republicans breathing a sigh of relief, according to one GOP senate staffer.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” the GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/media/gayle-king-cbs-news-bari-weiss-ellison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:54:00-04:00","title":"CBS News Roiled by Rumors, with Gayle King’s Future the Latest Flashpoint","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CBS News is facing a wave of speculation and internal instability following David Ellison’s recent takeover of Paramount and the appointment of Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief.

But each story adds to the uncertainty and unease in the air. The latest one is about Gayle King, with Variety  reporting  that she is “expected to depart” her longtime TV home, “CBS Mornings,” next year.\n \n\n   \n  If that’s the case, it would be news to King, whose contract doesn’t expire for another six months. She  told TMZ on Friday  morning: “All I’ve been told by everybody in this building is that they want me here, they like the job I’ve been doing… What I’m hearing in the building is not what I’m reading in the press.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the CBS News management team is in whack-a-mole mode, trying to tamp down the speculation — and probably trying to avoid any potential blowback from viewers.\n \n\n   \n  All the instability stems from David Ellison’s recent takeover of Paramount and  his decision to appoint  Bari Weiss as the editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, the entrepreneurial and opinionated co-founder of The Free Press website, is an irresistible story to the media chattering classes. People both inside and outside CBS are desperate to know what she’s going to change at the storied news division.\n \n\n   \n  Weiss, who has been on the job for just a few weeks, has been frustrated about the leaks relating to her arrival, according to a recent  New York Times report .\n \n\n   \n  She certainly deserves time and space to get to know CBS News and think through potential changes. But just this week, there have been stories about who Weiss may or may not want to keep at “60 Minutes;” who she may or may not want to hire for the “CBS Evening News;” and now, what might happen to the morning show.\n \n\n   \n  “You know the old adage: Nobody knows anything,” a CBS source remarked, pointing out that all the speculation is destabilizing in the meantime.\n \n\n   \n  The news division also  laid off about one hundred people  earlier this week, though the cuts were foreshadowed months ago, well before Weiss was hired.\n \n\n   \n    The morning show intrigue\n \n\n   \n  The CBS weekday morning show has undergone multiple permutations over the past decade, and King has been the central player throughout, helming the show while other co-hosts have come and gone.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, Variety reporters Matt Donnelly and Brian Steinberg wrote that King is “expected to depart” the show and “may shift to a different role at the news division,” potentially with “a deal to produce her own programming for the network.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair also wrote that “negotiations are about to ensue,” which left some CBS staffers wondering: Is someone prematurely leaking that King is departing, and if so, why? Or is King privately telling people that she wants out, no matter what CBS offers?\n \n\n   \n  All the broadcast networks have been trying to lower salary costs in recent years, so there is little doubt that CBS would want King to accept a pay cut to stay at the network in any capacity.\n \n\n   \n  CBS responded forcefully to the Variety article, saying, “There have been no discussions with Gayle about her contract that runs through May 2026.” (And King told TMZ on Friday, “I am not going to negotiate in the media.”)\n \n\n   \n  It is highly unusual for a network to say when a star’s contract is up, but it showed that the typical window for negotiations hasn’t even opened yet.\n \n\n   \n  As Variety noted, “Moving King is a risky maneuver, especially because morning-TV is built on the relationships viewers build with the hosts.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s likely why CBS said in its statement that King is “a truly valued part of CBS and we look forward to engaging with her about the future.”\n \n\n   \n  Her co-host on the morning show, Nate Burleson, also commented personally on Instagram, reflecting how the uncertainty is weighing on staffers at the network.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope this rumor doesn’t hold up,” he wrote, calling King “a fixture, a force, and a part of the fabric of ‘CBS Mornings.’”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/pentagon-tomahawks-trump-ukraine","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"Pentagon Cleared Giving Ukraine Long-Range Tomahawk Missiles, Leaving Final Decision to Trump","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon has approved the White House to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, assessing no negative impact on U.S. stockpiles, but the final decision rests with President Donald Trump.

\n        1:00 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon has given the White House the green light to provide Ukraine with  long-range Tomahawk missiles  after assessing that it would not negatively impact US stockpiles, leaving the final political decision in President  Donald Trump’s  hands, according to three US and European officials familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said earlier this month during a working lunch with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House that he would rather not provide the missiles to Ukraine because “we don’t want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country.”\n \n\n   \n  The Joint Staff informed the White House of its assessment earlier this month, just before Trump met with Zelensky   who has been pushing for the missiles to more effectively target oil and energy facilities deep inside Russia. Tomahawks have a range of around 1,000 miles.\n \n\n   \n  The assessment buoyed the US’ European allies, who believ e  that the US now ha s  fewer excuses not to provide the missiles, two European officials said. Trump also said just days before meeting Zelensky that the US has “a lot of Tomahawks” that it could potentially give to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  US and European officials were surprised, therefore, when Trump dramatically changed his tune days later, saying during opening remarks at a White House working lunch with Zelensky that the US “needs” the Tomahawks.   He then told Zelensky behind closed doors that the US would not be providing them — at least not yet.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s decision came one day after he spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who told Trump that Tomahawks could hit major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield but would damage the US-Russia relationship, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The White House and Pentagon did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not taken the missiles off the table altogether, sources previously told CNN, and the administration has drawn up plans to provide them to Ukraine quickly should Trump give the order. Trump has also grown so frustrated in recent weeks with Putin’s unwillingness to seriously consider peace talks that he approved new US sanctions on Russian oil firms last week and scrapped — for now — a planned meeting with Putin in Budapest to discuss Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  While the Pentagon doesn’t have concerns about stockpiles, US defense officials are still grappling with how Ukraine would train on and deploy the missiles, officials said. There are still several operational issues that would need to be resolved for Ukraine to be able to use the missiles effectively, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  One outstanding question is how Ukraine would fire the missiles if the US provided them. Tomahawks are most commonly launched from surface ships or submarines, but Ukraine’s Navy is severely depleted ,  so the missiles would likely need to be launched on land. The Marine Corps and Army have developed ground-based launchers that could be provided to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  But even if the US did not want to provide the launchers, European officials believe Ukraine could figure out a workaround. One official pointed out that Ukrainian engineers were able to develop a workaround to use the UK-provided Storm Shadow missiles, which were originally designed to be used by modern NATO aircraft and had to be integrated into Ukraine’s aging, Soviet-era fighter jet fleet.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on X earlier this week, Zelenksy said Ukraine hopes to expand its long-range capabilities by the end of this year so the war can end “on fair terms” for the country.\n \n\n   \n  “Global sanctions and our pinpoint precision are practically syncing up to end this war on terms fair for Ukraine,” he wrote. “All deep-strike goals must be fully locked in by year’s end, including expansion of our long-range footprint.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/jetblue-flight-emergency-landing-florida","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"14:02:00Z","title":"At least 15 people sent to hospital after JetBlue flight drops altitude, forcing emergency landing in Florida, officials say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A JetBlue flight (Flight 1230) en route from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced a sudden 100-foot drop in altitude within seven seconds, prompting an emergency landing at Tampa International Airport.

a sudden drop in altitude on a JetBlue flight that forced an emergency landing in Tampa, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Flight 1230 was heading Thursday from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, when it “experienced a drop in altitude,” JetBlue said in a statement, causing pilots to call for medical help. The plane diverted to Tampa International Airport around 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Aviation Administration said.\n \n\n   \n  The plane dropped about 100 feet in about seven seconds around 1:48 p.m. before making a more normal descent into Tampa, data from  FlightRadar24  shows. Medical personnel were there to meet the plane on arrival, an airport spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA is investigating a “flight control issue” on the Airbus A320, it said, echoing a pilot’s message to air traffic controllers around the time of the brief descent. The National Transportation Safety Board is aware of the incident but has not started an investigation, the agency told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The flight disruption comes in a  volatile year  for air travel, with a major  midair collision ,  runway incursions  and  serious turbulence  already in play before the monthlong  government shutdown  raised staffing issues for  air traffic controllers  as the  holiday travel season  looms.\n \n\n   \n  Just before Thursday’s emergency, a strong cold front passed through Florida, leaving gusty winds and light rain showers.

The NTSB investigated that incident.\n \n\n   \n  As air traffic controllers on Thursday guided the JetBlue flight into Tampa, pilots reported injuries, including a possible “laceration in the head,” the audio indicates.\n \n\n   \n  Some 15 to 20 people aboard the plane were evaluated and taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Tampa Fire Rescue spokesperson Vivian Shedd said.\n \n\n   \n  Two children and 12 adults were taken to Tampa’s St. Joseph’s Hospital with minor injuries, and all have been discharged, a hospital spokesperson said.

Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After the government had been shut down for nearly a month, a conspicuously quiet  President Donald Trump  finally weighed in with a prescription for how to end it.\n \n\n   \n  Republican congressional leaders are probably wishing he hadn’t.\n \n\n   \n  Trump late Thursday night urged Republicans to end the shutdown by  invoking the so-called “nuclear option”  — that is, getting rid of the filibuster and 60-vote threshold in the Senate. This would allow Republicans to pass things on party-line votes in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE STONE COLD ‘CRAZY,’ THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  That Trump would call for this is not terribly surprising; he has spent years occasionally urging Republican leaders to scrap the filibuster. Nor is it particularly likely to provide an actual offramp in the shutdown; those same GOP leaders have steadfastly declined Trump’s entreaties before and rejected this idea repeatedly in recent weeks. It’s not even clear whether enough senators would vote for such a change if GOP leaders went along with it.\n \n\n   \n  So practically speaking, it’s a pointless interjection from the president.\n \n\n   \n  But it does matter in one way: It’s Trump yet again inserting himself into these kinds of talks in ways that are thoroughly unhelpful to his party. And this has become a trend.\n \n\n   \n  The reason it’s unhelpful in this case is that it legitimizes Democrats’ talking point that Republicans could end this shutdown any time they want to. And that could make it harder for Republicans to shake the blame they’ve been saddled with.\n \n\n   \n  It’s been pretty remarkable how much Americans have  continued to blame Republicans  more than Democrats for the shutdown, despite it being Democrats who are seeking the concession (i.e. an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies). A  Washington Post-ABC News poll  released Thursday showed 45% of Americans mainly blamed Trump and the GOP, versus 33% who held Democrats responsible.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, the idea that Republicans could end the shutdown anytime they want is a vastly oversimplified talking point. Yes, all they need is a majority of the Senate to nuke the filibuster. But there are myriad reasons to avoid invoking that nuclear option. And Republican leaders have pointed to them for weeks — specifically invoking what they fear Democrats could do without that 60-vote threshold if they regain control of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month called the filibuster “a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening to the country.” (His spokesperson on Friday said the leader’s position is “unchanged.”) Fellow Senate GOP leader John Barrasso of Wyoming argued that nixing the filibuster would ultimately allow Democrats to make Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia into states, with two senators apiece, and to pack the Supreme Court. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would mean there would be “no stumbling blocks or hurdles at all in the way of turning us into a communist country.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump is now legitimizing blaming his own party for the shutdown because they won’t have done the thing he told them to do.\n \n\n   \n  And if you’re a Republican in Congress, you’ve probably got déjà vu about now. That’s because Trump does stuff like this a lot – especially during shutdown debates.\n \n\n   \n  In early 2018, Trump  contradicted his own spokeswoman’s statement  of support for a short-term continuing resolution, making a late demand to scrap an extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program.\n \n\n   \n  Trump then pulled another  11th-hour shift a few weeks later , demanding immigration concessions that hadn’t previously been a focal point of leaders’ efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Before he was sworn in to his second term in January, Trump and Elon Musk combined in December to play the role of legislative arsonists again. GOP leaders had negotiated a bipartisan deal to avert a shutdown. But then Musk started waging war against it on X. Trump then joined him and  threw another wrench in the cogs , suddenly demanding a debt ceiling increase that hadn’t really been a part of discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has regularly given congressional Republicans fits in these situations – so much so that they’ll occasionally acknowledge their frustrations publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in early 2018  practically pleaded with Trump  to engage in the process and provide some direction. “As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels,” the Kentucky Republican said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump threw a late grenade in the process in December, Sen. Kevin Cramer said he was “very frustrated.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN’s Manu Raju asked the North Dakota Republican if he wished Trump had signaled his demands earlier, Cramer  responded dryly : “Yeah, I mean, maybe he hadn’t thought about it until just today. But yeah, that would have been very helpful.”\n \n\n   \n  None of this means Trump’s late entry into this shutdown debate is a game-changer. Perhaps GOP leaders will get through to Trump that this strategy isn’t particularly helpful – as they appear to have with other Republicans who occasionally suggested this route – and he’ll drop it.\n \n\n   \n  But his late-night social media demand has at the very least put Republicans in the uncomfortable position of explaining why they don’t attempt to do the thing that is technically in their power to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  And we’re already seeing Republicans try and massage this issue away.\n \n\n   \n  “What you’re seeing is an expression of the president’s anger at the situation,” Johnson said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps, but most presidents don’t lash out and kneecap their side’s negotiating power just because they get frustrated.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/prince-andrew-title-and-honors-remove-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:27:00-04:00","title":"King Charles strips his brother Andrew of ‘prince’ title and evicts him from royal mansion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles has taken decisive action to strip Prince Andrew of his royal titles and evict him from Royal Lodge in Windsor, citing serious lapses in judgment linked to his connections with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations of sexual misconduct.

The question now: whether King Charles and the British establishment have done enough to prevent Andrew’s association with  Epstein  from engulfing the monarchy.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre – who the prince claims never to have met – died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in a statement on Thursday: “Today, an ordinary American girl, from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.”\n \n\n   \n  Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, told CNN that it had been a “joyous and happy and sad day.”\n \n\n   \n  In the statement, Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew would be forced out of his residence and take the family name. “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His  lease on Royal Lodge  has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, about 100 miles north of London, which is privately owned by the British monarch. Royal Lodge sits within Windsor Great Park, part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state. Andrew’s new accommodation will be privately funded by King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  It’s understood the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is not expected to move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, according to a royal source.\n \n\n   \n  Moving in the new year might also avoid potential awkwardness over the holidays as Sandringham is traditionally where the royal family gathers for the festive season. It was previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from Christmas celebrations.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had sought to end the renewed scrutiny of his conduct by relinquishing  use of his titles  earlier this month. But his moves did little to stem the flow of negative headlines and sparked fresh questions about how he was able to pay Giuffre a reportedly multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil case in 2022 and fund his lifestyle despite having not been a working royal since 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Public anger has also grown after it emerged last week that he paid $1 million for Royal Lodge, in the heart of Windsor Great Park near Windsor Castle, in 2003, and only a peppercorn rent “if demanded” each year since then, according to his lease agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Thursday’s announcement, Andrew remains eighth in line to the British throne. That status  could be removed  by legislation, but it would require the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world, which would take time. The last time this protocol was used was when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that rather than formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York via an act of parliament, King Charles will send royal warrants to remove Andrew’s peerages.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The stripping of his titles takes immediate effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  In his interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Sky Roberts said King Charles’ decision vindicated the years of campaigning by his sister. “She should be here. She should be having this interview with you,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had been fighting for this for a long time. She always said… only one of us is telling the truth and I know that’s me,” Roberts said. “We’re really proud of her. We’re so proud of what she was able to achieve.”\n \n\n   \n  Calling it a “huge moment” for his sister and other survivors, Roberts said: “It’s an acknowledgement to say, we believe you. We see you. And for me, I love you. We love you… This is a very vindicating moment for us. And I just wish she was here to to share this with us.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in their statement they would fight to ensure other associates of Epstein would face similar judgement. “Our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory,” the statement said, adding they will “not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”\n \n\n   \n    Calls for Andrew to face justice continue\n \n\n   \n  The anti-monarchy group Republic said Thursday that it had instructed lawyers to launch a private prosecution against Andrew “over accusations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.”\n \n\n   \n  The group said its lawyers would be actively investigating the case against Andrew and aim to begin proceedings in the coming weeks. Republic has previously called for the police to investigate Andrew.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be very clear, Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatton Windsor – is not facing justice. He’s not being held to account. Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said Thursday following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the British monarch was  heckled by a protester  who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.\n \n\n   \n    Andrew’s daughters to retain princess titles\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign – in line with rules set out by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lived with him for the past 20 years at Royal Lodge, will also move out and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Ferguson, 66, is the mother of Andrew’s two children. They wed in 1986 and divorced a decade later. She previously held the title of Duchess of York, but reverted to her maiden name when Andrew relinquished his titles earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also understands that the British government was consulted on the King’s decisions, and the government has made it clear that it supports the moves.\n \n\n   \n  The last time a prince had his title removed is understood to be more than 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. The action was taken after he fought in World War I for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s MiSeon Lee contributed to this report.

brother. Is it too little too late? \n       \n  Analysis by Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:30 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  King Charles’  decision  to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy as well as the  30-room mansion  where he’s lived for more than 20 years was as sudden as it was dramatic.\n \n\n   \n  It is the ultimate humiliation for the 65-year-old now-former prince,  known to enjoy the trappings and privilege of royal life. He will move out of Royal Lodge, his sprawling mansion in the heart of the Windsor estate just outside of London, and be exiled to the countryside to live in obscurity.\n \n\n   \n  The monarchy had been under intense pressure to resolve the Andrew issue amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which was further inflamed by the release of his sexual abuse accuser  Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.  Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks ago, Andrew  gave up the use  of his titles and honors, more than five years after  stepping back as a frontline royal . He said he was putting “duty to my family and country first,” but it did little to stop the snowballing scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Thursday evening, a brusque bombshell announcement from Buckingham Palace: Andrew is to lose his princely status, and effective immediately he is plain old Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, a commoner.\n \n\n   \n  The palace statement was clear – the decision was the king’s and Andrew had no choice in the matter (although he is understood not to have objected to his brother’s actions). Notable in the statement too, an expression of solidarity with victims of abuse.\n \n\n   \n  The significance of Charles’ moves on Thursday cannot be overstated. ﻿Not since the abdication crisis of 1936 has there been such a public casting aside of a senior British royal.\n \n\n   \n  The decision would doubtless have been difficult – and, given the personal family dynamics at play, deeply personal. But the monarch had no choice – Andrew’s controversies have been dogging the family for years and the publication of his accuser’s posthumous memoir was the final straw. The negotiations to get to this stage will have been challenging but the monarch had no option but to engage damage control mode.\n \n\n   \n  It was not just the public that had expressed outrage and frustration; there had also been increasing calls for Andrew to appear before a parliamentary committee. Perhaps this move will head off that particular indignity.\n \n\n   \n  Royal historian Kate Williams said the King’s decision was “unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a huge move from the royal family. Just recently, the King announced that Andrew was stepping back from the title Duke of York just a few days before Ms. Giuffre’s memoir was published. But that simply wasn’t enough for public opinion,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We have had people in the past losing the title of prince or princess. Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) said his daughters were no longer legitimate after he annulled the marriages with their mothers, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn – but he changed his mind later.”\n \n\n   \n  She also pointed out Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – whose title of the Duke of Albany was removed by parliament in 1917 after he fought for Germany in World War I. But Andrew’s situation, Williams said, was different as he was censured because of his serious errors of judgment.\n \n\n   \n  The King’s moves were welcomed by many British politicians. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that “the King has clearly felt that this is the right decision for the royal family” but added that it “must have been a very difficult thing” to act against his own sibling.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats said Andrew’s situation “had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”\n \n\n   \n  For several weeks, it has felt like some sort of announcement was coming down the pike and was simply a case of when, rather than if.\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources told CNN that the King was trying to act swiftly following recent developments but had needed some time to consult legal and constitutional experts.\n \n\n   \n  It is also understood that the King took action in light of his sibling’s serious lapses of judgment and has the support of the wider family, including Prince William.\n \n\n   \n  The statement, when it came, was uncompromising. “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  For many people in the country, and certainly critics of the royal family, these moves might not be enough to rehabilitate the monarchy’s tarnished reputation. For some, the removal of Andrew’s status as prince only goes so far. Other critics say the family has shielded Andrew over the years, and pressure for some sort of accountability needs to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite being stripped of his prince title, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. Royal sources have told CNN that he will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, and will receive an income from Charles as well.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew is not expected to move from his Windsor mansion to Sandringham in Norfolk until after the Christmas holidays, according to a royal source. The move will happen as soon as possible and practical, but the process of giving notice, surrendering the lease and other practicalities of the relocation can be a drawn-out process.\n \n\n   \n  Moving in the new year might also avoid potential awkwardness over the holidays as Sandringham is traditionally where the royal family gathers for the festive season. It was previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from Christmas celebrations with the rest of the Windsor clan.\n \n\n   \n  His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has been living with Andrew at Royal Lodge for the last two decades, is moving out as well and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Their two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear if the King’s actions will be enough to give a public perception that the situation has been handled, but Charles seems to be doing as much as he feels he can within his own royal prerogative.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/andrew-mountbatten-windsor-what-next-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:26:00-04:00","title":"Prince No Longer: What Next for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, has been stripped of all royal titles and honors by King Charles III as part of a process initiated over allegations of ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and sexual misconduct involving Virginia Giuffre.

Mountbatten Windsor? \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:26 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A fortnight ago, he was  Prince Andrew , Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.\n \n\n   \n  Now, he is simply Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, Buckingham Palace announced that  King Charles III  had started a process to strip his brother of his titles and honors and evict him from the royal estate at Windsor, capping Andrew’s fall from grace over his ties to the convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. By the next morning, Andrew’s name had already been removed from the official role of the peerage – a crucial step in the formal scrapping of his titles.\n \n\n   \n  While the royal family hopes this move can draw a line under this years-long scandal,  questions  are swirling about where Andrew, 65, will live, whether he could yet face more legal troubles and whether his banishment will appease the British public. Here, we answer some of those.\n \n\n   \n    Where will Andrew sleep tonight?\n \n\n   \n  Most likely in  Royal Lodge , the grand 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park, west of London, which has been Andrew’s home since 2003. The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, and his 75-year lease was due to expire in 2078.\n \n\n   \n  But in its Thursday night statement, Buckingham Palace said Andrew had been served formal notice to surrender his lease and that he would “move to alternative private accommodation.” It is understood that he will move as soon as is practicable.\n \n\n   \n    Where will he live in the future?\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources have told CNN that Andrew will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. That vast estate on England’s eastern coast is home to some 150 properties.\n \n\n   \n  It is also where the royal family spends Christmas. Before the Thursday night announcement, Andrew had already been told he would not be welcome at the country retreat over the holidays, a royal source had said.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew might not move to Sandringham until after the Christmas holidays, another source said, because giving notice, surrendering the lease and orchestrating the move is expected to take some time.\n \n\n   \n    Will he receive an income?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, but we don’t know how much. After he stepped back from public duties following his disastrous 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Andrew was thought to receive an annual allowance of about £1 million ($1.3 million) from the late Queen, according to British media reports.\n \n\n   \n  Those payments initially continued under Charles, the reports said, but it is understood that the King had stopped providing the allowance.\n \n\n   \n  Despite now being stripped of his prince title, CNN understands that Andrew will still receive an income from Charles.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s finances have always been something of a mystery. His only source of income that has been declared is the pension he receives from his time in the navy between 1979 and 2001, said to amount to £20,000 ($26,000) a year.\n \n\n   \n    Is he still in the line of succession?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew may have lost his titles, status and honors but he is still eighth in line to the British throne.\n \n\n   \n  There is a process to formally remove him from the line of succession by legislation, but it would take time as it requires the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world.\n \n\n   \n  The last time this protocol was invoked was in 1936 with the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n    What will happen to his family?\n \n\n   \n  Andrew and Sarah Ferguson divorced in 1996 but have lived together at Royal Lodge in Windsor since 2008. His ex-wife reverted to her maiden name earlier this month when Andrew relinquished the use of his royal titles, including Duke of York. She is also moving out of Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements. It is understood that she will not be joining Andrew when he moves to Sandringham.\n \n\n   \n  Their daughters, Princess Beatrice, 37, and Princess Eugenie, 35, are non-working royals and will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Beatrice lives with her husband in the Cotswolds, about 100 miles from London, but has an apartment at St. James’s Palace in the capital. Eugenie and her husband have a cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace but spend a lot of time abroad. Their living situations will not be affected by their father’s exile.\n \n\n   \n    Could he be hauled in front of parliament?\n \n\n   \n  The Liberal Democrats, an opposition party, have lately called for Andrew to give evidence to a parliamentary committee about his finances and potential rent paid to live in Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to give members of parliament time to debate Andrew’s finances, despite public outcry for proper scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  This week, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative lawmaker and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, wrote to the Crown Estate Commissioners seeking more information on Andrew’s lease arrangements for Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  That committee is responsible for “upholding best value for taxpayers’ money,” Clifton-Brown wrote, and as such “we feel it is reasonable to seek further information on the status of, and rationale for, the lease of Royal Lodge.”\n \n\n   \n    Might he face further legal challenges?\n \n\n   \n  Potentially. Republic, an activist group seeking to abolish the monarchy, says it is pursuing a private prosecution of Andrew “because if the government and police won’t hold him to account, we will.”\n \n\n   \n  The group says it has instructed lawyers to investigate and, if appropriate, begin a private prosecution over allegations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.\n \n\n   \n   Virginia Giuffre , a prominent accuser of Epstein and his circle, alleged that Andrew had sex with her three times when she was a teenager. In her recent memoir, published posthumously, Giuffre wrote that Andrew “believed that having sex with me was his birthright.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite claiming never to have met her, Andrew reportedly paid millions of dollars to Giuffre in 2022 to settle a civil case she brought against him. He has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre died by suicide in April. On Thursday, Sky and Amanda Roberts, Giuffre’s brother and sister-in-law, told CNN that Giuffre would have been “joyous” to know that Andrew had been stripped of the title that helped shield him from accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “I think she would be proud, and I think she would turn to her children and say, ‘I did it. I got the bad guy,’” said Amanda Roberts.\n \n\n   \n    Will this be enough for the British public?\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to say. Andrew is deeply unpopular with the British public. In a poll published Thursday by YouGov, 91% of Britons had a negative opinion of Andrew. Just 4% had a positive one. By contrast, Britons generally like Prince William (76%) and Charles (62%), and overall have a positive view of the monarchy as an institution (56%).\n \n\n   \n  If Andrew’s fall from grace began in earnest after his 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, the royal family have repeatedly tried to draw a line under the scandal – first by Andrew’s withdrawing from public life, then by removing his military titles and patronages, later cutting him off financially, then by his relinquishing some of his titles – and now by the King casting him out of the palace for good as a pariah.\n \n\n   \n  None of the measures have quelled the public outcry. It remains to be seen whether this time will be different.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the Andrew scandal has roiled on for so long because, for the public, his “punishments” do not seem proportionate to the allegations that he faces. While the loss of his titles and favored residence may be a personal tragedy for Andrew, it elicits little sympathy from a public demanding proper accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t matter if he’s Prince Andrew or Andrew Mountbatten Windsor – we’re still pursuing a private prosecution of him,” said Republic, the activist group.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-senate-filibuster-nuclear-option-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:53:00-04:00","title":"Trump Calls for End of Senate Filibuster to Break Funding Stalemate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has urged Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Senate filibuster to end a prolonged government shutdown, calling it an urgent 'TRUMP CARD' move.

Trump calls for end of Senate filibuster to break funding stalemate \n       \n  By Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:53 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President  Donald Trump  on Thursday urged congressional Republicans to unilaterally end  the government shutdown  by eliminating the Senate filibuster — urging them to take an unprecedented step that GOP leaders have firmly opposed until now.\n \n\n   \n  “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote in a  Truth Social post .\n \n\n   \n  The directive — which came after Trump returned from several days abroad — is likely to upend efforts on Capitol Hill to bring an end to the weekslong funding impasse. And it immediately ratcheted up the pressure on Republican leaders, who have adamantly opposed eliminating the  60-vote threshold for passing legislation  as a way to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Top GOP lawmakers have long argued for keeping that threshold in place, asserting that the filibuster benefits Republicans — and will serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.” At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said in a statement to CNN Friday, “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.” The statement had some in his party breathing a sigh of relief.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely gives us cover,” a GOP aide told CNN. “No one in the conference seriously wants to nuke the filibuster except maybe two.”\n \n\n   \n  Several GOP senators have echoed Thune’s sentiment in recent days in a sign that Trump could face a steep battle with his own party to push through the rules change. Killing the filibuster would take a majority vote in the Senate, meaning Republicans could only lose three lawmakers assuming all Democrats oppose the move.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday morning, Sen. John Curtis of Utah  posted on X  that he remained a “firm no” on eliminating the filibuster, writing that “the filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate. Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump on Thursday appeared to dismiss those concerns, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government. The president made a similar case during his first term, though Senate Republicans never acted on it at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the  longest-ever government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n   Critical food aid  for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend. The White House on Thursday also sought to highlight the stress that the shutdown is putting on air traffic controllers by convening a roundtable of airline industry representatives and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n   This story  has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/sport/tennis-joao-fonseca-profile-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"14:34:00Z","title":"Teenage tennis star and ‘generational talent’ João Fonseca tempering power with patience as he ascends the sport","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"João Fonseca, a 19-year-old Brazilian tennis prodigy, has emerged as a rising force in men’s tennis thanks to his explosive forehand and consistent performances, including two ATP Tour titles this year, with a major win in Basel.

talent’ João Fonseca tempering power with patience as he ascends the sport \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:34 PM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ever since he first picked up a  tennis  racket,  João Fonseca  has shown a penchant for power – even if it came with mixed results.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the kind of kid that destroyed the ball,” says Fonseca. “Sometimes, it would go into the fence; sometimes, it would go straight to the floor; and then, sometimes, we’re doing a winner.”\n \n\n   \n  That approach – fearless, furious and unrestrained – has stayed with the Brazilian into his professional career, and today, his ripping forehand is one of the most breathtaking sights in men’s tennis.\n \n\n   \n  Few players can match the 19-year-old Fonseca when it comes to  raw power , particularly on the forehand wing. This not-so-subtle, not-so-secret weapon has guided him to two ATP Tour titles this year, including in the Swiss city of Basel last week.\n \n\n   \n  There, Fonseca thumped 29 winners to see off Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the final, while his average forehand speed was clocked at 81 miles per hour. For comparison, top players  usually average  around 75.\n \n\n   \n  “I think my coach was really the first one that said: ‘Keep with this aggression,’” Fonseca tells  CNN Sports  about his all-out approach. “‘Keep doing this, but at the same time, let’s work with being more solid.’\n \n\n   \n  “During these last years, I understood that you can’t hit the ball hard every time … Sometimes, it’s a stupid idea, of course, but sometimes, it’s good to be aggressive, to be courageous and have confidence in your shots.”\n \n\n   \n  Lifting the title in Basel saw Fonseca become the third-youngest ATP 500 winner since the format was introduced in 2009, as well as the tournament’s youngest winner since Jim Courier in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  Still a teenager, Fonseca’s potential is huge, his freakish power likely to become more of a threat as he develops and refines his game. To some, he is destined to join  Carlos Alcaraz  and  Jannik Sinner  – by far and away the standout players in men’s tennis this year – at the very top of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “The Brazilian Blaster (Fonseca) is a generational talent as I said 2 years ago and will be right there someday with the Italian Flamethrower (Sinner) and Spanish Magician (Alcaraz),” Rick Macci, the former coach to Serena Williams,  wrote  on X recently.\n \n\n   \n  Those players, Macci added, will “create a new big three” to replace Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.\n \n\n   \n  Davidovich Fokina spoke along the same lines during his runner-up speech in Basel, telling Fonseca that he is “for sure going to be the next Nole (Djokovic) to beat Carlos and Jannik.”\n \n\n   \n  After winning last year’s Next Gen ATP Finals title – a tournament featuring the world’s best players under 20 – Fonseca turned heads at the Australian Open in January with a straight-sets victory over ninth seed Andrey Rublev.\n \n\n   \n  He followed that up by winning the Argentina Open a month later, becoming the second-youngest South American to win an ATP title in the Open Era.\n \n\n   \n  But Fonseca’s progress hasn’t been exponential. He failed to progress past the third round of a grand slam this year, perhaps a surprise after the enormous promise he showed at the start of the season.\n \n\n   \n  The victory in Basel, however, reaffirmed his status as one of the most explosive talents in the game, with Fonseca climbing 18 spots up the rankings to No. 28. That puts him well on track to fulfill his self-ascribed objectives for next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I think one of my goals is to be a seed, top 32 (at a grand slam),” says Fonseca. “It’s my personal goal. I’m working a lot to do it … let’s see how it goes.”\n \n\n   \n  To get to this level, Fonseca had to spend his formative years building a bond with tennis. As a young player, the game would make him feel restless, and he often found himself chasing big, haymaking shots on the court. He was even more impatient off it, unable to watch a full match without losing interest.\n \n\n   \n  That changed around 2019, when Fonseca sat absorbed as Novak Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in a  Wimbledon  final lasting four hours and 57 minutes – the longest final in the tournament’s history.\n \n\n   \n  A self-proclaimed Federer superfan, that match hurt Fonseca. As he started to enjoy tennis as a spectator, he would often watch the “Big 3” play out match after memorable match on the sport’s biggest stages, but it was the Swiss star who captivated him the most.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s my idol,” Fonseca confesses. Which goes some way to explaining why he suddenly found himself a sweaty, nervous wreck before meeting Federer for the first time in September.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a nice chat, about 10 minutes, and we talked a little bit about life, tour, how it is to live in Brazil and be far from home,” says Fonseca, adding: “He’s a super nice guy. You see these amazing players, these legends, as untouchable (and think): this guy is different. But no, he’s just a human being like us, super cool.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a very important moment; it’s going to be in my mind for my whole life.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s likely that the two might cross paths again, particularly given that Fonseca is sponsored by On – the sportswear company in which Federer has invested and helped with product development. The Brazilian was only 16 when he was signed by On and earmarked as a star in the making, joining a roster that includes six-time grand slam winner  Iga Świątek  and world No. 7  Ben Shelton .\n \n\n   \n  Several years earlier, Fonseca had made the decision to focus his sporting endeavors solely on tennis, not long after a  soccer  injury had left him sidelined for months.\n \n\n   \n  Like most kids growing up in Rio de Janeiro, soccer was, and still is, one of his great loves, even though his playing days have long since passed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a good level,” says Fonseca. “I’m a lefty leg, I had some skills, but nothing serious. I wouldn’t be professional or whatever. Fortunately, I stayed with tennis.”\n \n\n   \n  After reaching the quarterfinals of last year’s Rio Open aged 17, Fonseca decided to forego his college eligibility – he was holding a place at the University of Virginia – and turn professional.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, his march up the world rankings has been steady, quickly earning him an army of dedicated fans. Fonseca’s matches are some of the loudest on tour, and regardless of whether he’s playing in Brazil or further afield, yellow-and-green-clad spectators are guaranteed whenever he’s on a tennis court.\n \n\n   \n  It’s taken time, Fonseca admits, to grow accustomed to playing in front of such raucous crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “At the beginning, I was super nervous,” he says. “I needed to win, and there are people watching me, there are people cheering for me. The culture of Brazil is super loud, a lot of people supporting, I’ll say a little bit because of football.\n \n\n   \n  “I got used a lot to the crowd. Nowadays, I love playing with the crowd. I love them supporting me. I love that sometimes I’m in a bad situation in the match and they’re still supporting me, still cheering and motivating me.\n \n\n   \n  “I was more like a shy guy,” he adds, “and now I’m loving it.”\n \n\n   \n  Playing in loud matches at big tournaments is likely to be a mainstay of Fonseca’s career. He is slowly accumulating more experience against the world’s best players but hasn’t yet faced Djokovic – he’s hopeful of doing so before the Serb, now 38, retires – nor has he played either Alcaraz or Sinner.\n \n\n   \n  Those kinds of matches might become a regular occurrence should Fonseca, armed with that ferocious forehand, continue his march up the rankings. For now, he is watching closely as two players just a few years his senior rule over men’s tennis, sharing the past eight grand slams equally between them.\n \n\n   \n  One day, Fonseca might be in a position to challenge their duopoly.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’re doing is amazing,” he says of Alcaraz and Sinner. “They’re winning every tournament that they play.\n \n\n   \n  “They motivate all the other players to put more work in day by day, and try to be with them, try to win more tournaments, try to win matches, be more consistent. Hopefully, in the future, I will be with them, playing and competing in finals. But one step at a time, and let’s put in the work.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/weather/noaa-hurricane-hunters-shutdown-unpaid-melissa","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:54:00-04:00","title":"NOAA Hurricane Hunters Fly Into Storm Without Pay Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record with 185 mph winds, caused deadly damage in Jamaica, killing at least 19 people.

NOAA’s Hurricane Hunters flew into it without pay \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:54 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tossed and battered by violent wind and severe turbulence, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hurricane Hunters have spent the past week diving into the eye of  Melissa  —  a storm of historic ferocity  — to gather life-saving data. They have done it around the clock, 24/7, because their mission is considered essential to public safety.\n \n\n   \n  But this time, with the government shut down, they have done it all without pay.\n \n\n   \n  The Hurricane Hunters are a standard feature of US storm response. Information gathered by the planes’ specialized equipment, which includes a tail-mounted doppler radar that takes a virtual CT scan of the storm, are crucial for issuing accurate forecasts and gauging storm strength in real-time.\n \n\n   \n  The data, including the radar information, is fed straight into the computer models that forecasters use to predict a hurricane’s path and intensity.\n \n\n   \n  But as long-lived Hurricane Melissa rumbled on through the week, the people operating the flights have been under increasing financial stress.\n \n\n   \n  The crews of the agency’s decades-old WP-3D aircraft have now missed two paychecks due to the shutdown, according to a NOAA employee with knowledge of the hurricane hunter operations, who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n \n\n   \n  Crews are asked “To be fully mentally present, especially in this environment, and it’s hard to do that when you know you can’t potentially make ends meet,” the NOAA staff member said. “You’re dipping into savings to pay off your mortgage, you know, week to week or month to month.”\n \n\n   \n  The flights through the once Category 5 storm have been particularly hairy, with one of the NOAA aircraft having to return to its base for a safety inspection after exceeding its g-force limits from the turbulence.\n \n\n   \n  Videos during that flight show equipment falling from the ceiling of the plane, with roughly 20 crew members cursing and laughing as they are thrown against their safety harnesses.\n \n\n   \n  Following an inspection by ground crews, who are also working without pay, that same aircraft flew out later the same day on another mission into the storm, the NOAA staff member said.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA crews have met all the requests that the National Hurricane Center has made of them ,  the employee said. The Center assigns them to specific flight routes and schedules where scientists think in-situ data would improve the forecasts as much as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s just a notable thing that we have these crews going around the clock supporting the important mission that it is,” despite enduring increasing financial hardship, they said.\n \n\n   \n  They said the NOAA flights have been fully staffed with about 20 crew members per flight.\n \n\n   \n  The NOAA flights continued as the  storm plowed into Jamaica , doing immense damage to the island nation and killing at least 19 people.\n \n\n   \n  They have kept flying to support America’s international partners, with flights on Thursday aimed at making sure Bermuda residents get accurate warnings of the storm’s intensity and path.\n \n\n   \n  NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster acknowledged the crews’ hard work and their financial stress. “NOAA looks forward to a swift end to the crippling federal government shutdown which is forcing essential workers and service members like our brave Hurricane Hunter pilots to go unpaid as they perform their mission-critical duties that protect the lives of Americans every day,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Air Force Reserve also flies into hurricanes and has flown numerous missions into Melissa, but those planes are not bristling with the same specialized equipment that the older NOAA aircraft are. They fly a more straightforward reconnaissance mission, keeping tabs of the storm’s intensity and movement, whereas the NOAA flights are aimed more at hurricane research and enabling forecasting improvements.\n \n\n   \n  Remarkably, one of the Air Force flights also had to turn around after getting beaten up by severe turbulence flying through Melissa. CNN reached out to the Air Force’s Hurricane Hunter squadron to inquire about their pay status but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unusual for two flights to have to turn back within the same storm and indicates the hurricane’s power during its approach to southwestern Jamaica. Melissa crossed the Jamaican coast tied for the strongest-ever landfalling Atlantic hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.\n \n\n   \n  Andy Hazelton, a hurricane researcher who works with NOAA’s hurricane research division at the University of Miami, told CNN earlier this week that the NOAA flight that had to turn around due to turbulence was the roughest ride in a hurricane that he has had since he began such work seven years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “You hit a big enough updraft and downdraft you have to make sure the plane is ok,” Hazelton, who is being paid during the shutdown via the university, said. “These crews are doing this all while not getting paid, so they deserve all the credit.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/travel/the-worlds-best-hotels-for-2025-revealed","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"11:46:00-04:00","title":"The world’s best hotel for 2025 is a waterfront skyscraper","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rosewood Hong Kong has been named the world’s best hotel in 2025 by the 50 Best Hotels list, a global recognition based on evaluation by 800 hospitality experts.

Hardingham-Gill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:46 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s only been open for six years, but Rosewood Hong Kong has quickly become a distinguished feature of Hong Kong’s iconic skyline, as well as a force to be reckoned with in the luxury hotel scene.\n \n\n   \n  And after landing in the top three of the World’s 50 Best Hotels list twice, the 65-storey property came in  first place  this year.\n \n\n   \n  Designed by Taiwanese designer Tony Chi, the contemporary 413-room hotel beat out last year’s winner, Capella Bangkok, in the highly anticipated list from the global hospitality brand 50 Best, announced at an awards ceremony in London last night.\n \n\n   \n  Angus Pitkethley, complex director of sales and marketing for Rosewood Hong Kong, told the crowd at the Old Billingsgate events venue that it was a “real surprise and a real honor” to come out on top this year.\n \n\n   \n    World-class service\n \n\n   \n  “What an emotional night here in London…” Pitkethley added. “Just a huge amount of pride and gratitude to be recognized with this award.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked what he believed was the secret to the Rosewood Hong Kong’s success, Pitkethley credited the staff at the $650-a-night hotel, which is located on the Kowloon waterfront in Hong Kong.\n \n\n   \n  “We have an incredible team back at the hotel, who are not only passionate about hospitality, but really passionate about Hong Kong,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Describing this year’s list as “a true celebration of the very best properties from 22 destinations across six continents,” Emma Sleight, head of content for The World’s 50 Best Hotels, was full of praise for the Rosewood Hong Kong, which opened in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  “This exceptional hotel offers world-class service and sensational guest experiences in the heart of one of the world’s most bustling and dynamic destinations,” said Sleight.\n \n\n   \n  “Rosewood Hong Kong’s positioning as No.1 further consolidates Asia as a leading luxury travel destination for both business and leisure travelers.”\n \n\n   \n    Asia dominates\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Four Seasons Bangkok at Chao Phraya River, a 299-room retreat located in the center of the Thai capital’s creative district, came in second place, closely followed by Capella Bangkok, which took third place on the list, which was heavily dominated by Asian hotels.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Passalacqua, a boutique hotel located in Italy’s Lake Como was the only non-Asian hotel in the top five. The 18th-century villa took fourth place this year, making it the highest ranked European hotel, and was also named the Best Boutique Hotel.\n \n\n   \n  Historic hotel Raffles Singapore, the birthplace of the Singapore Sling cocktail, rounded out the top five.\n \n\n   \n  Other hotels in the Asian region featured on the list included Mandarin Oriental Bangkok (No.7), Upper House Hong Kong (No.10), Bulgari Tokyo (No.15), Aman Tokyo (No.25), Janu Tokyo (No.37), Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong (No.41), and The Tokyo Edition Toranomon (No.45).\n \n\n   \n    Very best properties\n \n\n   \n  The highest ranked hotel in North America was Chablé Yucatán (No. 8), one of four Mexican hotels featured. A former 19th-century hacienda, nestled in the Mayan jungle, Chablé Yucatán is “inspired by nature, culture, and human connection,” said Diego Gutiérrez, CEO of Chablé Hotels, in a press release. The Mark in New York was a new entry this year, placing at No.43 and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles ranked at No.42.\n \n\n   \n  Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, which also won the Lavazza Highest New Entry Award, and Rosewood São Paulo were the only South American hotels on the list, placing at No.11 and No.24 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Dubai’s Atlantis The Royal, No.6, was the highest ranked hotel in the Middle East, while Capella Sydney, No.12, beat out the competition for the Oceana region. At No.13, Marrakech’s Royal Mansour was the highest ranked hotel in Africa.\n \n\n   \n  The World’s Best Hotel list is decided by the World’s 50 Best Hotel Academy, which is made up of 800 hotel industry experts, including hoteliers and travel journalists, spread across 13 destinations around the globe.\n \n\n   \n    The World’s 50 Best Hotels 2025\n \n\n   \n  1.

And the government is more shut than ever.\n \n\n   \n  Washington woke Thursday to a whiff of rare hope that  behind-the-scenes efforts  were accelerating in the Senate to end a federal shutdown now imposing severe pain on millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  But the day ended with senators skipping town for the weekend — to join members of the House not seen inside the Beltway for so long it’s hard to remember what they look like.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made his first intervention in the shutdown drama since returning from a trip to Asia,  calling on Senate Republicans to end the filibuster  — the device that requires 60 votes to pass most major legislation and currently represents the only brake on his power that Democrats have in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Such a move would allow Republicans to open the government while bypassing Democratic demands. But it would open the possibility that Democrats could pass into law sweeping progressive reforms and roll back swaths of the conservative agenda if they control both chambers of Congress at some point in the future. Trump may not care what happens when he’s no longer president, but eliminating the filibuster would represent a fundamental political shift.\n \n\n   \n  This new wrinkle in Trump’s strategy will no doubt pile more pressure on Senate Majority Leader John Thune. And while Trump can shift his position from one moment to the next, his new gambit may indicate he’s more interested in crushing Democrats than seeking a way out of the increasingly damaging shutdown. Republican leaders in both parties have stated they don’t support ending the filibuster because of the implications for any future Democratic majority.\n \n\n   \n  What’s so galling in the current shutdown   is that both Republicans and Democrats insist they are keeping faith with their duties — taking care of the American people — but that the other side is willing to drive ordinary citizens to the brink of hunger or sickness.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown, refusing to extend federal funding until Republicans agree to extend expiring  enhanced Obamacare subsidies , without which millions of citizens will see  the cost of health care rocket .\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are willing to talk — but only when the government is opened again. Their assurances aren’t being taken at face value since their president routinely ignores the terms of deals and Congress’ constitutionally sound decisions on how to spend taxpayer money.\n \n\n   \n  The result:  Vital SNAP benefits  that help feed more than 40 million people are within hours of running out. Federal workers deemed essential have slogged through demoralizing weeks without pay. And it’s no vacation for their furloughed colleagues either: Financial obligations aren’t shut down just because the government is.\n \n\n   \n  Little is evident on the horizon that could prevent the monthlong shutdown from becoming the longest on record next week.\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of meaningful progress, dismayed lawmakers spent the day venting and trading insults.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accused Republicans of starving kids. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of putting extreme pressure  on air traffic controllers , implying they were risking the nation’s “extra safe” skies.\n \n\n   \n  Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said that staying in town for another weekend waiting for Democrats to come to the table “is gonna be a waste of time.” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, told CNN’s Dana Bash he was shocked “at the level of cruelty” shown by his GOP colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  And renegade Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has had it up to here with everyone. “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month,”  Fetterman told CNN . He also complained about his own party’s tactics. “We can’t even get our sh*t together and just open up our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    One judge says she won’t let people die\n \n\n   \n  Democrats might have some justification in arguing that Republicans and their health care policies and endless attempts to kill Obamacare set the stage for this crisis. But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.\n \n\n   \n  But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government. And any victory for either party at this point will be hollow, since it will be built on the suffering of citizens.\n \n\n   \n  One federal judge in Boston is doing what the judiciary often seems to do these days: stepping in where Congress has failed.  US District Judge Indira Talwani  signaled she will intervene in the dispute over the Trump administration’s refusal to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to fund food stamps under SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” Talwani said in the kind of plain English that lawmakers seem to shed when they get to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, Talwani said. “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger.\n \n\n   \n    Is there any hope for a breakthrough?\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes in Washington, the darkest hour is the one before dawn. So maybe there’s a chance the vicious rhetoric is a smokescreen allowing everyone to vent before they compromise.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s another characteristic of modern Washington that may be more apt right now — the way that disaster always has to nearly strike before two parties mired in their ideological extremes find a sliver of common ground.\n \n\n   \n  But at some point, this shutdown will end. It has to.\n \n\n   \n  If the denouement does not come from a president who discovers a moral or political imperative to live up to his 2016 convention vow, “I alone can fix it,” it may emerge from a creative fudge in the Senate in which Republicans give a handful of Democratic senators political cover to vote to break the filibuster and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Thune — who ditched his suave self-control on Wednesday to  rage at Democrats  in a Senate rant — struck one hopeful note when he said there was an uptick in bipartisan conversations this week. “We got members on both sides who are continuing to dialogue,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune doesn’t yet have the political space to offer Democrats the kind of tangible deliverables they would need. “When they’re willing to produce the votes to open up the government, we’re going to talk,” he said, restating the sticking point.\n \n\n   \n  One possible endgame scenario is that the Senate could blur the sequencing of when the government reopens and talks get serious on Obamacare subsidies. But knowing how something might eventually end is easier than getting there.\n \n\n   \n  Therefore, in the absence of progress, everyone had to fill the space.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now beginning Day 30 of the Democrat shutdown,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana. “There are millions of Americans … that are bracing themselves for further pain and hardship.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York accused the administration of enacting “policy violence” by refusing to extend Obamacare subsidies while offering a  $20 billion bailout  to Trump’s MAGA pal President Javier Milei in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said he wasn’t worried about his own air travel as air traffic control snarls, but did “worry about the flights of thousands and thousands of people.” Mixing transportation metaphors, he accused Democrats of being “way off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n  And Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York followed his warning on Wednesday that Trump “is a vindictive politician and a heartless politician and a heartless man” by accusing Republicans of bringing down “the specter of financial disaster” on Americans — including in red states — over health care.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not exactly promising.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune told reporters, “I’m always optimistic. Aren’t you?”\n \n\n   \n  That’s a tough one, senator.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting as well as to correct Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ state, Wyoming. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/tech/microsoft-amazon-meta-google-earnings-ai","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:05:00-04:00","title":"Big Tech Keeps Splurging on AI.

The pressure is ramping up to show why \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:05 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Silicon Valley’s mega AI spending spree isn’t slowing down anytime soon. But Wall Street’s patience to see a return might be wearing a little thin.\n \n\n   \n  That message rang clear when Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet all said this week that they’re forking over more   on capital expenditures, like   leases and equipment for data centers and infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Based on the way analysts grilled executives from companies like Meta, Alphabet and Google on earnings calls this week, they’re eager for signs that these massive investments will pay off in a big way.\n \n\n   \n    AI spending continues to soar\n \n\n   \n  Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all grew their overall revenue year-over-year and surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. Microsoft and Google saw their cloud businesses expand by 40% and 34% respectively, while Amazon Web Services sales grew 20% year-over-year – a sign that companies are indeed relying on their services in the age of AI.\n \n\n   \n  And they’re continuing to pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and data centers, an investment they call necessary for the internet’s next era.\n \n\n   \n  The dollar amounts involved are staggering.\n \n\n   \n  Google expects to   spend $91 to $93 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, up from the $85 billion it previously forecast. Microsoft sees that spending   up 74%, to $34.9 billion this year, largely lining up with the more than $30 billion it predicted for the quarter. Meta spent $19.37 billion, up from $9.2 billion a year ago and more than the $18.4 billion analysts expected.\n \n\n   \n  And Amazon estimates the 2025 bill will hit $125 billion – and   expects to increase that in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Even Apple, which is not a major cloud provider, expects to increase its capital expenditure spending related to AI investments, Apple Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said on the company’s Thursday earnings call.\n \n\n   \n  Existing data centers need to be upgraded to handle AI workloads, leading to the giant outlays, said Melissa Otto, head of research for investment research service S&P Global Visible Alpha.\n \n\n   \n  Tech giants justify that spending by saying demand is outstripping supply. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “as fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”\n \n\n   \n    Wall Street wants big answers from Big Tech\n \n\n   \n  But Wall Street wants more than just promises of future returns. Meta shares fell as much as 13.5% on Thursday, while Microsoft’s were down more than 3%.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly every question on Meta’s earnings call focused on how the company views its AI investments translating into income, the timeline for new products and models coming out of its Superintelligence Lab and its general approach to AI.\n \n\n   \n  Zuckerberg called AI useful for powering virtual assistants and helping advertisers plan their campaigns. More than a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis, he said, adding that AI can lead to “all kinds of new products around different content formats.”\n \n\n   \n  “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it,” he said about the Superintelligence Lab’s efforts.\n \n\n   \n  On the Microsoft call, analysts wanted to know if clients will make good on promised purchasing commitments and whether the tech industry can really make money from global AI investments. Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said its investments reflect business that’s already been booked, saying that demand is increasing.\n \n\n   \n  Google investors wanted to know how AI summaries and agents are changing how the company makes money from search. Google’s chief business officer said the company makes about the same money from ads   below and within the AI responses as with traditional search.\n \n\n   \n  The answers satisfied some analysts; UBS said it maintains its “conviction that AI-related stocks should drive further equity performance,” while CFRA Research said it came away from the quarter “more optimistic” about Google’s core business and that Meta “remains committed to becoming the leading AI lab.” Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives said Microsoft is “hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front.”\n \n\n   \n  But that’s as long as they keep growing the products that catapulted them to become the world’s largest tech companies in the first place. Investors are more likely to raise their eyebrows at all this spending if customers start shying away from Meta’s social media apps or Google’s search engine, according to Otto.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re seeing a pressure to accelerate innovation,” said SuRo Capital’s Evan Schlossman. “You have new space in AI that people believe will be extremely valuable, and so there is a rush to sort of fill that void.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/us-nuclear-testing-trump-advisers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:12:00-04:00","title":"Trump Announces Resumption of U.S. Nuclear Testing Ahead of China Summit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced, just before a scheduled summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, that the United States would resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing the growing nuclear capabilities of China and Russia.

would begin testing nukes. It caught even some advisers by surprise. \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:12 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Chinese leader Xi Jinping inserted a reference to “twists and turns” in his relationship with  President Donald Trump  in the opening remarks of their summit this week, he could hardly have imagined the twist that came minutes before the talks began.\n \n\n   \n  Writing from Marine One, which was gliding toward the airport in South Korea where he was due to meet Xi, Trump  instructed the Pentagon  to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing other nations’ — including China’s — own capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  “That process will begin immediately,” the president wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  The directive took even many of Trump’s advisers off guard, according to officials, leading to unanswered questions about when, or if, the testing would actually begin. Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.\n \n\n   \n  Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”\n \n\n   \n  “To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked by reporters in Malaysia on Friday about Trump’s post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon would move quickly and work with the Department of Energy. He argued that “resuming testing is a pretty responsible” way to keep a “credible nuclear deterrent.”\n \n\n   \n  Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n  A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”\n \n\n   \n  He seemed less cautious in his  Truth Social message  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.\n \n\n   \n  “With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”\n \n\n   \n  If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.\n \n\n   \n  “The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.\n \n\n   \n  In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.\n \n\n   \n  In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”\n \n\n   \n  “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.\n \n\n   \n  “If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/blood-pressure-medicine-recall-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:04:00-04:00","title":"FDA Recalls Blood Pressure Medication Prazosin Due to Possible Cancer-Causing Chemical","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has initiated a nationwide recall of over 580,000 bottles of prazosin hydrochloride capsules, manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA and distributed by Amerisource Health Services, due to the potential presence of n-nitrosamine impurities—known carcinogens that can form during drug manufacturing or storage.

\nUpdated: \n        10:40 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Protests are spreading in  Tanzania  as electoral authorities count the votes in a disputed presidential election that rights groups, opposition figures and others say was clouded by a climate of fear in the months leading to election day.\n \n\n   \n  The military has been deployed alongside the police to quell riots in major cities since Wednesday’s election. The sight of soldiers patrolling the streets, sporadic gunfire and closed stores is rare in the usually peaceful country that many foreigners visit for its pristine coastal beaches and safari tourism.\n \n\n   \n  That’s partly because Tanzania’s first female leader, who has served as president since 2021, has sparked widespread anger for  running virtually unopposed  after her two main opponents were blocked or prevented from contesting.\n \n\n   \n  President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who seeks five more years as president, ran against 16 candidates from smaller parties. Critics say that’s a coronation, not a contest. Hassan is now the subject of a range of uncharitable cartoons, posted on social media, derided as a dictator and lampooned as being afraid of competition.\n \n\n   \n  Tundu Lissu, leader of the Chadema opposition group, has been jailed for months, charged with treason after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from standing.\n \n\n   \n    Political maneuvering\n \n\n   \n  At stake for the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi party, or CCM, is its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hope to lead the country toward political change.\n \n\n   \n  The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, or ACLED, a nonprofit tracking violence and protest movements around the world, describes CCM as the “last of the hegemonic liberation parties,” trying to cling to power by blocking the opposition “through administrative, legal, and extra-legal means.”\n \n\n   \n  The pattern includes enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings, according to Amnesty International. In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited  more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019 , saying they were “alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression” ahead of elections.\n \n\n   \n  Internet access has been on and off since Wednesday as the nation awaits official results.\n \n\n   \n  Tanzania’s president has “overseen an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents,” the International Crisis Group said in its most recent analysis. “The government has curbed freedom of expression, ranging from a ban on X and restrictions on the Tanzanian digital platform JamiiForums to silencing critical voices through intimidation or arrest.”\n \n\n   \n  Local police even appeared to be “conducting so-called online patrols,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The political maneuvering by Tanzanian authorities is unprecedented even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multi-party politics in 1992.\n \n\n   \n  Government critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region.\n \n\n   \n  In Uganda, the opposition leader Bobi Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, is the leader of what began as the “People Power” movement, which aims for a break with nearly four decades of the same leader. President Yoweri Museveni took his lowest-ever share of the vote in the 2021 election, marking the 43-year-old Wine as a formidable national leader.\n \n\n   \n  In Kenya, young people have been trying to hold President William Ruto accountable over official corruption and his alleged failure to keep campaign promises. Last year and earlier this year, they held demonstrations in the capital Nairobi that were so large and persistent that Ruto deployed the military to restore order.\n \n\n   \n  In  Mozambique  a year ago, violence erupted in the streets after the opposition figure Venâncio Mondlane brought his supporters to the streets of the capital Maputo following a disputed election.\n \n\n   \n  In  Madagascar  earlier in October, protests by mostly young people helped overthrow the government of President Andry Rajoelina, who fled the country after an elite group of the military joined crowds protesting water and electricity cuts.\n \n\n   \n    Tanzania is an outlier\n \n\n   \n  But Tanzania is different, an outlier in the region.\n \n\n   \n  A version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since independence from Britain in 1961, a remarkable streak that Hassan is trying to extend as opposition leaders try to break CCM’s grip on the country.\n \n\n   \n  CCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or ten years. Hassan herself was able to rise to the presidency as vice president without incident when her predecessor, John Pombe Magufuli, died suddenly after the start of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  The orderly transition sustained Tanzania’s reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for CCM’s considerable support, especially among rural voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/entertainment/billie-eilish-billionaires-donation","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:51:00-04:00","title":"Billie Eilish Urges Billionaires to Give Away Money After Announcing $11.5 Million Philanthropic Donation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Billie Eilish announced a $11.5 million donation from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour proceeds to support food equity, client justice, carbon pollution reduction, and climate crisis mitigation.

\nUpdated: \n        9:43 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Scientists say they have found a way to test  ancient human  remains for hormones linked with pregnancy, a breakthrough that may allow archaeologists to determine whether a woman was pregnant or had recently given birth at the time of her death.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers found key reproductive hormones estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in hard tissues, such as the bones and teeth, of skeletons dating back as far as 1,000 years, according to a study published October 2 in the  Journal of Archaeological Science .\n \n\n   \n  “We found a ‘hormone archive’ in skeletons and teeth,” said lead study author Aimée Barlow, an archaeologist at the University of Sheffield, northern England.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a first. Nobody has ever detected these specific hormones in teeth or dental calculus before,” Barlow told CNN. “It is also the first time progesterone has been successfully measured in human bone tissue.”\n \n\n   \n  Pregnancy is difficult to detect in ancient human remains, and scientists previously believed that the composition of hard tissues was so overwhelmingly inorganic that these proteins would not be preserved or detected, Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, she decided to test a number of samples from seven female and three male skeletons dating from the first to 19th centuries using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA is an existing technique used to detect and quantify peptide and protein molecules such as progesterone, a key biomarker for pregnancy, the levels of which increase significantly during the first trimester and are maintained throughout.\n \n\n   \n  Levels of estrogen and testosterone also rise, although not to the same extent, meaning that it was important to also consider the relationship between the three hormones, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  The tests revealed that estrogen, progesterone and testosterone were measurable in bone, and dentin, enamel, calculus and root samples from teeth. “High progesterone levels in dental structures and calculus, the presence of oestrogen in bone, and a lack of testosterone in hard tissues was consistent with pregnancy at the time of death,” the study authors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  This demonstrates “the feasibility and significant potential of the ELISA method for the detection of sex hormones in human skeletal remains to examine the reproductive histories of past populations,” according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  Barlow said proving that the skeleton can preserve hormones would, with many years of further study, potentially allow researchers to determine the age at which a woman first became pregnant, whether she experienced pregnancy loss and how much time had passed between births if she had multiple children.\n \n\n   \n  “This will be especially useful for historical periods where no written records exist,” Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  More work is needed to fully develop the technique for use on ancient remains, she said, including establishing a baseline of hormone levels in skeletal tissues by conducting a much larger study that also involves living individuals with detailed medical records.\n \n\n   \n  “Secondly, we need to understand the fundamental science. We need to learn how these hormones get incorporated into and stored within these different tissues,” Barlow said.\n \n\n   \n  “And we need to explore how these hormones are preserved and broken down (degraded) over time in different burial environments.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Groundbreaking’ findings\n \n\n   \n  Nikolas Lemos, professor of forensic medical sciences at Queen Mary University of London, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that “this is a pioneering study … which has achieved a world-first.”\n \n\n   \n  Lemos underlined that the sample size was “very small,” with only two of the 10 individuals pregnant at death, adding that the ELISA method requires “further testing and validation.”\n \n\n   \n  “In short, while the findings are groundbreaking, they should be viewed as proof of concept, not yet as a routine diagnostic tool,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Although the work is still in its early stages, it represents a remarkable step toward understanding the intimate, hormonal dimensions of life and death in the distant past,” Lemos added.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander Comninos, a professor of endocrinology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said that the research was “fascinating.”\n \n\n   \n  “By understanding reproductive profiles of the past, this can provide insights into how these may have changed over time and perhaps glimpses of the future,” he told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition, the ability to identify these key hormones in bone can trigger further contemporary work in the bone field,” Comninos added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/broadview-ice-facility-illinois-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:45:00-05:00","title":"Advocates allege ‘inhumane’ conditions at Chicago-area ICE facility in new lawsuit","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Advocacy groups, including the ACLU of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center, have filed a lawsuit alleging inhumane conditions at the Broadview federal immigration detention center in Chicago, where detainees face denial of legal counsel, medical care, food, and access to family and journalists.

Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:45 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Illinois advocates sued federal authorities Friday over alleged “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area  federal immigration  facility.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys with the ACLU of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have denied people being held at the  Broadview facility  private calls with attorneys and have blocked members of Congress, faith leaders and journalists from  entering the building , creating a “black box” they say has allowed authorities to act “with impunity.”\n \n\n   \n  Agents have also allegedly coerced people held at the processing center to sign paperwork they don’t understand, leading them to unknowingly relinquish their rights and  face deportation , according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Representatives of ICE and The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office and lead attorney for the lawsuit, said community members are “being kidnapped off the streets, packed in hold cells, denied food, medical care, and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights.”\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone, no matter their legal status, has the right to access counsel and to not be subject to horrific and inhumane conditions,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys accuse ICE, DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection of violating detainees’ Fifth Amendment right to due process and First Amendment right to legal counsel, and have asked the court to force the agencies to improve the facility’s conditions.\n \n\n   \n  Advocates have  for months  raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held at the facility have called it a de facto detention center, where up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.\n \n\n   \n  DHS previously dismissed the claims, saying those held at the facility have proper meals, medical treatment and access to communication with family members and lawyers.\n \n\n   \n  The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, which have led to the arrests of numerous protesters. The protests are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using  tear gas  and other weapons on them.\n \n\n   \n  U.S. District Judge  Sara Ellis  sided with the coalition earlier this month, requiring federal agents in the Chicago area to wear badges and banning them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. Later, Ellis also  required body cameras  for agents  who have them  after raising concerns about her initial order not being followed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:34:00-04:00","title":"Teacher shot by a 6-year-old student thought she was ‘on my way to heaven.’ What we learned from Abby Zwerner’s testimony","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, Abby Zwerner, was shot in the hand and chest by a 6-year-old student on January 6, 2023, during a classroom reading session.

I thought I had died,” Zwerner said with a catch in her voice as she recounted the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s   “blank look” as he aimed at her is a memory Zwerner said she can’t shake.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million  lawsuit  against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  Parker also faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect in the criminal trial against her next month.\n \n\n   \n  The case offers a window into what to expect for the upcoming criminal trial against Parker. Both trials raise questions about who is responsible when children with access to guns carry out school shootings, a pervasive problem across the country.\n \n\n   \n  As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we learned from Zwerner’s moving and highly anticipated testimony.\n \n\n   \n    Effects of shooting linger\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s devastating hand injury has left her unable to do everyday things like open a bottle of   water.\n \n\n   \n  “I was trying to open the bag of chips on my own multiple times, different ways — trying to hold it different ways,” she testified about a recent lunch with her attorney. “And I eventually asked you to open it.”\n \n\n   \n  Even after six surgeries, Zwerner’s hand will never be normal, an orthopedic surgeon testified this week.\n \n\n   \n  Previous testimony from doctors on her care team revealed Zwerner’s injuries were life-threatening after a bullet narrowly missed her heart. And the impacts extended beyond the physical damage, she testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner struggled to describe how she now feels around people, even loved ones, but indicated she feels a “distance” and “numbness.”\n \n\n   \n  Psychiatrist Dr. Clarence Watson testified Thursday Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  Even a planned outing to the movies to see “Hamilton,” which features a duel scene with guns, became an overwhelming task that left her in tears, Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n  When her mother asked her what she wanted to do instead, she felt resigned.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember saying or telling them, ‘nowhere, like I can’t go anywhere. I just want to stay home,’” Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n    Defense tries to undercut teacher’s testimony\n \n\n   \n  During cross-examination Thursday, an attorney for Parker worked to undermine Zwerner’s claims that the shooting has limited her willingness to go out in public.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had been emotionally ready to attend concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school, worked and frequented a gym if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, her doctor had cleared her to do light workouts and she tried her best to do that with weights, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  The defense also pressed Zwerner on whether there was more she could have done after learning of the possible gun threat.\n \n\n   \n  Another school staffer told her about the boy potentially having a gun and she did not inform Parker because she knew the other staffer was going to, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorneys are trying to paint a picture that Zwerner may have been “a little bit at fault” for not acting on information that she had, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “That can be the basis for the defendant not being held negligent and having to pay damages, even if the defendant is more at fault, or mostly at fault,” Brown said .   \n \n\n   \n    What’s next\n \n\n   \n  The jury will reconvene Monday morning in the ongoing civil trial — which could be a roadmap for what’s to come with the criminal litigation against Parker.\n \n\n   \n  Holding civil cases before criminal ones is “really unusual,” Brown said. It may be because Parker waived her right to a speedy trial, and because the defense wants it that way, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “I suspect that defense would want the civil trial to go forward first, because they’re not going to be able to avoid it, and it gives them a lot of information about what would come in at the criminal trial,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  While Zwerner’s pain and suffering have taken center stage in this trial, the upcoming   criminal trial would be more likely to touch on what action Parker failed to take, given her duty to protect children, Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “The more important evidence for the prosecution would be from other witnesses and sources that reveal what the defendant knew with respect to the threat the child posed, and whether he had a gun,” the professor said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/travel/halloween-decorations-st-jude-fundraiser","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"This veteran’s Halloween spirit gave him a new purpose.

We want to help sick children get out of the hospital so they can see all these neat Halloween decorations.’”\n \n\n   \n  So the family printed a simple sign on their front yard that said in part: If you like what you see, feel free to donate to St. Jude – a leading children’s hospital for kids with cancer and other diseases.\n \n\n   \n  Within days, Robertson said a car pulled up with an emotional couple and their young daughter in the backseat. The tearful father told Robertson that they’re a St. Jude family and wanted to thank him for raising money for pay for treatment for families like them.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson didn’t get their names and they never saw each other again. But that encounter changed everything for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d been looking for purpose after retiring from the service,” he said. “This little girl was going through such a tough time, but she saw these goofy plastic skeletons in my yard, it put her in an awesome place.”\n \n\n   \n  The family raised  over $8,000 in 2020  – and the next year, Robertson created a Facebook group called Skeletons for St. Jude to spread the idea nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  This spooky season, the group has more than 5,000 members, and over 1,000 partner homes across the country have joined the cause and raised funds. On October 21, they officially hit the $1 million mark.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson’s neighborhood in North Carolina looks forward to his epic display every year with scores of visitors stopping by every day all month long to soak in the skeleton spectacle.\n \n\n   \n  It takes Robertson a whole year to plan the theme and build new props. He’s accumulated 100 or so toy skeletons that he keeps in storage, and he adds onto the display every day until Halloween — so there’s always something new for visitors to see.\n \n\n   \n  This October, skeletons are sailing on a 25-foot phantom pirate ship that Robertson has positioned so it appears to have crashed through the first and second stories of his house.\n \n\n   \n  “The real focus isn’t on me,” Robertson said. “It’s on the thousands of people giving five or ten dollars here and there. That’s what made this a success.”\n \n\n   \n  Robertson is grateful knowing this money will help families focus on getting their kids better. And he says those families are motivating him to raise another $1 million in half the time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/europe/dutch-centrist-d66-party-election-wins-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-04:00","title":"Dutch Centrist D66 Party Confirmed as Election Winner, ANP Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 Dutch general election, the centrist, pro-EU D66 party won the most votes, narrowly defeating the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) led by Geert Wilders.

putting its 38-year-old leader  Rob Jetten  on course to become the youngest-ever prime minister in the Netherlands.\n \n\n   \n  With almost all votes counted, D66 can no longer be overtaken by the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) led by  Geert Wilders , according to the news agency, which collects the results from all municipalities in the Netherlands.\n \n\n   \n  D66 is now expected to take the lead in a first round of talks to form a coalition  government , a process which usually takes months.\n \n\n   \n  With around 18% of the votes, the party will need at least three coalition partners to reach a simple majority in the 150-seat Lower House of Parliament.\n \n\n   \n  The pro-EU, liberal D66 tripled its seat count with an upbeat campaign and a surge in advertising spending, while Wilders lost a large part of the support that had propelled him to a shock victory at the previous poll in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the election turned into a nailbiter, as preliminary results indicated a narrow victory for D66, while the PVV briefly pulled ahead towards the end of the count.\n \n\n   \n  Although all mainstream parties had already  ruled out  working with him, Wilders had said he would demand to have a first crack at forming a coalition if his party was confirmed to have the most votes.\n \n\n   \n  Confirmation of the result will come on Monday, when mail ballots cast by Dutch residents living abroad are counted.\n \n\n   \n  Party leaders will discuss the next steps on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See

  \n  For a logo with a trademark grin, Wendy’s has little to smile about nowadays.\n \n\n   \n  The burger chain’s stock has lost nearly 50% of its value this year. Wendy’s executive suite has contended with several departures, and it’s currently operating without a permanent CEO after its previous leader abruptly left after just a year-and-a-half on the job. Plus, a confusing mix of promotions hurt sales last quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not happy with our sales performance,” Ken Cook, Wendy’s CFO and interim CEO, bluntly admitted on its most recent earnings call in August.\n \n\n   \n  The fast food industry is in a slump, and Wendy’s isn’t immune. Chief rivals McDonald’s and Burger King also reported sluggish sales earlier this year as consumers cut back spending. However,  both rebounded  over the summer and fall thanks to an increased focus on marketing and targeted promotions.\n \n\n   \n  Not so much for Wendy’s.\n \n\n   \n  US sales at stores open at least a year in the third quarter are forecast to fall 5.8% when the company reports earnings next week, according to Jim Salera, a research analyst for Stephens. That’s even worse than the 3.6% decline in the previous quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “Investors are really focusing on when the company can get same-store sales trends moving back in the right direction and we had seen little progress of that,” Salera told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s is being forced to take action, recently announcing an aggressive turnaround plan that aims to reignite sales. However, revitalizing a 55-year-old chain is not easy.\n \n\n   \n  McDonald’s, which has nearly triple the number of locations in the United States, found recent success with new deals and  menu items . McDonald’s recent growth has also eaten away at some of Wendy’s market share.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s sits in a “more of an elevated position where it’s not just focused on price,” Salera said, and is focused on quality. After all, the chain prides itself on its “fresh, never frozen” tagline for its patties, which has been  in use since its founding in 1969 .\n \n\n   \n  “But as consumers that are trading down or in some cases just trading out entirely and just skipping (fast food) occasions, McDonald’s is leading a lot more with price than an operator like Wendy’s,” he   added.\n \n\n   \n    Back to square one\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s recently announced a  “comprehensive strategic plan”  called “Project Fresh,” under the guidance of former Taco Bell CEO Greg Creed.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s board of directors and management team are dissatisfied with the current valuation of the company and have been working to put the company on the right path to create value for our franchisees, employees and shareholders,” said Art Winkleback, chairman of Wendy’s board, in an October 9 press release.\n \n\n   \n  Plans include refreshed marketing to remind customers of its “rich heritage of quality, innovation and unique voice.” The company also intends to help franchisees improve profits and increase investments in restaurant technology, like digital menus, to “enhance the customer experience.”\n \n\n   \n  BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, however, doesn’t think Wendy’s plan is “tackling the root of the problem” and that its “issues go far deeper than some marketing changes or some menu adjustments.”\n \n\n   \n  Rather, he said that Wendy’s problems stretches back more than a decade to   a  remodel initiative  of its US restaurants that was meant to modernize the chain. Instead, the final product was “watered down a lot” from its initial plan because of several leadership changes.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s is now starting to talk about kind of a multi-year plan to install digital menu boards, which have been around for over a decade,” Saleh told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For comparison, around the same time, McDonald’s  remodeled a vast majority  of its US restaurants, adding digital kiosks and refreshed interiors. The work was largely completed by 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “The biggest problem (Wendy’s) have is not their food … it’s (their restaurants) are old and tired,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Salera agreed that Wendy’s has a “solid offering” with its food. The chain recently relaunched its chicken tenders to  capitalize on the trend  for crispy chicken, and he complimented the  revamped Frosty  offerings to establish it as a “unique Wendy’s asset.”\n \n\n   \n  He said that the brand’s plan of “focusing and skimming down the number of promotions or limited-time offers is a positive (move),” especially after the variety of deals in the “100 Days of Summer” promotion proved to be  too complex  for customers to understand.\n \n\n   \n  Additional details of Wendy’s plan will be revealed during its November 7 earnings call.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/media/disney-youtube-deal-biz-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:30:00-04:00","title":"Disney channels go dark on YouTube TV after media giants fail to resolve carriage dispute","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Disney has removed its channels — including ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel, FX, National Geographic, and Freeform — from YouTube TV following a failed agreement on carriage fees.

The situation is exacerbated by the 2024 House settlement, which mandates revenue sharing with athletes, further straining athletic departments. A key example is Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry’s public criticism of LSU’s $53 million buyout for head coach Brian Kelly, citing taxpayer burden and lack of results. This scrutiny is part of a wider trend: since Oklahoma State fired Mike Gundy in September 2025, 10 FBS schools have fired head coaches, totaling $169 million in buyouts. The article reveals that spending has consistently outpaced revenue growth, with universities like Penn State and LSU seeing football spending rise 40–113% while overall revenues grow only 37–83%. Even staff like coordinators are owed significant sums. Critics argue that the financial model is unsustainable, with no clear source of funds, and that institutions are operating like 'hot air balloons' without a solid foundation.

Jeff Landry took aim at a very specific apex predator: Big-time football.\n \n\n   \n  The governor, who was supposed to be talking about  food stamps that are nearing a crisis point due to the government shutdown , instead launched a verbal grenade directed squarely at the Louisiana State University Athletics Administration Building – aimed more specifically at the desk of athletic director Scott Woodward.\n \n\n   \n  Calling out not just the lack of success under football head coach Brian Kelly but the $53 million bill LSU now has to foot to give the coach his walking papers, Landry publicly defrocked Woodward, making it clear that the man in charge of LSU athletics would not be making the biggest hire for LSU athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “My role is about the fiscal effect of firing a coach under a terrible contract,’’ Landry said after being asked about his role in Kelly’s dismissal after reports indicated discussions about the dismissal went all the way to the governor’s mansion.\n \n\n   \n  “I care about what the taxpayers are on the hook on, and I was not happy about raising ticket prices while we were having a losing season and we were paying a coach $100 million and not getting results.’’\n \n\n   \n  He wasn’t done there.  Landry told ABC  on Thursday that he plans to have the state’s attorney general review the next head coach’s contract “to understand what the extent under which the state is ultimately liable.”\n \n\n   \n  The remarks drew plenty of eye rolls. This is Louisiana, where Huey Long used his own gubernatorial position to influence LSU football nearly a 100 years ago. Pigskin and politics regularly mix.\n \n\n   \n  But in this case, Landry’s public tongue lashing resounded well beyond the reaches of the bayou, earning nods of approval in plenty of other far-flung circles of college athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “Finally, someone said it out loud,’’ said a board of trustees member at another institution. “This is so irresponsible.’’\n \n\n   \n    Buyout season\n \n\n   \n  LSU, after all, is not alone.  Since Oklahoma State fired Mike Gundy  on September 23 through Kelly’s dismissal one month later, 10 FBS schools have ousted their head coaches. Combined the coaches are owed $169 million, all coming at a time when college athletics is facing unprecedented costs.\n \n\n   \n  In June, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken approved the $2.8 billion settlement coming from the so-called House settlement, requiring colleges to directly share revenue with their athletes. The estimated House payouts this year is $20.5 million. That will only go up annually.\n \n\n   \n  It has left plenty of university administrators equal parts dismayed and disgusted at what they believe is nothing shy of fiscal malfeasance, with schools hamstrung by deals presented as security blankets for the university but offering only protection for the coaches.\n \n\n   \n  “No one is flying the plane,’’ a board member at one of the schools affected said. “There’s not even a plane. It’s a hot air balloon. Whatever way the wind blows, that’s the way college sports go.’’\n \n\n   \n  That college football is spending at an unprecedented pace is not new news. Arguing a very expensive need to keep up with the Joneses (or maybe more accurately the Sabans and Meyers) to succeed, coaches long have asked for bigger, better and more.\n \n\n   \n  Facility one-upsmanship, all in the name of attracting better recruits, led to practice facilities with mini-golf courses (Clemson), marble showers in the locker room (Oregon) and sensory deprivation tanks (Georgia). Then came more staff – to run the analytics and sports performance and nutrition and, in some cases, the head coach. Texas has not one, not two but three special assistants to the head coach.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, when simply ballooning coaching contracts was no longer enough, the deals also had to be guaranteed, lest another school poach your leader.\n \n\n   \n  At the start of the season, nine head coaches were making more than $10 million annually, according to the USA Today head coaches database, and 12 had buyouts totaling more than $40 million, topped by Kirby Smart’s $105 million owed should Georgia decide to can him.\n \n\n   \n  Except now, as some of those bills come due at the same time revenue sharing comes into existence, the very real question is no longer an existential crisis. Just where is the money coming from?\n \n\n   \n  “I have no idea,’’ said another board member at an affected school. “The money does not exist.’’\n \n\n   \n  That startling and yet very real revelation flies in the face of what has long been the presiding sentiment about college football: That it is the big money meal ticket for an athletics department.\n \n\n   \n  For years it was not bottom-line accurate —rare was the department that ran in the black – but at least true in theory. Thanks to TV rights packages and tens of thousands of fannies in the seats on fall Saturdays, college football did draw the biggest paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  Except somewhere along the line the spending steamrolled ahead of the profits.\n \n\n   \n    ‘No one has the answer’\n \n\n   \n  Consider two of the schools on the hook for two of the biggest coaching buyouts: Penn State, which owes  James Franklin $49 million  and LSU, on the hook for $53 million for Kelly.\n \n\n   \n  According to the KnightNewhouse College Athletics Database, in the last 10 years Penn State’s football spending has jumped 113% but the entire department’s revenues have grown only 83%. At LSU, football spending jumped 44% and revenues just 40%.\n \n\n   \n  In the same decade, football coaching salaries (the entire staff) jumped 106% in State College and 90% in Baton Rouge while ticket sales only added an additional 33% and 37% respectively and donor contributions jumped 53% and 66%.\n \n\n   \n  The money owed can be mitigated. Most contracts include what are called best efforts clauses, which means the ex-coach can’t hole up in Cabo and get his entire paycheck. He has to look for a job, and should he land one, the salary owed will be less the salary gained.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like being divorced and paying alimony,’’ one of the board members joked. “You’re rooting for them to get remarried.’’\n \n\n   \n  But it is not simply the head coaches that need to be paid out.  The Advertiser i n Louisiana reported that offensive coordinator Joe Sloan, fired along with Kelly, is due $530,000. Penn State defensive coordinator Jim Knowles reportedly is in the first year of a three-year deal worth $3.1 million annually and offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki is making $2.4 million. It will be up to the next coach – who, by the way, will not come at a bargain-basement price – to decide if they stay on.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile Penn State last year was on the hook for more than $900,000 in football coaching severance per the KnightNewhouse database, presumably due to Mike Yurcich, Kotelnicki’s predecessor who was fired in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft, who through a spokesperson declined comment for this story, has insisted that Franklin’s buyout is “an athletics issue. This is not the institution’s issue. We in athletics are covering the costs.”\n \n\n   \n  But from where? “No one has the answer,’’ one of the board members said.\n \n\n   \n    No signs of stopping\n \n\n   \n  Still, the race to the top of the money pile goes on.\n \n\n   \n  A pitch to turn to private equity for the Big Ten has at least temporarily stalled, in large part because of pushback from conference members USC and Michigan. Deep-pocketed donors are now being asked to foot the bill for coaching salaries, facilities improvements and – thanks to the House settlement – player contracts.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Tech recently announced a planned $229 million investment in athletics over the next four years. Along with seeking donor support for $30 million of that annually, the university said there will be “limited increases in student fees.’’ In 2024, student fees generated $14.5 million for the athletic department.\n \n\n   \n  “That deal should terrify boards everywhere,’’ one of the trustees said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the logic gleaned from the accounting books arguing to the contrary, spending is showing no signs of stopping.  Curt Cignetti has done wonders  at Indiana, elevating a program that ranked somewhere below historically dormant to No. 2 in the nation.\n \n\n   \n  He has coached 21 games at Indiana – 21 at the FBS level entirely. And last week the school inked him to an eight-year, $93 million deal. It’s all guaranteed.\n \n\n   \n  And less than 24 hours after the governor undercut Woodward at LSU, the athletic director was, to no one’s surprise, negotiating his exit strategy from the school. That leaves the school without a university president (William Tate left in May to take the same position at Rutgers), no football coach and no athletic director.\n \n\n   \n  According to Yahoo Sports, Woodward is owed somewhere in the neighborhood of $6.4 million. The school is expected to honor the terms – another buyout on the Bayou.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/6-7-meme-slang-explained-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00Z","title":"The '6-7' meme can be annoying.

But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all. It’s become  so  ubiquitous that Dictionary.com  named  it the word of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/trump-nuclear-weapons-testing-experts-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he wants to resume nuclear testing.

wants to resume nuclear testing. Here’s why experts are confused \n       \n  By Tom Foreman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A ghost of the Cold War is rising between the world’s superpowers, just in time for Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  In the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin bragging about his country testing both a nuclear-powered torpedo and a new cruise missile, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, has fired back. In a lengthy post on his  Truth Social platform , Trump announced, “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  Now ,  nuclear watchdogs worldwide are wondering  what might come of Trump’s pronouncement  — and what he even means since the US hasn’t conducted a nuclear weapons test in decades.\n \n\n   \n  “First of all, every statement in that post is wrong,” said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear weapons expert at Harvard University. “It’s not true the United States has the world’s most nuclear weapons. It’s not true that other states are carrying out nuclear tests. (Trump) seems to think it’s the Department of Defense that carries out nuclear tests. It’s not. It’s the Department of Energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s own nominee to head the US Strategic Command seemed unclear of the president’s intent as he faced the Senate Armed Service Committee in a confirmation hearing Thursday. “Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test,” Navy Vice Adm. Richard Correll said, “so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out.”\n \n\n   \n  The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation defines nuclear tests as “generally controlled explosions of nuclear devise, such as bombs or warheads,” and Russia’s missile and torpedo tests do not meet that strict definition. \n \n\n   \n  What’s more, Jon Wolfsthal, who advised both Joe Biden and Barack Obama on nuclear matters, notes other nations are already conducting similar tests – along with the US. “Russia, the United States, China are all investing tens of billions of dollars on new nuclear delivery platforms – missiles, bombers, submarines,” Wolfsthal said. “We have returned to the arms race dynamics of the Cold War where each side believes nuclear weapons are important.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump truly wants to resume nuclear weapons testing, analysts say the complications are deep and wide. For starters, almost every nuclear-capable country in the world has voluntarily agreed to avoid such tests for decades. Russia ran its last test in 1990, the US in 1992 and China in 1996. North Korea is the only nation to conduct nuclear blasts this century, and that has contributed to Pyongyang’s status as an international pariah.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the diplomatic risk of standing up a fresh set of tests in the US, there are technical challenges. Federal studies have shown staging such a test safely would likely require several years of preparation, and even then, it might yield little useful information. The US routinely tests nuclear weapons components so thoroughly that America is widely seen as holding a treasure trove of nuclear knowledge unmatched by any other country.\n \n\n   \n  Critics say if Trump ushers in a new era of testing, that will only open the door for any other nation with nuclear dreams to start catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “The country that would benefit the most would be China,” Bunn said.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes no sense from a strategic point of view for the United States,” said former Democratic congressman John Tierney, who now heads the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.\n \n\n   \n  Nuclear weapons experts note that both Russia and China have stepped up their nuclear aspirations already. Some political analysts speculate that Trump is hoping to back them down with tough talk, a notion he seems to echo. “I’d like to see a denuclearization,” the president said. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the Defense Department nor the White House has offered a more complete explanation of the plan as of yet.\n \n\n   \n  But Tierney finds the president’s constantly shifting talk troublesome, to say the least. He fears in an already tense international environment, Trump is injecting more instability – which can prove explosive in its own way.\n \n\n   \n  “One day he wants everyone to get rid of their nukes,” Tierney says. “The next day he wants to start testing? It’s dangerous.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/style/maurizio-cattelan-america-gold-toilet-sothebys","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:33:00-04:00","title":"How much would you pay for an infamous gold toilet?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the controversial and infamous gold toilet sculpture titled 'America' by artist Maurizio Cattelan, originally exhibited in the Guggenheim Museum in 2016 and later stolen from Blenheim Palace in 2019.

Though the perpetrators  were convicted earlier this year , the fully functional, opulent toilet, titled “America,” was never found, believed to be cut up or melted down for the value of the gold itself, worth millions.\n \n\n   \n  But that isn’t the end of the saga for the satirical sculpture, which was once offered to President Donald J. Trump during his first term, in lieu of a Van Gogh painting requested by his administration (the counteroffer was  reportedly ignored) .\n \n\n   \n  Cattelan has previously stated he had made more than one edition of “America,” and now a second edition is making an unexpected, flashy debut on the art market next month.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s in New York will sell the work, which has been in private (and anonymous) hands since 2017, on November 18. That also means the sculpture will be back on public view for a limited time, when the auction house installs it in the fourth-floor bathroom of its brand-new headquarters for 10 days leading up to the sale. This time, however, visitors will not be able to use it, per Sotheby’s. Officially that’s for security reasons, though one can guess why else.\n \n\n   \n  “The door will remain open,” said David Galperin, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art, laughing.\n \n\n   \n  Auctions typically have a set starting bid, informed by a number of market factors, as well as low and high sales numbers, estimated ahead of time. But the sale for this “America” will be worth its weight in gold — quite literally — as the starting figure will be its inherent value, fluctuating with the gold market right up until bidding begins. That will be somewhere in the $10 million range, according to the current value (with the price of gold lately  setting record highs ), plus whatever collectors deem its ascribed value to be.\n \n\n   \n  “The starting bid in accordance with the price of gold was really a way to lean into the very essence of the conceptual basis behind the artwork, which is largely to draw attention to the difference between a work’s artistic value, and a work’s inherent material value,” Galperin explained.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a “perfect foil” to Cattelan’s other equally infamous banana-on-a-wall, “Comedian,” which  sold for $6.24 million at Sotheby’s last fall , Galperin added. The duct-taped banana, worthless without Cattelan’s association, first debuted at Art Basel Miami on a bare white wall, originally priced at $120,000.  It has been eaten more than once .\n \n\n   \n  “If ‘Comedian’ was all about the intangibility of value and how we ascribe value to works of art, ‘America’ challenges that a step further by being in so many ways, intrinsically valuable, in a manner that so many works of art are not.”\n \n\n   \n  “America” is many things: a wry comment on the art world and the United States, as well as an object of torment for arts publicists and their lofty press statements. (The Guggenheim once described it as an opportunity for “unprecedented intimacy with a work of art.”) And this edition may actually be the only physical one in existence, according to Sotheby’s. Though the work is an edition of three, the auction house does not believe the third has been fabricated.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the sculpture’s dramatic history, Galperin said “America” is an important 21st-century artwork, one with a direct lineage to landmark Modern art (see: Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 upside-down urinal “Fountain”), but with critical relevance to today.\n \n\n   \n  “Cattelan, for his entire career, has critiqued the system,” Galperin said, “whether it’s the viewers’ experience seeing art in a museum, the way that works of art move through the system, the way that they’re valued, the way that they change hands.\n \n\n   \n  “All of these concepts are things that artworks so rarely confront head on. His ability to do that and do it in such a legible way and impactful way is part of its success here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/middleeast/iran-rebuilding-ballistic-weapons-program-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:07:00-04:00","title":"Western intelligence says Iran is rearming despite UN sanctions, with China’s help","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is reportedly rearming its ballistic missile program despite the reinstatement of UN sanctions via the snapback mechanism, with Chinese entities facilitating the delivery of 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate — a key precursor to solid-fuel missile propellant — to Iran's Bandar Abbas port.

\nUpdated: \n        9:07 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran appears to be stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the reintroduction last month of  United Nations sanctions  that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity.\n \n\n   \n  European intelligence sources say several shipments of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas since the so-called  “snapback” mechanism  was triggered at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  Those sources say the shipments, which began arriving on September 29, contain 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers in the wake of its  12-day conflict with Israel in June . The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic’s depleted missile stocks. Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles. However, experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by the intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew. Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China.\n \n\n   \n  Planet Labs satellite images provided to CNN by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies confirm that the Barzin was being loaded with cargo at Gaolan Port, China, on October 1, before departing for Iran. The images then show the Barzin docked at Rajaei Port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, from October 16 to October 19, where it was being unloaded.\n \n\n   \n  The Elyana left the Chinese port of Changjiangkou on September 18 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12. Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear if the Chinese government is aware of the shipments. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had previously been reported, but their intensification since the 12-day war – when the Israeli military targeted at least a third of the surface-to-surface launchers that fire Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) – suggests a renewed eagerness on the part of the Islamic Republic to arm itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm.\n \n\n   \n  “Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles.  That’s a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Long-standing ties\n \n\n   \n  China has long been a  diplomatic and economic ally  for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran’s oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years.\n \n\n   \n  That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. These so-called teapot refineries are known to work with what’s often referred to as a dark fleet of tankers that use concealing tactics to smuggle sanctioned goods.\n \n\n   \n  European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources.\n \n\n   \n    Earlier shipments\n \n\n   \n  In February, CNN  reported the shipment  of 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran from China. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the shipments continued, the intelligence sources say, with the IRGC’s Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization acquiring another 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate which left Taicang in China aboard the Hamouna on May 22 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on June 14 or 15. It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds.\n \n\n   \n  The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. The first of the 10 to 12 shipments that European intelligence sources have been tracking arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the snapback mechanism – triggered in August by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the European partners to the JCPOA – restored UN sanctions. The others all left China after the sanctions were in place.\n \n\n   \n  Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that China’s position on the legal status of the reimposition of sanctions may be related to how its authorities would view such shipments.\n \n\n   \n  “First and foremost, China – along with Russia and Iran – has denounced the legality of the snapback in a joint letter to the UN issued on October 18, indicating that Beijing likely does not consider itself bound by the reimposed measures,” according to Zhao.\n \n\n   \n  Had the snapback not been triggered, October 18 would have marked the official end of the 10-year JCPOA, at which point the option to reimpose previous UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire and the Security Council would close Iran’s nuclear file.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program. The UN Security Council  voted down  the China-backed resolution in September, one day before the snapback came into force.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing was one of the six countries – along with France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US – that signed the JCPOA with Iran in 2015. In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China’s stance that it “attaches importance to Iran’s repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Zhao also pointed to the fact that the export of sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime that is now back in force. What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon delivery system.\n \n\n   \n  So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran’s missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China’s sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in over 150 years, devastated the Caribbean in October 2025, causing widespread destruction, flooding, and loss of life.

October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after  Hurricane Melissa  tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds have  already unleashed  widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa lashed Bermuda as a Category 1 storm overnight Thursday into Friday as the storm passed the islands, bringing quick-hitting bursts of strong wind and rain. The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical as it races south of Newfoundland into cooler Atlantic water.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the storm, authorities in Bermuda closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands across the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  At least 49 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.\n \n\n   \n  The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.\n \n\n   \n    Jamaica hardest hit\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica took the  heaviest battering . Melissa made landfall there as a  Category 5 storm , with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).\n \n\n   \n  “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit coastal town of Black River on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  People gathering around the Black River Bridge searched for water, food and news about their loved ones. The Jamaican Defense Forces have landed in the area by helicopter, but desperation is setting in for residents, Van Dam reported. Many are trying to leave the area with their personal items by car, motorbike or on foot.\n \n\n   \n  Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15 feet of storm surge from Hurricane Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.\n \n\n   \n  The heat and humidity are complicating recovery efforts. There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”\n \n\n   \n  “What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17 th  century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.\n \n\n   \n  But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.\n \n\n   \n  In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, education minister Dana Morris Dixon said in a Tuesday  statement .\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, more than 13,000 residents were still in shelters, while 72% of the island was without power,  Jamaican government officials  said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, minister for local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel pushing more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Schools around the capital Kingston on the eastern side of the island are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba\n \n\n   \n  Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday. The country sustained “extensive damage,” according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n \n\n   \n  This included flooding, mudslides, property destruction and infrastructure damage, particularly in Cuba’s eastern regions, where hundreds of rural communities were left isolated.\n \n\n   \n  As many as 140,000 people were cut off due to rising rivers as the storm passed, according to  the Red Cross . In the province of Santiago, at least 241 communities were cut off due to the storm, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were evacuated in Cuba as Melissa approached.\n \n\n   \n  Cuba’s foreign ministry said it is in touch with the US State Department to get clarity on how the United States would be willing to help with recovery.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio  announced  earlier Thursday that the US is “prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance” to the Cuban people – both directly and through local partners.\n \n\n   \n  The administration of President Donald Trump has historically taken a hard-line stance against the communist-ruled island. In June, the president signed a  memorandum  that the White House said would increase pressure on the Cuban government and support the long-running US economic embargo of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio said Thursday that US law includes exemptions that authorize private donations of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to Cuba, as well as disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío responded to the offer by  saying : “We have been in contact with the State Department and are awaiting clarification on how and in what way they are willing to assist.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuba is already receiving some aid from partners such as China and Venezuela, as well as the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n    High death toll in Haiti\n \n\n   \n  The highest death toll so far has been reported in Haiti, where the hurricane did not make direct landfall but caused significant damage and at least 30 deaths, Reuters said. Twenty of these fatalities, including 10 children, were due to flooding in Petit-Goâve, where a flooded river burst its banks.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    International efforts\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding.

Porowski says that conversations around sexual health don’t have to be awkward \n       \n  By Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Many years before he became the resident foodie and one fifth of the makeover dream team on “ Queer Eye ,” Antoni Porowski already had no problem having important and frank conversations.\n \n\n   \n  “I learned about STIs probably before I hit puberty,” he told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  When Porowski later called out his physician father   for broaching the subject of sexually transmitted infections when he was quite young, his dad’s response was, “Well you know what, you had to know and you were going to find out at some point anyway.”\n \n\n   \n  Porowski – whose mother, sister and grandfather also have medical backgrounds – grew up around science and having conversations about health, sexual and otherwise, and he says he feels privileged to have had that access to helpful information early on. It’s one of the reasons he’s partnering with pharmaceutical company Gilead to promote HIV prevention and having open discussions about sexual health.\n \n\n   \n  “The more you talk about it, anything that’s uncomfortable, the less precious it becomes. It loses its power,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski’s involvement in the  campaign  comes at a time of  unprecedented  cutbacks on DEI programs, which among many other things contain efforts designed to help people realize and achieve sexual wellness through access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP, drugs that prevents HIV infections, which are produced by companies including Gilead) and other information. Analysis of federal data by the  New York Times  in May found that Donald Trump’s administration had scrapped more than $800 million worth of research into the health of LGBTQ+ people.\n \n\n   \n  “With all of these unfortunate initiatives, I think it pushes us more towards stigmatization, because it helps fuel the taboo and negative understandings and perceptions of a lot of things,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  “Often as we’re seeing in culture right now and in politics, the things that a lot of certain people are afraid of, they end up turning (it) into anger, and it then flips to taking away or minimizing rights because they just don’t get it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  For Porwoski, the current political landscape and its challenges present an opportunity to “keep talking about this even more than we did.”\n \n\n   \n  “Because as much progress as we’ve made – progress isn’t linear, as I’m learning with a lot of things, especially politically,” he said. “The key for anything that is misunderstood or misperceived, I think it’s an opportunity to have a conversation about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Part of his understanding comes from his involvement on “ Queer Eye ,” which will soon premiere its tenth and final season. The show has long focused on the ongoing conversations between queer and non-queer people, and their efforts to understand one another.\n \n\n   \n  “People who we’ve met on the show who definitely leaned more on the conservative side knew us as concepts, before meeting us,” he said. “They have their ideas of what it’s like to be queer and that was it.”\n \n\n   \n  The way past that, he said, was to help them “realize that we’re someone’s kid.”\n \n\n   \n  To “get to know the person as an individual and not a concept” is “a good blanket statement for any type of intolerance or lack of embracing of diversity in our culture,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Making connections and having meaningful conversations is ultimately what Porowski comes back to, for both learning the value of tolerance and arming oneself with information for better health by having those meaningful conversations with a doctor.\n \n\n   \n  “Talk to a physician, ask the questions, that’s literally what they’re there for,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski says that while he had the “great gift of being raised around science and trusting it,” he knows there are others who weren’t and don’t.\n \n\n   \n  He urges those people “who sit on the other end of the spectrum, of not trusting it” to “just shut up and put your curiosity hat on and ask questions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ask things that you’re genuinely curious about, so that you can educate yourself,” he said. “I think we all have a responsibility to educate ourselves.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-closing-times-election-results","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:10:00-04:00","title":"When polls close in Tuesday’s elections and when to expect results","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Tuesday, October 31, 2025, the U.S. will witness the first major elections of President Donald Trump’s second term, with key races in Virginia, New Jersey, New York City, and California.

NFL  action on Thursday Night Football, throwing four touchdown passes to lead his Baltimore Ravens to a 28-6 win over the Miami Dolphins.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson had missed the past three Ravens games with a hamstring injury, with Baltimore struggling in his absence.\n \n\n   \n  But with the two-time NFL MVP back in the lineup, the Ravens looked much more like themselves, piling up 338 yards of offense, 229 coming in the second half.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson connected on touchdown passes to Rashod Bateman, Charlie Kolar and twice to Mark Andrews.\n \n\n   \n  And while he didn’t look as explosive when he chose to run the ball, the 28-year-old’s return seemed to open up the running game in general, with the team racking up 150 yards on the ground, including 119 for Derrick Henry on 19 carries.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awesome,” Jackson afterwards. “It’s great to be back and get a dub.”\n \n\n   \n  It was the Dolphins, coming off a big win last week against the Atlanta Falcons, who took the lead in the first quarter with a field goal before Jackson capitalized on a fumble by Tahj Washington, connecting with Andrews for their first touchdown of the game.\n \n\n   \n  Baltimore extended its lead in the second quarter with Andrews’ second touchdown reception of the game, capping off an eight-play, 75-yard scoring drive.\n \n\n   \n  A Miami field goal just before halftime did reduce the deficit but the Dolphins failed to make any further inroads on offense after halftime, with Baltimore adding 14 points in the third quarter to ease to victory.\n \n\n   \n  “I just felt a little comfortable and our guys were ready to score,” Jackson – who finished with 204 yards on 18-of-23 passing – said. “Shoutout to the offensive line. They did great.\n \n\n   \n  “All phases, all skill positions, and our running backs, those guys were just locked in and wanted to put points on the board because we only scored twice in the first half.”\n \n\n   \n  In what was Jackson’s first action since September 28, he continued his excellent record against the Dolphins. The Florida native now has 1,405 passing yards, 18 passing touchdowns, one interception and a 142.9 passer rating in five starts against Miami, the highest by any single player (minimum 100 attempts) vs. a single opponent in history,  per NFL Research .\n \n\n   \n  His return to the field is timely for Baltimore which has now won two in a row to keep its season alive, improving to 3-5 on the year.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens still face an uphill battle to make it to the postseason, but with Jackson back at the helm, that journey seems a little easier.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , only four teams since the 1970 merger have made the playoffs after starting a season 1-5. But, since 1990, 21 teams have made the postseason with a 3-5 opening.\n \n\n   \n  For the Dolphins, it was another crushing defeat as they slip to 2-7 and the pressure ramps back up on head coach Mike McDaniel after their big win over Atlanta last time out.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of their games this season, the loss to the Ravens was punctuated by self-inflicted errors – Washington’s first-quarter fumble gave excellent field position to Baltimore, a false start by Larry Borom on fourth-and-1 ended a promising drive, Riley Patterson missed a close field goal and Malik Washington also fumbled in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Miami produced its best performance of the season in Week 8 against the Falcons but Thursday’s outing will do nothing to quiet the talk around McDaniel’s future.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/style/fondation-beyeler-chanel-culture-fund","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:26:00-04:00","title":"Swiss Art Museum Appoints First-Ever Botanical Curator, Backed by Chanel Culture Fund","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Fondation Beyeler in Switzerland has appointed Rahel Kesselring as its first-ever botanical curator, a role supported by the Chanel Culture Fund.

Designed by Pritzker Prize–winning architect  Renzo Piano , the flat-roofed, single-story gallery in Riehen is gently nestled among centuries-old trees and mossy lily ponds, surrounded by green fields and vineyards, at the edge of Germany’s Black Forest.\n \n\n   \n  Since opening nearly 30 years ago, the Fondation Beyeler has hosted many site-specific artworks that engaged directly with its natural environment. In 1998, the late artist  Christo  wrapped 178 trees on the property in fabric, and, more recently,  Olafur Eliasson  removed part of the building’s facade to effectively bring one of the outdoor ponds into the gallery itself. The Icelandic artist used a non-toxic dye to give the water a neon glow, describing the work as a “model for a future landscape where human and non-humans can live together” more harmoniously.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the institution is announcing a groundbreaking new role. In what is believed to be the first of its kind at a major art museum, the Fondation Beyeler has appointed Swiss academic Rahel Kesselring as its inaugural botanical curator. Her role will focus on the preservation of the site’s flora and fauna and on developing public programming within its gardens.\n \n\n   \n  The position — officially, the Chanel botanical curator — is supported by the Chanel Culture Fund, a philanthropic arm of the French luxury house that backs innovative cultural projects and initiatives around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring explained that her mission is to strengthen the dialogue between art and nature. “Plants are enormously important for our culture,” she said in a video interview. “They sustain us…we live in a world that has been fully built by plants. We have a deep connection to them, physically, culturally and historically.”\n \n\n   \n  Museum director Sam Keller called the appointment a reflection of the institution’s ethos. “Nature is not a backdrop to our work, but a living part of it,” he said in a statement. “This role affirms our commitment to caring for the whole ecology of this place with the same depth, imagination and responsibility we bring to everything we do.”\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring’s appointment  presents a new model for arts institutions — expanding the idea of curatorial expertise beyond the white walls of a gallery and into the living landscape.\n \n\n   \n  With the symptoms of climate crisis increasingly felt by people and businesses, including those within the art world, the Fondation Beyeler is making a statement by putting ecological stewardship on par with artistic curation. Kesselring hopes it will inspire broader change or, at least, more public engagement. “We need to rewrite our understanding of our relationship with nature,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Yana Peel, the president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel, said during a video call that with no brick-and-mortar cultural institutions of its own (as is common for many luxury brands), the company has focused on contributing to others — seeking out ways to create impact on a project-by-project basis.\n \n\n   \n  “We have specifically not been sponsoring galas or parties or short-term projects,” she said, explaining that they want to focus on “transformational” work that is entirely non-transactional and not aimed at selling Chanel products. The initiative is about “wanting to have a positive impact on the world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chanel did not confirm how long it would be funding Kesselring’s role at the foundation but it’s understood to be a multi-year partnership, in keeping with the fund’s wider mission to focus on longer-term projects.\n \n\n   \n  Established five years ago, the Chanel Culture Fund has invested in 50 projects across 15 countries. Chanel is working with the Power Station of Art in Shanghai to support a significant renovation of the institution’s third-floor gallery, including the addition of the first contemporary art library in China, with the capacity to house 50,000 books. In Brazil, the fund partnered with the Pinacoteca de São Paulo on a new annual residency program to support women artists. And in the US, the organization is funding the Chanel Center for Artists and Technology at CalArts in Southern California.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/sudan-massacres-rsf-rebels-darfur-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:06:00Z","title":"Rebels Accused of Massacring Hundreds in Sudanese City as Videos of Atrocities Emerge","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on alleged mass killings and systematic war crimes committed by Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in El Fasher, a city in Darfur.

Nada Bashir, Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:26 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An elderly man sits on the floor, dozens of bodies lying around him, before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)  took over the city  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”\n \n\n   \n  Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.\n \n\n   \n  Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s  withdrawal from El Fasher  earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.\n \n\n   \n  RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration,  accused the RSF of committing genocide  against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.\n \n\n   \n  One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.\n \n\n   \n  The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.\n \n\n   \n  Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.\n \n\n   \n  Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.\n \n\n   \n  Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.\n \n\n   \n  Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.\n \n\n   \n  The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.\n \n\n   \n  “So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.\n \n\n   \n  Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”\n \n\n   \n  “(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.\n \n\n   \n  “On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.\n \n\n   \n  “All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the  Russian paramilitary group Wagner .\n \n\n   \n  The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”\n \n\n   \n    Fears for the missing men\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”\n \n\n   \n  Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”\n \n\n   \n  “Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.\n \n\n   \n  “The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.\n \n\n   \n  He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.\n \n\n   \n  The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.\n \n\n   \n  As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.\n \n\n   \n  Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/economy/us-government-shutdown-economy-snowball","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"As the shutdown drags on, here’s how it can drag down the economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A prolonged federal government shutdown in October–November 2025 is creating widespread economic risks, with economists warning that the longer it continues, the greater the damage to jobs, healthcare access, consumer spending, and inflation control.

Alicia Wallace, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  federal government shutdown  has lasted all month and is on pace to become the longest on record.\n \n\n   \n  While history has shown that the economy typically rebounds from a shutdown within a couple of months, each day it drags on brings   a greater risk that the economy  won’t just bend but will start to break — and rupture livelihoods in the process, economists say.\n \n\n   \n  “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  Congressional Budget Office estimates released Wednesday projected that the shutdown has permanently sapped at least $7 billion in output from the economy.\n \n\n   \n  The negative effects start to build on themselves very rapidly and the collateral damage becomes more widespread, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering momentum and mass,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Predicting something that has becoming increasingly unpredictable is an impossible task, but here’s a look at how the shutdown could ripple through critical avenues of everyday life.\n \n\n   \n    Jobs\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the shutdown, the US job market  was already on its back .\n \n\n   \n  It’s been a  low-hire, low-fire, low-churn environment . Employers, frozen by high economic and policy uncertainty, have held off making investments and adding workers. Some businesses have used this period to test the waters on  artificial intelligence  and other technologies – in turn putting to the test that “low-fire” descriptor by announcing mass layoffs in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,” Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  Considering that backdrop, the tepid job gains can potentially turn into deeper job losses if safety nets become frayed, more paychecks are missed by federal workers and contractors, and spending pullbacks reverberate through the private sector, causing businesses to lay off workers or shut down, he said.\n \n\n   \n  A US Chamber of Commerce analysis released this week estimated that 65,500 small business contractors have billions of dollars in payments at risk because of the shutdown — $12 billion in payments for the month alone.\n \n\n   \n  Rate cuts and some greater clarity around trade deals and tariffs were supposed to fuel a rebound in hiring heading into 2026, noted Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at employment site ZipRecruiter.\n \n\n   \n  “However, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year’s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,” she wrote in a note earlier this month. “This would delay hiring plans that might otherwise materialize, keeping the labor market stuck in place.”\n \n\n   \n  US consumer confidence during October dipped to its lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump announced a massive suite of steep tariffs on imported goods, according to The Conference Board’s latest index released this week.\n \n\n   \n    Health care and the care economy\n \n\n   \n  The expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage is at the  crux of the Congressional stalemate  to fund the federal government and end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, while  Republicans say they won’t negotiate  until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Open enrollment starts on November 1, and the more than 22 million Americans who use the federal health insurance marketplace are  expected to see their monthly premium leap  by 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis.\n \n\n   \n  Also on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico are at risk of  losing access to Head Start programs , which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households.\n \n\n   \n  Any center closures could quickly increase financial hardship for lower-earnings families. Child care disruptions have been shown to  negatively impact labor force participation  (particularly  for women ), productivity growth and overall economic growth.\n \n\n   \n    Spending\n \n\n   \n  The lengthier the shutdown, the higher the probability for a greater drag on overall economic activity, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.\n \n\n   \n  “And this isn’t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you’re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn’t happen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  There’s the job that doesn’t get filled, the trip that doesn’t get taken and the holiday spending that doesn’t occur.\n \n\n   \n  “At some point, things start to break because they’re just not getting done,” added Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics. “When this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence – consumer, business, investor confidence – the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.”\n \n\n   \n  If the shutdown continues past Thanksgiving, “there’s no coming back from that quickly,” he said, adding that once it passes that “point of no return,” it will cause “damage that’s longer-lasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. It has remained  largely resilient , despite massive uncertainty and persistently high inflation.\n \n\n   \n  However, it’s likely done so because of an increasingly bifurcated, or  “K-shaped” economy . Wealthy consumers, buoyed in part by strong market gains, are driving more of the spending while lower- and middle-income households are facing increased strain.\n \n\n   \n    Prices and interest rates\n \n\n   \n  A drawn-out shutdown could inject further “crosscurrents” into an already  choppy price environment , Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  On one hand, disruptions to government services and funding could affect trade and supply chains, driving up prices. On the other hand, a weakened economy would mean it’s harder for companies to raise prices, which could help keep overall inflation in check.\n \n\n   \n  “The net of all that, I think, is hard to know,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the shutdown and its economic fallout could give the Federal Reserve one more reason to  continue cutting interest rates , he added.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fed’s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions,” he said. “This [shutdown] would weaken the already fragile job market more.”\n \n\n   \n    The human impact\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown could very well exacerbate those struggles for many Americans, especially people on the margins.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans are “not taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they’re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment,” Zandi said. “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think so.”\n \n\n   \n  A lack of funding for safety net programs,  particularly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , could not only exacerbate hunger and hardship for tens of millions of Americans, but also threatens to destabilize local economies, especially in rural areas.\n \n\n   \n  “It just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,” KPMG economist Swonk said. “Low- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard when you see the struggles we’re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,” she added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/apec-summit-xi-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"China’s Xi in the limelight at Pacific summit with Trump conspicuous by his absence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, China's President Xi Jinping took center stage due to the conspicuous absence of U.S. President Donald Trump, who had recently concluded a trade agreement with China involving a 10% tariff reduction and delays in rare earth export controls.

limelight at Pacific summit with Trump conspicuous by his absence \n       \n  By Helen Regan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:43 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Leaders of Pacific countries and territories, including China’s Xi Jinping, are gathering in South Korea for a major summit Friday. But the leader of one global powerhouse is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The US president flew out of South Korea Thursday, moments after his  landmark meeting  with his Chinese counterpart that appeared to  de-escalate the protracted trade conflict  between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  With Trump choosing to skip the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation – which groups together countries accounting for more than half of global trade – Xi stepped into the limelight and will hold high-profile meetings, including with Japan’s new leader Sanae Takaichi and Canada’s Mark Carney.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his absence, Trump’s protectionist trade policies and punishing global tariffs loom over the two-day event in the city of Gyeongju. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is standing in for Trump during the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  In his opening remarks to the forum, Xi called for unity and cooperation between the grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific.\n \n\n   \n  “The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”\n \n\n   \n  “China’s door to openness will not close; it will only open wider,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year is on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.\n \n\n   \n  “We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “As the free trade order undergoes dramatic changes, global economic uncertainty is deepening, and trade and investment are losing momentum.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee said that “only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s three-leg tour of Asia, which stopped in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, was generally regarded as a success for all parties, with Asian leaders putting on a  masterclass in hospitality  and flattery as they sought to get the president on side — and ease trade negotiations in the process.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s meeting with Xi ended in a trade agreement that called for the US to lower tariffs on China by 10%, bringing the effective rate on Chinese exports down to 47%; and for China to delay some export controls on rare earths and resume purchases of American soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  In Japan, Trump and freshly appointed Prime Minister Takaichi embarked on a “new golden age” of relations and signed a critical minerals agreement. And a new trade deal reached with Lee would see South Korea invest billions of dollars in the US, including in shipbuilding, aerospace and technology,  according  to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Xi met Japan’s Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.\n \n\n   \n  Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi faces a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes. \n \n\n   \n  Xi also held meetings with Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, according to Chinese state media.\n \n\n   \n  In comments that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”\n \n\n   \n  Canada, he said, was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/business/k-shaped-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"This burrito is everything you need to know about America’s economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. economy is experiencing a 'K-shaped' bifurcation, where wealthy consumers continue to spend freely due to stock market gains, home ownership, and job stability, while lower-income households — particularly those earning under $100,000 annually and younger generations — are cutting back on discretionary spending due to inflation, stagnant wages, job insecurity, and rising rents.

People in households that bring in less than $100,000 a year drive about 40% of Chipotle’s sales.\n \n\n   \n  Another problem: 25- to 34-year-olds, who make up 25% of Chipotle’s sales, “pulled back meaningfully.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a component of a more discerning consumer, and I think most of it – the majority of it – is this massive pullback,” Boatwright said. “That household under $100,000 a year is pulling back.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, some consumers are spending like they’re from a completely different universe.\n \n\n   \n  Crocs CEO Andrew Rees noted that bifurcation on a call with analysts Thursday: “There is a portion of our North American consumers that are highly affluent. They’re buying Crocs, they’re buying other high-end brands and they are in great financial shape,” Rees said. “But there is a large portion of consumers who are nervous, they are in less-good financial shape and are being super cautious about their spending and certainly spending closer to need.”\n \n\n   \n  Or take Coke (to wash down your burrito). Coca-Cola’s Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun on a call last week with analysts said Coke’s earnings were boosted by strong demand for the company’s premium brands: Topo Chico, Smartwater and Fairlife.\n \n\n   \n  But Braun highlighted a successful two-pronged corporate strategy, noting the tough environment for lower-income consumers hasn’t changed – despite the growth in its high-end brands. That’s why Coke is also cutting sizes (and prices) on the lower end to drive sales – to “really tackle not only affordability but premiumization as well,” Braun said.\n \n\n   \n  “When we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said. “The pressure on middle- and low-end income consumers is still there.”\n \n\n   \n    The ‘K-shaped’ economy\n \n\n   \n  Economists call that phenomenon a “ K-shaped ” economy: Wealthier people are spending like nothing’s wrong. Lower-income people are making significant changes to preserve their finances.\n \n\n   \n  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell  addressed that concept  Wednesday in a media briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “On the K-shaped economy … if you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big public consumer-facing companies, many, many of them are saying there is a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not all anecdotal: Last month, Moody’s Analytics reported that the country’s top earners  are accounting for a growing share of overall spending .\n \n\n   \n  What’s causing that divide?\n \n\n   \n  Wealthier Americans are generally invested in the surging stock market, which has gained 17% this year. They have more job security than lower-income workers. And they own homes, which  keep appreciating  in the tight-supply market.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, less-affluent Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and their wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. If they lose their jobs, the cruddy labor market is preventing them from finding a new one – the number of Americans on unemployment insurance for multiple weeks recently surged to a  four-year high . And rents, until recently, had jumped as demand for rentals explodes – because so few homes have been on the market.\n \n\n   \n    What happens next?\n \n\n   \n  A K-shaped economy can be difficult to repair. America’s economy has been increasingly bifurcated for quite some time – with the exception of a few years following the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  During those post-pandemic years, government support for workers gave lower-income Americans a leg up. For the first time in a generation, the wealth gap narrowed.  Wages outpaced inflation , especially for lower-income workers. Interest rates were low, and homeowners refinanced like crazy to lock in historically low mortgage costs.\n \n\n   \n  But it was short-lived. The sugar rush of government stimulus checks wore off, and the economy resumed its previous trajectory. Mortgage rates rose to multi-decade highs. And, concerning for people who are getting left behind, the US government began pushing safety-net programs in the opposite direction, reducing benefits and increasing hurdles to access support.\n \n\n   \n  Those actions could widen that “K” in the future. Wider than you have to open your mouth to eat a Chipotle burrito.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/china/xi-trump-us-china-deal-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:50:00-04:50","title":"After Trump Trade Meeting, It’s Advantage Xi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a brief but impactful trade meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, China emerged with strategic advantages, including a 10% reduction in U.S. tariffs, a pause on a sweeping U.S. tech export blacklist, and a commitment to buy more U.S. soybeans.

meeting, it’s advantage Xi \n       \n  Analysis by Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:50 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the dust begins to clear around a  less-than-two hour meeting  between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump at an airbase in South Korea on Thursday, it’s clear that China’s leaders have stacked up another win for their hardball strategy with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting did not secure a broad trade deal, but rather a return to an uneasy truce built on a handful of agreements meant to keep the relationship steady as the two sides move toward one.\n \n\n   \n  Xi walked away with a 10% reduction in 30% tariffs newly imposed by Trump on Chinese goods this year – in exchange for   ramping up efforts to control its role in the US fentanyl crisis. He also secured US agreement to put on hold a new rule that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American tech.\n \n\n   \n  Trump averted Beijing imposing an expanded set of restrictions that could have hamstrung global industries reliant on China’s rare earths minerals. China will also ramp up purchases of US soybeans and other agricultural products, US officials said. Both sides also paused port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors and will extend a truce on more elevated tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  On paper, it looks like a reasonable exchange – and one that delivers, at least for now, what both leaders (and the wider global economy) wanted: stability after a tumultuous year of sparring between the world’s economic heavyweights.\n \n\n   \n  But for Beijing, the agreements – which came with a side of effusive praise from Trump for Xi – are also a clear confirmation of the success of its strategy in how to handle Trump 2.0.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Beijing has been able to win valuable concessions on tariffs and export controls, while primarily conceding measures they only put out as retaliation against those from the US in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  Take soybeans, a key American export that saw Chinese purchases plunge this year over trade frictions.\n \n\n   \n  China agreed to purchase a minimum of 25 million metric tons of American soybeans annually for the next three years, US agricultural secretary Brooke Rollins  said  after the talks.\n \n\n   \n  But that baseline is still 1.8 million metric tons less than China’s soybean purchases last year, before the tensions, according to  US data .\n \n\n   \n  China’s highly nationalistic and censor-curated internet clocked all this on Friday, when social media commenters praised how “China really nailed this tariff war,” and observed that “Trump finally dealt with the mess Trump created.”\n \n\n   \n    China’s game plan\n \n\n   \n  The outlook is not all rosy for China.\n \n\n   \n  Even as tariffs from this year’s US trade spat have been whittled down to 20%, Chinese exporters still face what on average amounts to nearly 50% duties on their goods, with pre-existing duties factored in. That rate remains among the highest imposed on any country by the US. Washington meanwhile has seen  real progress  on its goal to narrow their trade deficit.\n \n\n   \n  And, while the deal has yet to be inked, Beijing may have made some true concessions on the fate of the social media app TikTok, after changing its tune on staunch opposition to a US law requiring the app’s Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its US business.\n \n\n   \n  China also remains blocked from accessing the highest-end US chips, a key weapon in the high-stakes AI race playing out between the two countries.\n \n\n   \n  But on the tech front, Beijing’s ability to push back by at least a year the new US rule which would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American technologies, is a major boon for Chinese firms.\n \n\n   \n  The now-suspended US effort to close loopholes could have ensnared some 20,000 more companies than are already on the list, according to  an analysis  by business intelligence firm WireScreen.\n \n\n   \n  That’s another win for Beijing’s strategy of using its near-total grip on the global rare earths supply chain as leverage against the US – a tactic it also deployed during a tariff escalation earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  And on China’s side, agreeing to defer for at least a year its expanded export control regime on rare earth minerals, which it announced as retaliation for the US blacklist expansion, is unlikely to be seen as a major setback in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  As one Chinese scholar, foreign policy analyst Shen Dingli, told CNN earlier this month, those measures were a “nuclear” option that Beijing knew wasn’t symmetrical – “but if China doesn’t use this weapon, China has little left to bargain with.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether Xi and Trump can manage to keep the detente as they work toward a broader deal and expected visits to each other’s countries in 2026 is the next big question.\n \n\n   \n  Canada, after all, knows first-hand that a trade truce struck with Trump  can quickly collapse. \n \n\n   \n  A range of pitfalls, both foreseeable and unexpected, in the US and China’s expansive rivalry could derail the newly-reached stabilty – and whatever deal is ultimately reached is  unlikely to address the deep-seated, structural issues between the two. \n \n\n   \n  But as Trump took off from South Korea’s Gimhae International Airport on Thursday, to return to a US stuck in the quagmire of a frozen government,   Xi stayed on  to join an international summit and tout China as a beacon for globalization, it’s clear the balance of power between them has shifted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/top-election-campaign-ads","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The Top 10 Fall Campaign Ads of the 2025 Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the final weeks of the 2025 off-year election campaign, key state races in California, New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania have become focal points for high-stakes political advertising.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Voters in Virginia, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania have been inundated with campaign ads this year, with each state hosting critical off-year elections that offer a preview of the issues and arguments both parties are grappling with ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the ads getting the most spending during the critical final weeks of the off-year campaigns.\n \n\n   \n   (Note: Ads are ranked by committee spending between September 1 and October 27. CNN limited the list below to one advertisement per committee.) \n \n\n   \n    1. ‘Threatens,’ from opponents of California Democrats’ redistricting\n \n\n   \n  The top ad of the fall campaign season comes from the leading group opposing California Democrats’ redistricting push, “No on Prop 50: Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab.” Funded largely by Charles Munger Jr.,  a longtime supporter  of nonpartisan redistricting and heir of legendary investor Charles Munger, the group’s ad urges Californians to “protect your vote and democracy” and “vote No on Prop 50.” About $5 million has been spent on the ad so far, according to media tracking firm AdImpact. Opponents of the redistricting push have been splintered and  many are increasingly pessimistic  about Tuesday’s election.\n \n\n   \n    2. ‘Texts’ from Jason Miyares, Virginia’s Republican attorney general\n \n\n   \n   Violent text messages  sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, emerged as a lightning rod in Virginia’s off- campaigns, as Republicans have leaned into sharp criticism of Jones and linked him to other Democrats. “Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?” asks one ad from incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares, Jones’ Republican opponent.\n \n\n   \n    3. ‘Obama,’ from Gavin Newsom’s allied group for California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who has  staked significant political capital  on his state’s redistricting fight,  called in the 44th president  to help. “California, the whole nation is counting on you,” Barack Obama says in the ad.\n \n\n   \n    4. ‘Stick it to Trump,’ from Tom Steyer, backing California Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Financier Tom Steyer, a liberal mega-donor  who ran for president in 2020  and is eyeing California’s 2026 governor race,  waded into his state’s redistricting fight  earlier this month with a $12 million ad buy.  “You want to stick it to Trump? Vote yes on Prop 50,” one of his ads says. Steyer gave a boost to Democrats’ messaging campaign while also raising his profile ahead of a potential statewide run next year.\n \n\n   \n    5. ‘Predators,’ from supporters of Mikie Sherrill, Democrat running for New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s allies are running a spot accusing GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli of “voting against legislation that would protect children and young adults in cases of domestic and sexual violence,” according to a review of his record while serving in the state assembly compiled by  the New Jersey Independent . The ad warns, “Jack Ciattarelli should never be governor of New Jersey.” Ciattarelli’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the ad.\n \n\n   \n    6. ‘Day One,’ from Sherrill’s gubernatorial campaign\n \n\n   \n  One of Sherrill’s top campaign ads highlights her pledge to declare a state of emergency on utility costs on day one. Energy bills have  been a top issue  for New Jersey voters this year, with spiking utility rates and soaring demand on an aging grid. In New Jersey, residential rates have climbed by up to 20%, and the tri-state Regional Plan Association  found  that “increased demand from data centers is attributed to about two-thirds of the increased prices.”\n \n\n   \n    7. ‘Same But Worse,’ from Sherrill opponents\n \n\n   \n  Republicans, too, have honed in on energy bills as a key issue in the New Jersey’s gubernatorial race. Ciattarelli has argued Sherrill would continue policies from the outgoing administration of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy that he says contribute to the crunch. “More of the same, but worse,” Ciattarelli’s ad argues.\n \n\n   \n    8. ‘Protect Your Rights,’ from Democrats in Pennsylvania’s state supreme court vote\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 20 years since a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice lost a retention election. This fall,  three of the state’s liberal justices  are on the ballot. and Republicans are pressing for the chance to potentially flip the ideological balance of the battleground state high court. An ad from a Democratic group supporting the justices links the retention elections to abortion, saying the state Supreme Court is “our last line of defense.”\n \n\n   \n    9. ‘Speaking,’ from Abigail Spanberger, Democrat running for Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor of Virginia, has plastered voters’ screens with versions of an attack ad seizing on an unflattering moment from her rival, GOP nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. The ad splices clips of Earle-Sears declaring to a booing crowd, “I am speaking,” with criticism of Republican policies. “Winsome Earle-Sears is so far right, she’s wrong for Virginia,” the ad closes, echoing a Spanberger campaign refrain. (Earle-Sears  recently aired an ad  nodding to the “I am speaking” moment in which she says to the camera, “They pick your worst day.”)\n \n\n   \n    10. ‘Extreme Silence,’ from Spanberger opponents\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears and her Republican allies in the Virginia governor race have made transgender policies a focal point of their attack ads, criticizing Spanberger over her support for the Equality Act and pressing her for answers on youth sports and school bathrooms. An ad from one of the groups, Restoration of America PAC, claims Spanberger “is as extreme as it gets.” Spanberger has argued local school districts should decide their own youth participation policies.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/oakland-california-museum-theft","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00-04:00","title":"Over 1,000 Items Stolen from California Museum’s Collection in Early Morning Heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 1,000 historical and cultural items, including jewelry by artist Florence Resnikoff, Native American baskets, and 20th-century memorabilia, were stolen from the Oakland Museum of California’s off-site storage facility in the early morning of October 15, 2025.

October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Police in California are investigating the theft of more than 1,000 items from a museum’s collection including metalwork jewelry, Native American baskets and everyday items like athletic trophies that tell the story of the Golden State.\n \n\n   \n  The burglary occurred in the early morning hours of Oct. 15 at an off-site storage facility of the Oakland Museum of California, Oakland Police said in a news release Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Lori Fogarty, the museum’s director, said Thursday the investigation was going public because the artifacts might show up at flea markets, antique stores or pawn shops.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not just a loss to the museum,” she said. “They’re a loss to the public, to our community and we’re hoping our community can help us bring them home.”\n \n\n   \n  Fogarty said it appeared to be a crime of opportunity, and not a targeted art theft.\n \n\n   \n  “We think the thieves found a way to enter the building, and they grabbed what they could easily find and snatch and get out of the building with,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Stolen items include neckpieces by the late artist and metalsmith Florence Resnikoff, a pair of scrimshaw walrus tusks and Native American baskets. But she said much of it was historical memorabilia from the 20th century such as campaign pins and athletic awards.\n \n\n   \n  The mission of the Oakland Museum of California is to document the art, history and natural environment of California, and its collection includes works by California artists from the late 18th century to the present, a well as artifacts, photographs, natural specimens and sound recordings. The museum has mounted shows dedicated to the Black Power movement and student activism.\n \n\n   \n  John Romero, a retired Los Angeles Police Department captain who led the department’s commercial crimes unit, told the  Los Angeles Times  that the items may already have been sold since the burglary occurred two weeks ago. He expects detectives are looking at resale platforms such as Craigslist and Ebay, and networks that specialize in historic or collectible antiques.\n \n\n   \n  “These people are interested in fast cash, not the full appraisal value,” he told the Times. “They need to get rid of it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  In January 2013, an Oakland man broke into the museum itself and got away with a California Gold Rush-era jewelry box. Fogarty said the the item was traced to a pawn shop with help from the public, and she hopes the community can help again.\n \n\n   \n  The Oakland Police Department declined to provide further details, but said in its news release that police are working with a unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that specializes in art crime, including theft, forgery or antiquities and cultural property trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  The theft occurred four days before thieves made off with  priceless Napoleonic jewels  from the world’s most-visited museum, the Louvre, in broad daylight. Authorities have  made arrests  but the jewels have not been recovered.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/fbi-fires-agent-trump-investigations","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00.000Z","title":"FBI fires special agent who helped oversee Trump investigation, sources say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI has fired special agent Aaron Tapp, who previously oversaw investigations into former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including the Arctic Frost probe into fake electors.

investigation that became part of former special counsel Jack Smith’s probe into President Donald Trump, according to two sources familiar with the matter — another apparent casualty of the Trump administration’s retribution push.\n \n\n   \n  Aaron Tapp, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Antonio office, was previously the deputy assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters. There for a time he had oversight of probes into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  One of these investigations — known as Arctic Frost — focused on the fake electors scheme, in which Trump allies sought to have Trump electors counted as electoral college votes from states that Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Republicans have released FBI records showing details of the Arctic Frost investigation and accused Smith and FBI leaders of political motives in using grand jury subpoenas to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers. The records, obtained in 2023, covered four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot . The FBI didn’t obtain the contents of the calls. Smith has denied any political motives and said the subpoenas were routine investigative tools.\n \n\n   \n  Tapp has been with the FBI for more than 20 years, according to his bio on the FBI’s website.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the FBI’s headquarters and San Antonio field office for comment.\n \n\n   \n   Three former senior FBI officials summarily fired  in August are suing FBI Director Kash Patel and the Trump administration, alleging that their terminations were part of a White House-directed purge driven at least in part by social media bullying from MAGA loyalists, CNN reported last month.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Driscoll, the former acting FBI director for a month at the start of the second Trump administration; Steven Jensen, who Patel installed as assistant director in charge the Washington field office; and Spencer Evans, who led the Las Vegas field office, allege that Patel has politicized the FBI to protect his own job.\n \n\n   \n  “Patel not only acted unlawfully but deliberately chose to prioritize politicizing the FBI over protecting the American people,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  The 68-page complaint provided first-hand accounts from top FBI officials of the tumultuous first few weeks of Trump’s second term. Driscoll and other senior officials resisted efforts to try to fire or otherwise punish all FBI agents or employees for simply having worked on criminal investigations of Trump, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Patel and other officials, during Senate confirmation hearings, had dismissed any plans for political retribution, despite Trump’s repeated threats during his campaign rallies to do exactly that.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/middleeast/israel-receives-remains-hostages-gaza-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:02:00-04:00","title":"Israel receives remains of two deceased hostages held in Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel received the remains of two deceased hostages, Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, from Gaza on October 31, 2025, through the Red Cross, marking a step forward in the ongoing efforts to return hostages under the US-brokered ceasefire.

He was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His family was notified in June 2024 that he was killed in captivity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said he was was killed in captivity around February of last year.\n \n\n   \n  Cooper was the last remaining hostage from Nir Oz, one of the communities hardest hit during the initial attack two years ago, whose body had not been returned. “We will always remember Amiram as a man of people and of words, a pioneer with values, a person of initiative and ideas who so deeply loved the kibbutz and its members,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Baruch, 25, was also taken hostage during the October 7 attack from his mother’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri. Baruch’s brother and grandmother were killed in the attack. Two months later, Baruch was killed in Gaza during a failed rescue attempt. “In this difficult and painful moment, we hope the family can find a measure of comfort in the closing of a horrific circle of 755 days and nights,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s transfer leaves the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional development.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/wnba-players-union-cba-extension","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00-10:17","title":"WNBA and Players Union Agree to 30-Day Extension for CBA Negotiations, AP Source Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The WNBA and players union have agreed to a 30-day extension of their collective bargaining agreement negotiations, pushing the deadline from October 30 to November 30, 2025.

weeks as the sides try to work toward a new deal.\n \n\n   \n  The new Nov. 30 deadline gives the sides more time to come up with a new deal that would be transformational for the players in terms of salary.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  We’re just days away from 2025’s off-year elections. Beyond how the races themselves turn out, the contests will be a valuable source of data to analyze – and perhaps overanalyze – ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s an overview of what the polls suggest about the four big races we’re watching this year.\n \n\n   \n  A note: Polls are a valuable tool for understanding the electorate, but they’re most useful when they’re treated as estimates rather than attempts to predict the future with pinpoint precision. Often, what they tell us about the broader political environment is more valuable than the exact margin that any specific survey finds for a race.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia statewide races\n \n\n   \n   Virginia’s election for governor  takes place in the shadow of an unpopular GOP administration in Washington, DC.  A Washington Post-Schar School poll  asked voters to describe the most important issue in the race. The share who responded with negative comments about President Donald Trump or Republicans came second only to concerns about economic issues and the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  The Post-Schar poll, which found Democrat Abigail Spanberger with a 12-point lead over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears among likely voters, joins  other recent   surveys  in the state that show Spanberger with a stable advantage in the race. There’s much more uncertainty in the other statewide races, particularly the campaign for attorney general, where polls show support for Democrat Jay Jones facing some erosion after  the publication of text messages  in which he fantasized about killing a legislative colleague.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey’s gubernatorial race  is a tale of two incumbents: Trump is unpopular there as well, but the state’s outgoing Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, also draws closely divided ratings for his time in office. Many recent surveys of the race, including polls from  Quinnipiac University ,  F ox News,   Fairleigh Dickinson University  and the  Rutgers-Eagleton Poll , have found Democrat Mikie Sherrill with an edge among likely voters, hovering around the 50% mark, while her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, stands closer to 45%.\n \n\n   \n  Quinnipiac’s latest poll, like several others, found that Ciattarelli’s supporters were more likely than Sherrill’s to express strong enthusiasm about their chosen candidate, although Sherrill’s favorability ratings remained higher overall.\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n   New York City’s multi-candidate mayoral race  poses a unique challenge for pollsters. Surveys of likely voters, however, have been largely consistent in showing Democrat Zohran Mamdani with a double-digit lead over his nearest rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with Republican Curtis Sliwa in third. They differ on the precise scope of Mamdani’s advantage, although most have found him shy of clearing a majority of support in the race.\n \n\n   \n  In polls released Thursday by  Marist College  and  Fox News , Mamdani was buoyed by positive favorability ratings and broad support among younger voters, while older voters broke for Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n    California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps nowhere is the role of national politics as clear as in California, where  voters are weighing Proposition 50 , a ballot measure to temporarily enact a new congressional map drawn by Democrats in response to Republican-driven redistricting in other states.\n \n\n   \n  A mid-October poll from  CBS/YouGov  found 62% of likely voters in support of Proposition 50, while  an October Public Policy Institute of California poll  put that support at 56%. It’s worth noting that  past research has found  that polling sometimes overshoots support for initiatives that implement new changes – whether liberal or conservative – because some voters default to preferring the status quo.\n \n\n   \n  Half of likely voters said in the CBS/YouGov poll that their decision had more to do with national issues and politics than with state or local issues. Broad majorities of likely voters supporting Proposition 50 said their choice was driven by the desire to oppose Trump, to oppose national Republicans and to support national Democrats.\n \n\n   \n    A note on the state of polling\n \n\n   \n  How have polls been performing lately? A  new postmortem report on 2024 election polling , released Wednesday by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, found that polling in last year’s election was significantly more accurate than it was in 2020 or 2016 even as it continued to underestimate Republican vote shares for the third straight presidential cycle. (Polls in the 2022 and 2018 midterms both saw smaller directional errors.)\n \n\n   \n  As the report also noted, polls last year weren’t always able to estimate the ways that turnout changed between 2020 and 2024. That bears mentioning because all of these surveys reflect pollsters’ best estimations about who’s likely to end up voting in an off-year election – and how much that might differ from four years ago, at the start of former President Joe Biden’s administration.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/andrew-cuomo-mamdani-nyc-mayor-race","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-04:00","title":"In his last stand, Andrew Cuomo zigzags between optimism and despair about NYC race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the final stretch of the 2025 New York City mayoral campaign, Andrew Cuomo, former governor and now a mayoral candidate, attempts to regain public trust by emphasizing his extensive executive experience and contrasting it with Zohran Mamdani’s progressive, digital-native campaign.

\n        8:54 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Through the final days of this year’s campaign for New York City mayor, Andrew Cuomo has at times lived up to the nickname he earned in the early days of his political career: the prince of darkness.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo  relaunched his mayoral campaign  after his shocking Democratic primary loss, telling New Yorkers he was in it to win it in a video he filmed standing on a tree-lined sidewalk under the July sun. He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism about his candidacy and despair about the  possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani . He has described his run as the last chance New Yorkers will have to save the city from Mamdani’s  democratic socialism , once referring in a debate to the 34-year-old Mamdani as a “kid” and warning that his ideas were radical and unrealistic.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s final general election ad leans on his executive experience and also questions whether Mamdani has enough.\n \n\n   \n  “Life in New York is tough right now,” he says in the ad. “Candidates who need on-the-job training can’t fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s election, early voting numbers were up dramatically ahead of the same point in 2021, reflecting the interest New Yorkers have in a mayoral race unlike any in recent memory. The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  And in a  new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters  released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 16%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.\n \n\n   \n  The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).\n \n\n   \n  Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he  laughed with a radio host  who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11. Cuomo  later said  he believed the host’s comments were offensive as Mamdani accused him of playing to Islamophobia.\n \n\n   \n  Days later, during an appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” host Jon Stewart joked with Mamdani about their back-and-forth.\n \n\n   \n  “You are clearly in the front-runner position right now – I can tell because they have gone 9/11 on you,” Stewart said eliciting laughter from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “The closing argument,” Mamdani responded.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo reframes his legacy\n \n\n   \n  With every post and campaign stop, Cuomo tried a new media strategy while leaning into the legacy items of his 11 years as governor, including  legalizing same-sex marriage  and  raising the minimum wage . In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”\n \n\n   \n   Cuomo resigned  in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.\n \n\n   \n  He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat whose district includes parts of Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America,” Suozzi  wrote on X . “We need leaders who will fight crime, not undermine the police. Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”\n \n\n   \n    Embracing his inner influencer\n \n\n   \n  As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.\n \n\n   \n  Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective.

  Zohran Mamdani  on Tuesday responded to a widely shared 2023 clip in which he suggested that the New York Police Department and Israeli army were linked in oppression, the latest example of the Democratic mayoral nominee  facing questions about his past record  of anti-police and anti-Israel statements.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it’s been laced by the IDF,” Mamdani says in the clip, from a Democratic Socialists of America convention held that year. The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, are the armed forces of Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make, not specifically that example all the time, but just to say that for working-class people who have very little time, who have so many stresses, who are under so many pressures, there isn’t that much time for symbolism,” he then said. “We have to make it materially connected to their life.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Anderson Cooper played that clip Tuesday and asked Mamdani what he meant.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a reference to training exercises that have taken place between the NYPD and the IDF,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  “So do you still believe that the NYPD is basically working hand in glove with the IDF?” Cooper asked.\n \n\n   \n  “No, what I’ve made very clear is those are training exercises that are of concern to me,” Mamdani replied. “And what my focus is, is on working with the NYPD to actually deliver public safety for New Yorkers across the five boroughs.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mamdani would seek as mayor to end any training exercises or other cooperation between the NYPD and Israel. But the clip – and Mamdani’s explanation of it – became the latest instance during the mayoral campaign where the Democratic nominee had to answer for his past criticisms of both Israel and the police.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has apologized for some of his comments about law enforcement, including social media posts in which he called the police racist, wicked and corrupt. Seeking to reassure voters concerned about public safety, he has said he would seek to retain NYPD Commissioner  Jessica Tisch , though he acknowledged in an earlier interview with CNN’s Gloria Pazmino that he hadn’t spoken to Tisch about staying on.\n \n\n   \n  But he has not backed down on his criticisms of Israel, referring to its war in Gaza after Hamas’ October 7 attacks as a genocide. He has said that as mayor, he would seek to carry out an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  While Americans are  increasingly skeptical  of Israel’s actions in Gaza, Mamdani’s criticisms have caused anger within parts of New York’s Jewish community, the largest outside Israel. He has  sought to reassure  Jewish voters that he would fight antisemitism and provide requested security at synagogues.\n \n\n   \n  While the NYPD does not have international posts in the traditional sense, the department runs an “International Liaison Program” that stations detectives across more than a dozen countries around the globe with the purpose of developing contacts with local law enforcement and engaging in counterterrorism exercises, according to the New York City police foundation that helps fund the program.\n \n\n   \n  The program, which critics say has expanded for years with little oversight, was started after 9/11 as law enforcement professionals sought to learn more about overseas terrorism.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, the NYPD has continued to deploy senior law enforcement officers around the world, including to Israel, where they share in intelligence and training exercises.\n \n\n   \n  The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/tech/amazon-layoffs-andy-jassy-ai-culture","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00Z","title":"Amazon Says It Didn’t Cut 14,000 People Because of Money.

Previous studies have suggested that male fetal brains are more susceptible to maternal immune responses, according to the authors of the new study, and the third trimester is a “critical window for brain development.”\n \n\n   \n  The most common diagnoses included disorders in speech and motor function development and autism. About 2.7% of children born to mothers who had Covid-19 while pregnant were diagnosed with autism, compared with about 1.1% of others, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n \n\n   \n  The new findings are “particularly notable in light of their biological plausibility,” the researchers wrote. They build on previous research that identified potential pathways for a maternal Covid-19 infection to affect the developing fetal brain even without direct transmission.\n \n\n   \n  “Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Dr. Lydia Shook, maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in  a news release .\n \n\n   \n  About 1 in 31 children in the US was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, according to a  report  published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in April. The increase — up from 1 in 36 children in 2020 — continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched a “massive testing and research effort” to determine “what has  caused the autism epidemic .”\n \n\n   \n  In a news conference in September on the “ cause of autism ,” President Donald Trump — flanked by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal health leaders – said that use of  Tylenol during pregnancy  can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy also has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence that the two are not connected.\n \n\n   \n  The timeframe of the new study – early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available – meant that ​the researchers were able to “isolate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and offspring neurodevelopment in an unvaccinated population.” About 93% of the mothers included in the assessment had not received any doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Strong infection-control policies at that time also helped reduce the potential for unreported or undetected Covid-19 cases, the researchers said.\n \n\n   \n  “These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development,” Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham and senior author of the new study, said in a news release. “They also support the importance of trying to prevent COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and are particularly relevant when public trust in vaccines – including the COVID-19 vaccine – is being eroded.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/salem-britain-witches-pardon-campaign-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Salem’s witches were pardoned, but Britain’s weren’t.

but Britain’s weren’t. There’s now a movement to change that \n       \n  By James Frater, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While the women accused in the infamous  Salem witch  trials in colonial America have long since been pardoned, the convictions of hundreds of British women executed under similar laws officially still stand. Now, one local authority in southern England is campaigning to change that.\n \n\n   \n  Decades before Salem, hysteria over witchcraft was already sweeping through England – and perhaps nowhere more fervently than in the southeast, such as in the neighboring counties of Kent and Essex, which border London.\n \n\n   \n  Between 1560 and 1700, more than 500 women were tried for witchcraft in the southeast region, according to UK Parliament estimates. Of those, 112 were executed.\n \n\n   \n  But one trial in Maidstone, Kent, in 1652 stands out for its scale and public fascination.\n \n\n   \n  On July 30 that year, a court convened near where Maidstone Town Hall stands today. Thirty-two people faced charges ranging from theft and murder to witchcraft, Claire Kehily, councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. Six women, accused of bewitching to death a 10-day-old infant, her mother, and a 3-year-old child, became the focus of the town’s attention, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In the summer of 1652, the town was “abuzz with excitement,” Kehily explained.  “People came down from London to witness what was going on. It was the biggest thing we’d had here for a long time.”\n \n\n   \n  The accused were held in a small, dark jail that once stood on the ground floor of the courthouse, now tucked away in the attic of the rebuilt Town Hall.\n \n\n   \n  The trial’s notoriety was such that a special pamphlet was published shortly after, titled “A Prodigious and Tragic History of the Arraignment, Trial, Confession, and Condemnation of Six Witches,” of which Maidstone Council has a rare replica.\n \n\n   \n  The document describes bizarre and unverified claims – including one woman swelling “into a monstrous and vast bigness” before the court and another allegedly bearing “a visible teat under her tongue.”\n \n\n   \n  Three women were convicted after failing a crude test: a pin thrust into their arms. The court account said the women “did not feel it, neither did it draw blood.”\n \n\n   \n  Two others confessed to being impregnated “not by any man, but by the devil,” according to the document.\n \n\n   \n  All six were convicted of “the execrable and diabolical crime of witchcraft” and sentenced to death.\n \n\n   \n    Spectacle of execution\n \n\n   \n  Their execution took place at Penenden Heath, now a tranquil park with soccer fields and woodland.\n \n\n   \n  “They were dragged on hurdles – basically carts – to the heath,” Tony Harwood, a councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. “Thousands came to watch. Public executions were entertainment, but also a tool of control.”\n \n\n   \n  “These were women of all ages,” Harwood continued. “Very vulnerable individuals who had no idea what was going on or why they had been put into this situation. You just have to understand the absolute terror of these events – and that is partly what’s behind it. The powers that be wanted to instil terror.”\n \n\n   \n  Harwood described the horror and spectacle of the scene. “Public executions – they were public participation events. Thousands of people would attend. There were crime waves around them: pickpocketing, thefts, lots of complaints. That’s why the execution spot at Penenden Heath was moved several times – because of the impact from the many thousands of sightseers who came to watch,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “There would have been people who were just there for the show. There would have been people who were appalled by what was going on. There would have been people who were excited by it.”\n \n\n   \n  After the executions, the bodies were discarded without ceremony. “When roads were widened or housing built, human remains have often been found,” Harwood added.\n \n\n   \n  A small stone plaque on the edge of Penenden Heath that commemorates these women – alongside the plaques for the many other people executed at this site – is the only mark of the atrocities that took place.\n \n\n   \n    Seeking justice, centuries later\n \n\n   \n  Though the frenzy surrounding witchcraft in England faded in the decades following the Maidstone trial, and all laws criminalizing witchcraft have long since been repealed, the convictions of those women – and hundreds like them – still stand.\n \n\n   \n  Now, nearly 400 years later, Maidstone Borough Council is calling for change.\n \n\n   \n  Stuart Jeffery, leader of the council, has written to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, urging the British government to introduce legislation that would grant a general pardon to those executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1562, including the women hanged at Penenden Heath in 1652.\n \n\n   \n  “Justice is timeless,” said Harwood. “These terrible wrongs carried out between 1542 and the mid-18th century echo through the ages. They cannot just be painted over.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to set the record straight. These were innocent, vulnerable individuals who were brutally judicially murdered – often for political or personal gain. That injustice will echo down the ages.”\n \n\n   \n  Kehily said that the trials were “a very early form of violence against women and girls. It still happens. They were scapegoats.”\n \n\n   \n  “By highlighting it, we remind people that this has happened – and we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “To address a wrong that has been made,” Kehily said, “is to try and get it right, to learn from history, and to bring it to the fore. This hasn’t gone away.”\n \n\n   \n    Precedents for pardon\n \n\n   \n  Maidstone’s campaign follows similar efforts elsewhere in the United Kingdom to confront historical injustices.\n \n\n   \n  In Scotland, then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a formal apology in 2022 to the thousands of people – mostly women – who were accused and executed under the country’s Witchcraft Act between the 16th and 18th centuries. The apology came after a sustained campaign by historians and activists who argued that the victims were persecuted for being poor, vulnerable, or simply different.\n \n\n   \n  There is also precedent for legislative pardons.\n \n\n   \n  In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II posthumously pardoned Alan Turing, the World War II codebreaker convicted under laws criminalizing homosexuality, and in 2017 the UK government extended the pardon to thousands of other gay and bisexual men convicted under similar statutes. Known as the “Turing Law,” it marked a significant step in acknowledging the injustice of discriminatory legislation.\n \n\n   \n  Councillors in Maidstone hope that a similar approach can be taken to address the legacy of the Witchcraft Act.\n \n\n   \n  “This is about justice,” Harwood said. “We’ve seen the government take steps to right past wrongs. Now it’s time to do the same for the women who were judicially murdered under the guise of witchcraft.”\n \n\n   \n  A Home Office spokesperson told CNN the government would respond to the council’s letter “in due course.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/shutdown-snap-trump-asia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:47:00-04:00","title":"Trump returns to confront deepening duel of pain as shutdown drags on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government shutdown is reaching its most severe phase, with millions of Americans facing rising health care premiums and the potential loss of food assistance under SNAP.

Lisa Murkowski said this week, berating her colleagues in both parties for failing to act. “We’re pretending that people are not being impacted by this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the showdown, withholding support for a temporary government funding bill last month in an attempt to force Republicans to guarantee extensions for  expanded subsidies  for millions of  Affordable Care Act health plans .\n \n\n   \n  “They are completely and totally uninterested in solving or addressing, decisively, the Republican health care crisis that they’ve created,” House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Wednesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “On November 1, when open enrollment begins, it’s going to be crystal clear to tens of millions of Americans, across the country, that their premiums, copays and deductibles are about to dramatically increase,” Jeffries said.\n \n\n   \n  But Republican leaders are standing firm. They’re offering to discuss extending the credits, but only when Democrats agree to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  A pitiful lack of trust between the parties, the unwillingness of either side to accept the political cost of a climbdown and Trump’s stunning indifference to his own shuttered government led to this stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  And the ramifications of the shutdown are getting quickly worse as the political duel becomes a test of which unfortunate Americans can bear the most pain.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most critical developments, tens of millions of Americans, including children, elderly citizens and those with a disability are set to lose vital food assistance under the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \n \n\n   \n  The blow of soaring health care premiums is also being laid bare. Millions are getting notices showing Obamacare costs shooting up by an average of 26% and in some cases much higher, in the absence of the expiring enhanced subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Which pain point is the worst?” Collins asked Jeffries, referring to Americans hit by rising Obamacare premiums and those facing the potential loss of SNAP benefits. “None of this pain that Republicans have inflicted on the American people is acceptable,” Jeffries replied.\n \n\n   \n  The pressure on government workers — those forced to work without pay and colleagues who are locked out of their jobs — is also worsening.\n \n\n   \n  Flight disruptions are mounting as staff shortages emerge among air traffic controllers, who already operate  under acute stress . The controllers’ mental and emotional challenges are rising since they are  working without pay  — but still face housing, transport and childcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  A new crisis speed bump looms over paying military personnel. Trump accepted a  $130 million donation  from a fellow billionaire to fill the gap left by drained federal funds after reallocating Pentagon funds to meet a first wave of salary payments. But the gift won’t come close to paying wages for 1.3 million military members.\n \n\n   \n  Federal employees, who are spread throughout the 50 states, are getting increasingly desperate. Their financial obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.\n \n\n   \n    Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?\n \n\n   \n  Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.\n \n\n   \n  ► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?\n \n\n   \n  ► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line? Will they risk political fallout from all this misery inflicted on voters already hit by rising inflation and grocery prices, given they have a monopoly on power in Washington?\n \n\n   \n  ► And will Trump, who has managed to defray some of the traditional pressure points during a shutdown, finally discover a political or moral imperative to end it?\n \n\n   \n    A hint of hope as senators talk\n \n\n   \n  A glimmer of hope shone late on Wednesday when details emerged of a  dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators . One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.\n \n\n   \n  Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”\n \n\n   \n  The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue. And after nearly a year of internal mourning over the disastrous 2024 congressional and presidential elections, they found surprising unity in the shutdown. Sometimes, just picking a fight can give a party definition.\n \n\n   \n  But as the pain for millions of Americans mounted, the political clarity over health care blurred. And competing claims emerged. Everett Kelley, the president of the  American Federation of Government Employees  union that represents a wide swath of federal workers, who always opposed a shutdown, warned that it was time for the government to reopen. “I think that it’s vitally important to have health care for everyone … However, I don’t think that this should be built on the backs of federal employees,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are also increasingly wrestling with the possibility that blame for the shutdown could blow back against them. After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans face their own risks.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness. And he hasn’t been able to silence dissent in his conference, including from  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , who keeps accusing her party of negligence over the health care issue. The political equation could shift for Republicans next week if Trump is rebuked in  bellwether elections in Virginia and New Jersey .\n \n\n   \n  And leaving kids hungry could be a disaster. That’s one reason  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to fund SNAP benefits  until the end of the shutdown. Schumer said his party would vote for it. But Republican leaders will be loath to make a move that could alleviate pressure on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If millions of Americans going hungry doesn’t break open the deadlock, the shutdown could drag on even longer. The next potential off-ramp may come in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving with the horrible prospect of an air travel nightmare at the busiest time of the year.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/mississippi-police-drug-trafficking-charged","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:46:00Z","title":"2 Mississippi Sheriffs and 12 Officers Charged in Drug Trafficking Bribery Scheme","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal authorities have indicted 20 individuals, including two Mississippi sheriffs—Washington County Sheriff Milton Gaston and Humphreys County Sheriff Bruce Williams—allegedly involved in a drug trafficking bribery scheme where they accepted bribes ranging up to $37,000 to provide armed escorts to help transport 25 kilograms of cocaine through the Mississippi Delta region.

\n  Federal authorities on Thursday announced indictments against 20 people, including 14 current or former Mississippi Delta law enforcement officers, who allegedly took bribes to provide safe passage to people they believed were drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  The yearslong investigation swept across multiple counties in the Mississippi Delta region of Mississippi and Tennessee. Two Mississippi sheriffs, Washington County Sheriff Milton Gaston and Humphreys County Sheriff Bruce Williams, were among those arrested.\n \n\n   \n  Some bribes were as large as $20,000 and $37,000, authorities said at a news conference.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just a monumental betrayal of public trust,” US Attorney Clay Joyner said.\n \n\n   \n  The indictments say law enforcement officers provided armed escort services on multiple occasions to an FBI agent posing as a member of a Mexican drug cartel. The indictments allege the officers understood they were helping to transport 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of cocaine through Mississippi Delta counties and into Memphis. Some of the officers also provided escort services to protect the transportation of drug proceeds.\n \n\n   \n  Gaston and Williams are alleged to have received bribes in exchange for giving the operations their “blessing,” one indictment said. It also alleged that Gaston attempted to disguise the payments as campaign contributions, but did not report them as required by law.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials said the investigation into the alleged crimes began when people who had been arrested complained about having to pay bribes to various individuals.\n \n\n   \n  “Law enforcement is only effective when the community they protect can trust the law enforcement officers are honestly serving the community’s interests,” Robert Eikhoff, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Jackson Field Office, said. “This type of corruption strikes at the heart of the community.”\n \n\n   \n  Nineteen of the 20 people indicted are also charged with violating federal gun laws.\n \n\n   \n  Court records show that the federal defender’s office is representing 16 of the 20 people charged, including the two sheriffs. That office did not immediately respond to an after-hours email Thursday evening seeking comment on the charges.\n \n\n   \n  Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said in a statement that he was disappointed to learn of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “The law must apply equally to everyone regardless of the title or position they hold,” he wrote. “Know that if you betray the people’s trust in Mississippi, you will face consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Multiple Mississippi law enforcement agencies and sheriffs have faced federal scrutiny in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, the former Hinds County Sheriff Marshand Crisler was  convicted  of accepting $9,500 in bribes and knowingly providing ammunition to a convicted felon. The same year, former Noxubee County Sheriff Terry Grassaree pleaded guilty to  making false statements  to the FBI while being questioned about requesting and receiving nude photos from a female inmate.\n \n\n   \n  William Brewer, a former Tallahatchie County sheriff, was sentenced to  six years  in prison in 2019 for extorting bribes   from a drug dealer.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023, six law enforcement officers pleaded guilty to state and federal charges for  torturing two Black men , a case that sparked a  Department of Justice investigation  into the Rankin County Sheriff’s Office.

investigating fraud allegations in Black Lives Matter movement, AP sources say \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:15 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department is investigating whether leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement defrauded donors who contributed tens of millions of dollars during racial justice protests in 2020, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, federal law enforcement officials have issued subpoenas and at least one search warrant as part of an investigation into the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. and other Black-led organizations that helped spark a national reckoning on systemic racism, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss an ongoing criminal probe by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  It was not clear if the investigation would result in criminal charges, but its mere existence invites fresh scrutiny to a movement that in recent years has faced criticism about its public accounting of donations received. The recent burst of investigative activity is also unfolding at a time when civil rights groups have raised concerns about the potential for the Trump administration to target a broad variety of progressive and left-leaning groups that have been critical of him, including those affiliated with BLM, the transgender rights movement and anti-ICE protesters.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for the Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people said the investigation had been initiated during the Biden administration but is getting renewed attention during the Trump administration. A second person confirmed that allegations were examined in the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  The foundation said it  took in over $90 million in donations , following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose last breaths under the knee of a White Minneapolis police officer sparked protests across the US and around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the nonprofit foundation, and of the BLM movement broadly, have accused organizers of not being transparent about how it was spending the donations. That criticism grew louder after BLM foundation leaders in 2022 confirmed they used donations to purchase  a $6 million Los Angeles-area property  that includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders previously have denied wrongdoing and publicly released tax documents. No prior investigations into the nonprofit’s finances have yielded proof of impropriety.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation have received subpoenas. In a statement emailed to the AP on Thursday, the foundation said it “is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  “We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,” the foundation said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Black Lives Matter movement first emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old  Trayvon Martin  in Florida. But it was the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, that made the slogan “Black lives matter” a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives.\n \n\n   \n  Movement founders and organizers pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus of BLM chapters. But as the movement’s influence grew, so did the number of organizations that became affiliated with BLM. In 2020, a tidal wave of public contributions in the aftermath of protests over Floyd’s murder came mainly to the BLM foundation, although other organizations were resourced from those funds.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation  opened up about finances and organizational structure in 2022 , revealing detailed accountings of expenditures. The latest Form 990 filing shows the BLM foundation had $28 million in assets for the fiscal year ending June 2024.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation is being run out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles. The top prosecutor there, Bill Essayli, was  disqualified from several cases  earlier this week after a federal judge concluded that the Trump appointee has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law. It’s not clear whether Essayli’s disqualification will impact the BLM investigation. He effectively remains the office’s top prosecutor with a different title of First Assistant United States Attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Essayli had previously served as a Republican assemblyman in California, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s Covid-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against state policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California.\n \n\n   \n  As a private practice attorney, he characterized BLM as a “radical organization” while defending a White couple charged in 2020 with a hate crime after they were videotaped defacing  a BLM mural in Martinez, California .\n \n\n   \n  At the time,  city-sanctioned BLM murals had been painted on roadways  in cities throughout the US in an expression of solidarity with the racial justice movement. Essayli told a San Francisco CBS TV affiliate his clients were simply expressing their political viewpoints and that they disagreed with taxpayer funds being used to “sponsor a radical organization, Black Lives Matters.”\n \n\n   \n  The couple took plea deals to resolve the case in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  At the height of the Floyd-sparked reckoning on racial injustice, some state officials vowed their own investigations in the foundation’s finances, citing their responsibility to protect residents who may have donated to BLM. But most of those probes were resolved without official action.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed a lawsuit against the BLM foundation for failing to comply with an investigation into the organization’s finances. Soon after, a representative of the foundation responded with the necessary information and documentation, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said, and the lawsuit was dismissed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/fetterman-democrats-shutdown-snap","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:26:00Z","title":"Fetterman rails on his colleagues for not getting their ‘sh*t together’ with SNAP on the line amid the shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the fifth week of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, U.S. Senator John Fetterman from Pennsylvania expresses outrage at his colleagues for failing to reopen the government, warning that millions of Americans—including 2 million on SNAP and over 400,000 on Affordable Care Act tax credits—will lose critical support this weekend.

John Fetterman was exasperated with his colleagues Thursday, as the Senate heads home in the stalemate’s fifth week and millions of Americans are due to lose federal food assistance this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month, and now things are really going to land, and imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” the Pennsylvania Democrat told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman said his wife helps distribute free food to the community and has already witnessed longer lines. He lamented that when he returns home this weekend, he’ll have to tell constituents who have lost their SNAP benefits, “I don’t have an explanation for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The Democrat, who  has been outspoken  against shutting down the government in any form, has been one of just three in his caucus to routinely break from the party and vote with Republicans more than a dozen times to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate left town on Thursday for the weekend with no measurable progress toward a deal to reopen the government, with impatience inside the US Capitol skyrocketing and  critical social safety net programs at risk  in the coming days. Senators will not return until Monday, which will mark day 34 of the shutdown – just two days shy of setting a new record for longest shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Key senators of both parties took part in some private meetings Thursday to discuss potential off-ramps, including how to get both parties to support a deal on long-term appropriations bills. But lawmakers involved in those talks offered no more clarity about whether it could indeed end the standoff.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the effort by some Senate Democrats to pass a bill to temporarily extend SNAP benefits, Fetterman questioned why Congress couldn’t also pay Capitol police officers, saying that “the world’s biggest lethal military in the world has relied on a donor to pay our service members last week. I mean, that’s a disgrace.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to find a way forward,” the senator said. He added that while he “fundamentally” believes there will be an effort to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, as his fellow Democrats are demanding, his party must also consider those who receive other important benefits from the government.\n \n\n   \n  “You have 2 million people on SNAP in my state, and over 400,000 are receiving those kind of tax credits,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “For a Democrat, I can’t imagine a more sacred part of who we fight for is people that, that depend on SNAP to feed themselves,” he said, later adding, “Our party has bigger problems than I thought we might have already. It’s like that’s not controversial. Pay everybody.”\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t even get our shit together and just open up our government,” he lamented.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s prior suggestion that each day of the shutdown plays better politically for Democrats, Fetterman responded, “Ask the hungry people on Saturday.”\n \n\n   \n  “Americans are not leverage.

Caribbean as it tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds unleashed widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. At least 30 people have died, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  As the hurricane headed toward Bermuda early Thursday, emergency officials in countries along Melissa’s path have begun to pick up the pieces – clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica, traveled to some of the hardest-hit areas of the island nation Wednesday to survey the significant damage caused by punishing winds and widespread flooding.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the difficulties, the Jamaican spirit shines through as a strong reminder that we are a resilient nation with the capacity to triumph over adversity,” he wrote  on social media .\n \n\n   \n    Path of destruction\n \n\n   \n  In the Caribbean, hotter-than-average waters paired with minimally disruptive winds higher in the atmosphere to create the perfect fuel and prime conditions for Melissa to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa rapidly  intensified , jumping from a 70 mph tropical storm on Saturday morning to a 140 mph Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning.\n \n\n   \n  By Tuesday, Melissa had morphed into a high-end Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, tying it with  four other hurricanes  as the second-strongest storm recorded in the Atlantic since records began in 1851.\n \n\n   \n  As it headed toward Jamaica, where it slammed into the coast as a Category 5 storm on Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned it expected the situation to be “catastrophic.”\n \n\n   \n  “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,” WMO tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said.\n \n\n   \n  Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, it crossed into eastern Cuba, still a formidable Category 3 hurricane by the time it made landfall in the province of Santiago de Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  By the time it reached the Bahamas on Wednesday, Hurricane Melissa had been downgraded to a Category 1, but its broad wind field continued to drive torrential flooding rain, damaging winds and dangerous storm surge at the coast.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were  evacuated in Cuba  as Melissa approached, according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel, while in the Bahamas, preliminary estimates show 1,485 residents were evacuated before all flights were suspended ahead of the approaching storm.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders were also issued for six islands in the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, also felt the cataclysmic impacts of Melissa.\n \n\n   \n    Devastation left behind\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, officials painted a consistent picture of the destruction Melissa left behind.\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions here are devastating. ‘Catastrophic’ is a mild term based on what we are observing here,” Richard Solomon, the mayor of the southwest Jamaican city of Black River, where Hurricane Melissa made landfall, said in a  video  posted by the Jamaica Constabulary Force.\n \n\n   \n  Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government has said.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel push more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Holness  declared  the country a disaster area   Tuesday, as he sought to deter price gouging.\n \n\n   \n  “We must… continue to proactively maintain stability, protect consumers, and prevent any exploitation at a time when citizens are securing food, water, and supplies,” Holness said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 77% of the country was  left  without electricity after Melissa crossed, a spokesperson said. The country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister of local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, Dana Morris Dixon, minister of education, skills, youth and information, said in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  In the already  beleaguered  country of Haiti, 23 people have died and 13 are missing, the country’s Civil Protection Agency said Wednesday. Twenty of the deaths, including 10 children, happened when a flooded river in Petit-Goâve burst its banks, the agency said, revising an earlier death toll of 25 reported by the mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said Hurricane Melissa had wrought “significant” damage on the island.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been a highly complex night, with significant damage reported,” Díaz-Canel wrote on X. “I urge our people to remain vigilant, to uphold discipline, and to continue taking all necessary precautions.”\n \n\n   \n    Recovery efforts\n \n\n   \n  Several international efforts have already been launched to aid in the recovery efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump on Wednesday authorized “an immediate US response” to mobilize support for affected communities in the Caribbean, according to a  statement  released by the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Within hours, Secretary of State Marco Rubio “deployed a regional Disaster Assistance Response Team, including urban search-and-rescue teams, to assess needs and provide search and recovery assistance,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  “The State Department is collaborating with UN agencies, NGOs, and host governments to deliver food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits, temporary shelter, and search and rescue support.”\n \n\n   \n  The Jamaican government launched an  official website  for relief and recovery efforts, where users can access updates on flooding locations or blocked roads and locate shelters.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-checks-into-prison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:56:00-04:00","title":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs Checks Into Fort Dix to Begin Prison Sentence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs, the renowned music mogul, has been transferred to Fort Dix, a low-security federal prison in New Jersey, to begin serving the remainder of his 50-month sentence for two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.

the history of January 6 takes an especially brazen turn \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:23 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Shortly after the  January 6, 2021, attack  on the US Capitol, the political right spent a lot of time parsing whether the word “insurrection” was an apt description of the day’s events.\n \n\n   \n  Today, President Donald Trump’s Justice Department is apparently  sanctioning its own prosecutors  for calling January 6 a mere “mob of rioters.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s difficult to fully convey just how brazen Trump’s efforts to rewrite the history of the day have become. He’s spent years trying to turn people who launched the worst attack on the US Capitol in two centuries into sympathetic figures. He even pardoned a bunch of people who assaulted police that day, despite  more than 8 in 10 Americans opposing that .\n \n\n   \n  But sometimes something comes along that completely drives the whole thing home.\n \n\n   \n  That’s what happened this week, in the  case of Taylor Taranto .\n \n\n   \n  To recap: Taranto was among those pardoned by Trump for his actions on January 6. But before that pardon, he committed an unrelated crime. In 2023, he was arrested in former President Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, neighborhood with numerous firearms and materials to make explosives. He was convicted in May.\n \n\n   \n  By late Tuesday, a reporter at Politico noted something interesting: Prosecutors in their sentencing memo for Taranto noted his presence in the “mob of rioters” on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building,” the  sentencing memo  said. “After the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  This wouldn’t normally be surprising, mind you. It’s a factual statement that notes the defendant isn’t a newcomer to legal trouble.\n \n\n   \n  But it  was  notable next to Trump’s own rhetoric about January 6 – and given the Trump DOJ’s efforts to  force out a batch of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases.\n \n\n   \n  Sure enough, mere hours later the prosecutors on the case – Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White – were  placed on leave . Then their sentencing memo was pulled from the docket and replaced with a new one, signed by different prosecutors, that excised the paragraph on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  And just in case it wasn’t clear that the changes were made to benefit Trump, consider another change to the sentencing memo.\n \n\n   \n  The other interesting aspect of Taranto’s crime is Trump’s proximity to it. In fact, Taranto was apprehended near Obama’s home  shortly after Trump reshared a post that included an alleged address for the former president  to social media. Prosecutors said Taranto began livestreaming in the area shortly after promoting Trump’s post.\n \n\n   \n  The new sentencing memo also removed a reference to that fact.\n \n\n   \n  The US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, declined to shed light on why the prosecutors were put on leave.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the papers speak for themselves, and what goes on in this office is not something that I’m going to comment on. Thank you,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n  We still have plenty to learn about what happened here. But it’s one of the most glaring examples of the fruits of Trump’s long-running campaign to retcon January 6 – and to turn it into anything other than a tragic day for our country and our democracy.\n \n\n   \n  After the dust settled on that day, Trump and some allies in Congress began suggestively questioning how violent the day was, with one GOP congressman infamously comparing it to a “ normal tourist visit .”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump launched his 2024 campaign, he began featuring a  music video from a choir of January 6 defendants  that effectively lionized them. He began talking about the defendants as if they were ill-treated political “hostages,” often  citing misinformation  in the process.\n \n\n   \n  Then he, on his first day back in office, pardoned nearly all of them – even the worst offenders.\n \n\n   \n  But that was merely the first step.\n \n\n   \n  We’ve also seen a  purge of dozens of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases, despite them merely enforcing the law. Trump’s Justice Department agreed to  settle a wrongful death suit for $5 million with the family of Ashli Babbitt , who was killed after breaking into a sensitive area of the Capitol, cementing her status as a martyr for some portions of the extreme right. The administration has also  pressured the Smithsonian , which has in some cases  softened its language about the events that day . The president and allies have continued to overhype  relatively minor   disclosures  about the government’s actions vis-a-vis January 6, which took place while Trump was in office, as if they proved a massive conspiracy against Trump and the GOP. The House is now undertaking an investigation that  appears aimed at recasting the narrative  of that day.\n \n\n   \n  Oh, and we recently learned Trump is reportedly  seeking $230 million  from his own government for alleged damages from the January 6 probe and other federal investigations. (Trump was never tried in these cases, which were dropped after he was reelected president, but nor was he acquitted.)\n \n\n   \n  If anything epitomizes Trump’s attempts to turn those who fueled what happened on January 6 into victims, it’s surely that. Even if you don’t think Trump committed a crime, the people who attacked the Capitol were clearly spurred by his lies about voter fraud and the supposedly stolen election.\n \n\n   \n  Trump just keeps pushing the envelope here, and we keep seeing that manifest itself in actions by his Justice Department and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  The question from there is whether he’s able to actually rewrite history in Americans’ minds.\n \n\n   \n  To this point, that’s been  a tough slog . Trump’s pardons of violent January 6 defendants were overwhelmingly unpopular. Strong majorities of Americans still regard that day as an attack against democracy.\n \n\n   \n  But we’ve also seen a steady downgrading of the right’s views on that day.\n \n\n   \n  By mid-2021, a Monmouth University poll showed 62% of Republicans labeled that day a “riot,” and 33% called it an “insurrection.” Two years later, though, those numbers  dropped significantly – to 44% and 15%, respectively .\n \n\n   \n  In that way, the erasure of the “mob of rioters” from the memo reflects how the political right has come to view that day.\n \n\n   \n  But that doesn’t mean it’s a reflection of the truth.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/tech/apple-earnings-q4-iphone-17-sales","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:13:00-04:00","title":"Apple Provides Early Glimpse Into iPhone 17 Sales Performance in Fourth-Quarter Earnings","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Apple reported strong fourth-quarter earnings, with iPhone sales reaching $49 billion—up from $46.2 billion the previous year—despite slightly missing Wall Street expectations.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that provided an early glimpse into how the iPhone 17 lineup may be catching on so far.   \n \n\n   \n  Apple’s earnings for the quarter that ended in September met analysts’ expectations on revenue but slightly missed on iPhone sales.   iPhone sales in the fourth quarter were $49 billion, up from $46.2 billion compared to the same period a   year ago but slightly lower than the $50.1 billion Wall Street was expecting. Overall revenue was $102.5 billion, an increase from $94.9 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Apple says both revenue and iPhone sales   numbers represent a record for the fourth   quarter. Services revenue, another closely watched metric ,  also hit an   all-time record at $28.8 billion, an increase from roughly $25 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  During Apple’s earnings call on Thursday,   CEO Tim Cook said the company expects the December quarter’s revenue “to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for the iPhone,” suggesting strong iPhone 17 sales.\n \n\n   \n  Apple shares were up around 3% in after-hours trading.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street is looking for assurance that Apple’s biggest revenue driver is still growing despite concerns that the company is behind in the AI race. Analysts had estimated strong demand for the iPhone 17 lineup, which Apple launched in late September.\n \n\n   \n  However, overall sales in China   shrunk compared to a year ago, with the company generating $14.5 billion in revenue in the region. In 2024, Apple earned $15 billion during the same period. Cook said on Thursday that he expects iPhone revenue to return to growth in China in the current quarter based on how the iPhone 17 is being received.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s results paint an early picture of iPhone sales since its fourth quarter ended on September 27, eight days after the iPhone 17 launch. Still, it’s possible that sales slowed in the July and August months as consumers waited for the iPhone 17.\n \n\n   \n  The iPhone 17 series outsold its predecessor by 14% in its first 10 days in the United States and China, according to  Counterpoint Research , with the base iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Max being the most in demand. The iPhone Air, touted as the thinnest iPhone ever, is seeing “muted customer interest” according to UBS, which has been tracking retail wait times for new iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  Apple’s iPhone business is always under a microscope as the company’s largest revenue driver. But the tech industry is particularly paying close attention, prompted by speculation that another AI-powered gadget may eventually supplant the smartphone.\n \n\n   \n  While analysts previously grilled Apple about its AI strategy on recent earnings calls, Wall Street was more interested in the factors driving iPhone demand and the impact of tariffs. Apple said it expects to incur $1.4 billion in tariff-related costs this quarter.\n \n\n   \n  But Cook said he sees “opportunities on the App Store” for AI when asked about whether the rise of chatbots and AI apps will change how consumers use apps. He also said Apple Intelligence — a suite of AI-powered features for the iPhone and the company’s other products — is motivating people to upgrade their iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  “I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we’re very bullish on it becoming a greater factor, and that’s the way that we look at it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Apple delayed an update to Siri earlier this year that would have brought it closer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Rivals like Google, Microsoft and Samsung,   meanwhile, continue to pour billions into their AI infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  The earnings come in what has been a challenging year for Apple.\n \n\n   \n  The company has been impacted by   President Donald Trump’s trade war and has faced pressure from the Trump administration to make its iPhones domestically. Earlier this year it committed to investing $600 billion toward expanding its US operations. But Thursday’s earnings, along with the company surpassing a $4 trillion market capitalization earlier this week, represent a turnaround.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/thanksgiving-travel-shutdown-vance-duffy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:49:00-04:00","title":"Vance and Duffy warn Thanksgiving travel ‘could be a disaster’ if shutdown barrels on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown enters its final weeks, Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have issued urgent warnings that Thanksgiving travel could become a 'disaster' due to the lack of government funding.

Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches next month without an end in sight to the  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  Their comments came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, during which they aired their concerns with the current state of the industry and worked out potential, temporary solutions to ease the strain on  Federal Aviation Administration employees  who are being forced to work without pay to ensure Americans can fly safely, two White House officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving. We want people to be able to travel for business,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy chimed in adding, “Our traffic will be snarled, but it will be a disaster in aviation.”\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines CEO Robert Isom, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels, Teamsters President Sean O’Brien and American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley were among those who attended Thursday’s roundtable, the officials said, in addition to nine other industry leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Behind closed doors, Vance and Duffy listened as O’Brien and Kelley laid out their concerns about the stress on their workforce, the officials told CNN. Meanwhile Isom and Kirby, in addition to a series of other airline association leaders, made clear just how damaging the shutdown was not only to their industry, but also the larger economy.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy told the group that he was working on recruiting more air traffic controllers as a temporary solution, arguing that they are most affected, they said.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting came as air traffic controllers missed their first full paycheck of the shutdown this week. Controllers, employed by the FAA, are among the government employees required to continue working without pay.\n \n\n   \n  During the first Trump administration, controller staffing shortages helped   tip the scales  to end the longest government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, the decision by 10 air traffic controllers to call out sick temporarily shut down travel at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and caused delays at other major hubs in New Jersey, Philadelphia and Atlanta, driving President Donald Trump to agree to a temporary government funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis found that reports of staffing problems at FAA facilities have more than quadrupled compared to the same period a year ago, raising broad concern over the fast-approaching Thanksgiving holiday.\n \n\n   \n  Geoff Freeman, the CEO of the US Travel Association who also attended the meeting, told CNN in a statement: “Sixty percent of Americans are already reconsidering their travel plans during the shutdown. It is costing the travel industry $1 billion a week in economic damage and that is before we get to the most important travel week of the year.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the issues that were raised on Thursday, Vance maintained the administration’s position that the only way out of this was for Democrats to pass a clean spending bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Freeman, as well as O’Brien and Kirby, have all now joined Republicans in calling for Congress to pass the short-term funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  “Congress should pass a clean continuing resolution now,” Freeman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Vance reiterated that point when addressing reporters after the meeting, acknowledging that the key issue Democrats have fought with the GOP over — healthcare subsidies expiring — are valid, but that those negotiations would not happen “at the barrel of a gun.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrats response to that is, give us everything we want, or we’re going to shut down the government and keep it shut down. That is not reasonable behavior,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance added that Republicans “can’t reward” Democrats for using the shutdown as a negotiating tool, because if it works, they will continue to use it — a point the officials said he also made during the roundtable.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how a child behaves. That is not how a responsible governing party behaves in the United States of America,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN Thursday they have no intention or need to meet with Democrats until the government is reopened.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll see if things change,” the official said. “Nothing to meet about right now though.”\n \n\n   \n  The full list of attendees at the White House roundtable on Thursday:\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-guard-quick-reaction-force","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:53:00Z","title":"Trump’s National Guard quick reaction force largely already exists, officials say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s executive order in August 2025 calling for a National Guard quick reaction force for domestic use has been largely met by existing forces, according to Pentagon officials.

\nUpdated: \n        4:53 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon is moving forward on orders from President Donald Trump to build a National Guard quick reaction force in each state for domestic use, though two US officials say the effort is largely making incremental changes to a mission the Guard already undertakes.\n \n\n   \n  Trump ordered that the Pentagon “ensure the availability of a standing National Guard quick reaction force that shall be resourced, trained, and available for rapid nationwide deployment,” in an August  executive order .\n \n\n   \n  But the two officials said those reaction forces already exist.\n \n\n   \n  “This whole thing – we’re already doing it,” one of the US officials said. “This is just updated guidance.”\n \n\n   \n  The officials said that plans are being developed within the Defense Department and National Guard for possible additional training or increase to the number of personnel available for existing units to meet the new requirement.\n \n\n   \n  Internal Pentagon guidance directs that most states have roughly 500 individuals dedicated to the reaction force, one of the officials said, though that number could vary depending on the size of the state.\n \n\n   \n  Some states may have to increase the size of their Guard contingent dedicated to the mission to meet that guidance.\n \n\n   \n  The Guardian was first to report on the guidance, which was issued earlier this month, with the director of operations for the Pentagon’s National Guard bureau outlining troop numbers for the quick reaction forces ordered by Trump including a total of roughly 23,500 troops nationally.\n \n\n   \n  The Guard already has two types of forces that meet this mission – the National Guard Reaction Force and the Homeland Response Force.\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard Reaction Force in each state provides “a rapid response capability focused on incidents requiring defense support of civilian authorities,” a publicly available fact sheet says.\n \n\n   \n  When needed, that force is meant to be able to deploy 25% of its personnel within the first eight hours, 50% of its personnel within 12 hours, and the entire contingent within 24 hours. Their mission, according to the fact sheet, includes civil disturbance control and personnel and site security.\n \n\n   \n  The Homeland Response Force, meanwhile, is meant to be able to assemble within six hours and support emergency response chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive disasters. Within that force, the US official said, is a group of roughly 200 US soldiers whose job is riot and crowd control.\n \n\n   \n  Those forces are organized matching the 10 regions the Federal Emergency Management Agency uses to subdivide US land, the US official said, meaning they are responsible for responding first for a group of states and/or territories. Region 2, for example, includes New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon guidance comes as the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to use the Guard in various states as support to law enforcement and immigration officials. The administration has been caught up in legal disputes over its deployment of the Guard in  Los Angeles ,  Portland , and  Chicago , and CNN reported Wednesday that orders for the National Guard in Washington, DC, have been  extended into 2026 .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/media/mtg-the-view-marjorie-taylor-greene-abc-disney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:09:00Z","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene to Appear on 'The View' Amid Pivot from Republican Leadership","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican congresswoman from Georgia known for her confrontational rhetoric and political defiance, is set to appear on 'The View' next Tuesday, marking a significant shift in media relations.

pass of the sun. Discover where it’s going next \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An interstellar comet that originated outside our solar system just made its closest pass of the sun, setting it on an outgoing path — but it’s not leaving our cosmic neighborhood yet.\n \n\n   \n  The comet, dubbed 3I/ATLAS, came within about   126 million miles (203 million kilometers) of our star, according to  EarthSky . The object is currently behind the sun from the perspective of ground-based telescopes on Earth, but astronomers anticipate being able to view the comet again in a few weeks, said Darryl Seligman, assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University.\n \n\n   \n  Stargazers using telescopes should be able to see the object in the predawn sky beginning November 11, according to EarthSky.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers will have a few more months to observe the comet before it begins heading   out of our solar system, Seligman said.\n \n\n   \n  The comet will make its closest approach of Earth on December 19, coming within about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) — but it poses no threat to our planet, according to the  European Space Agency .\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers have been observing the comet, only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, since its discovery on July 1.\n \n\n   \n  Each observation is shedding light on this interstellar object and how different it may be from comets that originated in our solar system.\n \n\n   \n    The ingredients of an interstellar comet\n \n\n   \n  Comets are like dirty snowballs left over from the formation of solar systems.\n \n\n   \n  A comet’s nucleus is its solid core, made of ice, dust and rocks. When comets travel near stars such as the sun, heat causes them to release gas and dust, which creates their signature tails.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers are interested in capturing as many observations of the comet as they can because as it nears the sun, material releasing from the object could reveal more about its composition — and the star system where it originated.\n \n\n   \n  “When it gets closest to the sun, you get the most holistic view of the nucleus possible,” Seligman said. “One of the main things driving most cometary scientists is, what is the composition of the volatiles? It shows you the initial primordial material that it formed from.”\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have used powerful tools, such as the Hubble Space and James Webb Space telescopes, along with a multitude of space-based missions, such as  SPHEREx , to study the comet.\n \n\n   \n  The SPHEREx and Webb observations detected carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide,  carbonyl sulphide  and water ice releasing from the comet as it neared the sun, according to the ESA.\n \n\n   \n  Preliminary estimates indicate that the interstellar comet is 3 billion   to 11 billion years old, according to a  study  coauthored by Seligman and Aster Taylor, a doctoral student and Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Fellow at the University of Michigan, in August.

administration pulls Pentagon lawyers \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Ellis Kim, Morgan Rimmer, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:39 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democrats say the Trump administration still won’t share critical details of  recent US military strikes  on suspected drug boats in the western hemisphere, asserting that Pentagon lawyers were pulled at the last minute Thursday from a briefing on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  As they emerged from the closed-door session, they railed on the administration for not being transparent and appearing to flout the law. The briefing came a day after  Democrats say they were shut out of another meeting  where administration officials shared information on the strikes with their Republican colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  “Am I leaving satisfied? Absolutely not. And the last word that I gave to the admiral was, ‘I hope you recognize the constitutional peril that you are in and the peril you are putting our troops in’,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts told reporters of the Thursday briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “What I heard here today was a tactical brief. I heard no strategy, no end game, no assessment of how they are going to end the flow of drugs into the United States, which needs to happen, by the way,” Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, who sits on the House Armed Services and the Intelligence committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Fuming at a separate press conference over his accusation that the White House  cut Democrats out  of a Wednesday briefing, Sen. Mark Warner had an even sharper take: “bullsh*t.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be blunt, what the administration did in the last 24 hours is corrosive, not only to our democracy, but downright dangerous for our national security,” Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration in recent weeks has accelerated its attacks against boats they allege are involved in drug trafficking. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have repeatedly criticized the administration for failing to provide them with enough information related to those strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has defended its information sharing with Congress, telling CNN earlier this week it has given  seven separate classified briefings  on the strikes to various committees. But the information that Pentagon officials have offered so far on those attacks during closed-door briefings has largely fueled more questions and concerns from Democrats about the administration’s legal justification for them – especially as only select Republicans have been allowed to see the classified legal opinion detailing that argument.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats said the information provided to them Thursday fell short of what they needed to provide proper congressional checks on the president’s war powers.\n \n\n   \n  “I sit on the Armed Services and the Intelligence Committee. Our job is to oversee the use of lethal force by our military outside of the United States, and I’m walking away without an understanding of how and why they’re making an assessment that the use of lethal force is adequate here,” Crow said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California similarly said “the level of transparency was not OK” and added that “there’s nothing that we heard in there that changes my assessment that this is completely illegal, that it is unlawful and even if Congress authorized it, it would still be illegal because there are extrajudicial killings where we have no evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  The briefers, Jacobs said, only cited Article II as the legal justification for the strikes and said they didn’t know the identities of all of the individuals involved in them. They also told lawmakers that cocaine was the only narcotic targeted in the strikes so far and claimed it is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl,” according to the congresswoman. “It was not a satisfactory answer for most of us,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the Democratic ranking members, Republican chairmen of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees attended the meeting but declined to comment to reporters afterward.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Mike Rogers, the Armed Services chairman, would only tell CNN he expects an additional briefing.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans defend need for bipartisan briefings\n \n\n   \n  Still, several Senate Republicans said Democrats should have been invited to Wednesday’s briefing on the Caribbean boat strikes, though they insisted their exclusion wasn’t malicious.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an unfortunate situation, and I wish it wouldn’t have happened this way. It did, but I’ve talked to a number of my colleagues already and told them that we still agree that this should be delivered on a bipartisan basis,” Sen. Mike Rounds, who sits on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Rounds added that his understanding was that several GOP senators had requested a further briefing on the legality of the strikes, and other Republicans, including him, also asked to be included.\n \n\n   \n  “When I got into the meeting, I realized that there were people from a lot of different committees, but I couldn’t identify the group in particular, but there were no Democrats there,” he said. “And so afterwards, we went back and followed up. The White House called us and said, ‘Yeah, this was a separate meeting. It was asked for by one of your colleagues.’ We just happen to have also been invited to it, and that is consistent with what we saw.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Kevin Cramer agreed that his Democratic colleagues should have access to the same briefings as Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that any administration should leave out any party from a briefing of that level of importance. And I think their justification — you can argue it, and no doubt people will — but I don’t think that something of that importance shouldn’t be shared. Whether it’s legal justification or if there’s — if there are details about who are on these boats and what these boats are containing, you know, the tactics, I think all of that should be available to people who oversee the Pentagon,” Cramer said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats didn’t hide their their frustration with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “It is totally unprecedented in my 15 years of service in the United States Senate that intelligence briefings on a matter of this consequence would be held for one party alone,” said an angry Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes to this administration concealing the facts and worrying about the law.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/credit-scores-medical-debt-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:49:00Z","title":"Trump Team Takes Aim at State Laws Shielding Consumers’ Credit Scores from Medical Debt","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, issued new guidance on October 30, 2025, arguing that federal law under the Fair Credit Reporting Act grants only the federal government authority to regulate medical debt on credit reports.

Levey, KFF Health News\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:49 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration took another step Tuesday to weaken protections for Americans with medical debt, issuing new guidance that threatens ongoing state efforts to keep that debt off consumers’ credit reports.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen states, including Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Maryland, New York, and most of New England, have enacted laws in recent years to keep medical debt from affecting consumers’ credit.\n \n\n   \n  And more states — including several in conservative regions of the Midwest and Mountain West —  have been considering  similar protections, spurred by bipartisan concerns that medical debt on a credit report can make it harder for people to get a home, a car, or a job.\n \n\n   \n  Nationwide,  about 100 million people  have some form of health care debt, with millions burdened by $10,000 or more in unpaid bills.\n \n\n   \n  But  in the new guidance , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau asserts that federal law bars states from restricting medical debts from credit reports, arguing that only the federal government has this authority.\n \n\n   \n  “Congress meant to occupy the field of consumer reporting and displace state laws,” the bureau concluded in an “interpretive rule” signed by Russell Vought, the White House budget director and acting head of the CFPB.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance, which offers a new interpretation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, reverses policies advanced under former President Joe Biden that sought to empower states to expand protections for people with medical debt.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s latest move will not immediately roll back existing state protections.\n \n\n   \n  But advocates for patients and consumers warn that the new guidance may stall progress elsewhere, just as millions of Americans are poised to lose federal aid that helps them buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The aid is tied up in the current budget showdown between congressional Republicans and Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “You’d be hard-pressed to find a crueler regulatory interpretation,” said Elisabeth Benjamin, a vice president for the Community Service Society of New York. The nonprofit has pushed for medical debt protections in that state.\n \n\n   \n  Lucy Culp, who oversees state lobbying efforts by Blood Cancer United, formerly known as the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, warned that the Trump administration’s guidance could reverberate across the country. “This rule will have a chilling effect on states’ willingness to pass these critical patient protections,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The new CFPB guidance might spur more litigation challenging state restrictions on medical debt credit reporting.\n \n\n   \n  Trade groups representing credit reporting agencies and debt collectors went to court early this year challenging  regulations issued by the Biden administration  that would have removed medical debt from credit reports nationwide. They argued that the administration exceeded its authority in issuing the credit reporting restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  The federal restrictions would have helped an estimated 15 million people.

former prosecutors alarmed after DOJ scrubs mentions of Trump and January 6 from court records \n       \n  By Katelyn  Polantz, Holmes Lybrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:15 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department’s decision to sideline two US attorneys and remove mentions of Donald Trump and the US Capitol attack from court papers before the sentencing of a pardoned January 6 rioter is being viewed by former and current career prosecutors as an alarming whitewashing of history.\n \n\n   \n  The events around the case of Taylor Taranto, who was convicted of bringing illegal guns near Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, residence after talking online about violence toward the federal government, has shocked the network of Justice Department employees and alumni, several sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested in June 2023 after claiming on an internet livestream that he had a detonator the day before, law enforcement officials  told CNN at the time,  and was searching for underground tunnels that led inside Obama and others’ homes.\n \n\n   \n  He had also been present at the Capitol riot and charged with related crimes, though he was never convicted because Trump pardoned him before a trial. He has already spent 23 months behind bars and hasn’t been detained since he was pardoned.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Carl Nichols, a 2019 Trump appointee, had found him guilty at trial in May of the gun crimes and for making a false threat to use a car bomb against a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  In a  sentencing memo for Taranto filed Tuesday , prosecutors Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White wrote that after “then-former President Donald Trump published on a social media platform the purported address of former President Barack Obama,” Taranto had re-posted Trump “and thereafter started livestreaming from his van” as he drove through Obama’s neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s original post – which included the Obama address – was itself a repost of a blog article.\n \n\n   \n  Politico reporter Kyle Cheney highlighted the filing and mentioned it also included Taranto taking part in the January 6 riot, on the social media platform X late Tuesday night. Within 24 hours, the court filing was no longer available in the court record and the two prosecutors who had signed it were suspended from their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  In the original memo, Valdivia and White wrote that “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building” and “after the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  Two new prosecutors then  filed an amended version  of the sentencing memo to the court on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  That new memo scrubbed all references to Trump and him posting Obama’s supposed address – which Taranto had reposted – as well as Taranto’s participation and conviction related to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s shocking that prosecutors could be put on leave for accurately stating the court record in a sentencing memo, and it’s just as shocking that those truthful statements have been whitewashed in a revised filing,” said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department attorney and now executive director and founder of Justice Connection, which works to represent the viewpoints of former federal prosecutors, especially those who have been fired by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “These prosecutors did their job and upheld their duty of candor by informing the court of clearly established facts relevant to their case,” Young added.\n \n\n   \n  Jeanine Pirro, the US Attorney in Washington, DC, did not comment on the suspensions and filing changes when asked about it during a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the papers speak for themselves, and what goes on in this office is not something that I’m going to comment on. Thank you,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Orwellian’\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the moves made by the Justice Department had employees reeling within the US Attorney’s Office in DC and the FBI, which had investigated and caught Taranto, believing he was a danger to the public in 2023, people familiar with the office told CNN on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One source called the sentencing memo change “Orwellian.”\n \n\n   \n  Valdivia had no indication he may have employment issues — especially given that on Tuesday, the day before his suspension, he helped to secure a guilty verdict from a jury in a fraud case where he was on the trial team, according to two people familiar with the US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, White is a supervisor on Superior Court cases and was a US Marine.\n \n\n   \n  A Justice Department spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday following the suspensions: “While we don’t comment on personnel decisions, we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously. We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson declined to clarify if the comments were about Taranto’s 2023 actions toward Obama, or his participation in the Capitol riot in 2021, in which a mob of Trump supporters injured multiple people, including many police protecting the federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The move by Justice Department officials to place the two attorneys on leave and erase all mention of Trump posting Obama’s address or Taranto’s participation in the events of January 6 comes at a time when administration officials have already worked to fire scores of federal prosecutors and officers they see as potential roadblocks in their efforts to use the DOJ against political opponents.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia were recently pushed out of the Justice Department after failing to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and many prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases were removed from the DC US Attorney’s office earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n    Taranto sentenced to 21 months\n \n\n   \n  When Taranto was initially investigated, one source said, he had been on federal law enforcement radar because he had been at the January 6 riot. But federal authorities focused on him after he livestreamed a video in 2023 where he threatened bombing federal facilities, and law enforcement then arrested him near Obama’s Washington address.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by Nichols of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ continued to seek the 27-month sentence originally sought by White and Valdivia, who said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto’s attorney asked the court to sentence him to time served in jail already, with no further detention. The defense attorney, Carmen Hernandez, has asked for rehabilitation that the court could order, noting Taranto’s past military service and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, according to a filing on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Typically, a defendant’s history and characteristics become part of court arguments for or against leniency when a judge decides a sentence.\n \n\n   \n  At a hearing Thursday, Nichols sentenced Taranto to 21 months in prison, essentially covered by time served.\n \n\n   \n  Nichols found that Taranto “made troubling statements” in his online livestream but noted he had no criminal history and his conduct “was far from egregious.”\n \n\n   \n  Taranto spoke briefly during Thursday’s hearing, not to apologize for his conduct but to highlight a book on the 1787 constitutional convention and mention that some people questioned the results of the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to keep people’s minds open,” he concluded.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also said he thought the two prosecutors placed on leave “upheld the highest standard” throughout the case.\n \n\n   \n  “My view is that they did a commendable and exceptional job,” Nichols said of the prosecutors, adding that he felt “they did a truly excellent job in this case.”\n \n\n   \n  White and Valdivia attended Taranto’s sentencing and declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz and Casey Gannon contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/style/royal-lodge-prince-andrew-gbr-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00Z","title":"Everything we know about Royal Lodge, Prince Andrew’s 30-room mansion in Windsor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III has ordered Prince Andrew to be stripped of his 'Prince' title and evicted from Royal Lodge, a 30-room royal residence in Windsor Great Park where he has lived since 2003.

Lianne Kolirin and Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:07 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s King Charles has announced that his brother,  Andrew , will be stripped of his “ prince ” title and ordered to leave Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion that has been his home since 2003, over the swirling Jeffrey Epstein scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the sprawling property in Windsor Great Park, west of London, that is home to Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and where their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, spent much of their teenage years\n \n\n   \n    Why does Andrew live in Royal Lodge?\n \n\n   \n  The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, which is officially owned by the Crown Estate. The prince paid £1 million for the property in 2003, and under the terms of the 75-year lease, which was due to expire on June 15, 2078, he was expected to pay for any refurbishment work and the maintenance of the surrounding grounds.\n \n\n   \n  He was also required upfront to pay £7.5 million ($10 million) to cover necessary refurbishments that were completed in 2005, according to a  National Audit Office report.  According to the lease, signed on August 8, 2003, rent “if demanded” was only required to be “one peppercorn” per annum.\n \n\n   \n  The property sits in an estate of 40 hectares (99 acres) and features a swimming pool, an aviary, six lodge cottages, a gardener’s cottage and accommodation for police protecting the royals to stay in.\n \n\n   \n  It is situated within Windsor Great Park, close to Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage (where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously lived) and Forest Lodge, the Windsor residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n \n\n   \n  There had been intense media speculation in recent weeks over Prince Andrew’s continued occupancy of Royal Lodge. Before Thursday’s announcement, Buckingham Palace and the Crown Estate had declined to comment on reports that he was in talks to leave the residence.\n \n\n   \n    Two centuries of royal residents\n \n\n   \n  A house has stood on the site since at least the 1660s, although it has undergone considerable updates and renovations since then. Its first links with the royal family came in the early 19th century when George IV, then the prince regent, converted the rustic-styled cottage into a hunting lodge and then private retreat. By the mid-1820s it had become known as Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  After George died in 1830, much of the structure was pulled down by William IV and it was used as a “grace and favor” residence for most of the rest of the century.\n \n\n   \n  The Royal Chapel was added to the site in 1865, but, though situated within the grounds of the lodge, it does not come under the current lease.\n \n\n   \n  The property was rebuilt during the 1930s around a room remaining from George IV’s original cottage.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, lived in the lodge as a child, moving there with her parents — then the Duke and Duchess of York — in 1932. The family remained at Royal Lodge until the duke and duchess were crowned four years later, following the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n  Following her husband’s death in 1952 and the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother used the Royal Lodge as her Windsor residence until her death in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  After his grandmother died, Prince Andrew approached the Crown Estate about acquiring the leasehold on the property. The property was not offered to the wider market because of its sensitive location in the heart of Windsor Great Park and the need for security, given its proximity to the Royal Chapel.\n \n\n   \n    What changes has Andrew made?\n \n\n   \n  The renovation work that Andrew carried out on the family property included internal alterations to the tiled ceiling, external repainting, new tarmac for the gate entrance and light fittings and cameras for outside the lodge, according to a planning application lodged with the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier planning applications show that the local authorities granted permission to build a single-story property to accommodate police officers protecting the site in 1990, and permission was given for the construction of a conservatory in 2001.\n \n\n   \n    Queen Elizabeth’s fairy-tale playhouse\n \n\n   \n  Also in the grounds is Y Bwthyn Bach, which translates from Welsh as “little cottage.” The miniature thatched cottage was given by the people of Wales to the late Queen Elizabeth II on her sixth birthday and was where she and her sister, Princess Margaret, played as children — as did their children and grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n  In a 2012 BBC documentary called “The Diamond Queen,” Princess Beatrice said she and her sister had been “lucky enough” to play there together with their cousins as children.\n \n\n   \n  She described it as the “most glamorous Wendy house ever” and said that she spent about a year overseeing its renovation. This, she said, involved new wiring, new curtains and completely rethatching the cottage to give it a “bit of a spruce-up.”   \n \n\n   \n  Viewers got to see the princess take host Andrew Marr inside the miniature property, which was fully furnished and complete with furniture, crockery and glassware and a fridge from the 1930s.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Prince Andrew and his former wife hosted the wedding celebrations for their younger daughter, Eugenie, and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, at the lodge following the official ceremony at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.   \n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Eugenie’s sister, Beatrice, tied the knot on the estate itself, marrying Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a small ceremony in the chapel while Covid-19 restrictions were in place.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/basketball-nba-nikola-topic-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00Z","title":"Oklahoma City Thunder Guard Nikola Topic Diagnosed with Testicular Cancer and Undergoing Chemotherapy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Oklahoma City Thunder guard Nikola Topic has been diagnosed with testicular cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy.

of justice: Ed Martin’s influence at DOJ \n       \n  By Katelyn  Polantz, Evan Perez, Hannah Rabinowitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Failing to win Senate approval as US Attorney for Washington, DC, has made Ed Martin a more formidable force inside the Trump Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  After three chaotic months as interim US attorney earlier this year, Justice Department officials placed Martin in the department’s headquarters in a traditionally more supervised position. Unconfirmable and intent on rewriting the consequences of the January 6 prosecutions, Martin was, as one Trump ally said, being put under more “adult supervision.”\n \n\n   \n  That move, though, didn’t appear to hold him back. Martin now wields a surprising amount of political power and four titles: Associate Deputy Attorney General, Pardon Attorney, director of the Weaponization Working Group and Special Attorney for Mortgage Fraud. He’s also become the chief enforcer of using the Justice Department to exact President Donald Trump’s personal agenda — including by playing a role behind the scenes in the recent indictments of Trump foes  James Comey  and  Letitia James,  delving into so-called “weaponization” within the federal government and Biden-era pardons, and continuing to bear down on others Trump wants to see investigated.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Martin told the Republican-led House Oversight Committee that he was working on an “ongoing investigation” of pardons and commutations during Joe Biden’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, which adds fuel to Trump’s attacks of presidential clemency given to members of the House Select Committee that investigated January 6 and others before they faced charges, recasts the traditional role of a pardon attorney in the extreme. Previously the job focused on reviewing and making recommendations to the president after prisoners petitioned for clemency. Under Martin, it’s become a much more active, politicized approach, where he is now critiquing past presidents’ clemency, a Constitutional power that has few limitations.\n \n\n   \n  “My ongoing investigation has revealed abuses of the pardon and commutation process by political actors in the Biden Administration. The use of AutoPen at the direction of staff and perhaps others is troubling,” Martin wrote to committee chairman James Comer, according to an email to obtained by CNN’s Jake Tapper. The Justice Department has previously said a president’s use of an autopen is legally sound.\n \n\n   \n  Martin’s influence also has become evident in cases where career prosecutors have balked at charging Trump political opponents and which his bosses, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, had reservations about before bringing.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, prosecutions of Comey and  James  have moved ahead over the protests of career prosecutors and even some Trump political appointees. Firings and resignations by experienced prosecutors have followed, and Martin has been in close contact with  Lindsey Halligan , whom Trump placed as the lead US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, who initiated those indictments, sources tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, Martin has turned his focus toward building his connections to other US Attorneys’ Offices, including in Atlanta, St. Louis and upstate New York, according to sources familiar with Martin’s efforts. Some of that effort may include known probes around Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor whom Trump has tried to fire, on mortgage fraud allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “Ed Martin is one of the most dangerous people in the Justice Department. He’s not a serious lawyer, but he has serious power,” said Liz Oyer, a former career Justice Department official who preceded Martin as pardon attorney. “He seemingly has the power to open criminal investigations, which is serious business. Being subject to a criminal investigation can ruin someone’s life.”\n \n\n   \n  Oyer noted that investigating Trump’s political opponents and holding the pardon post gives Martin especially unusual influence — as a political force who can both punish Trump’s enemies and reward his friends.\n \n\n   \n  His willingness to use the Justice Department to advance MAGA movement politics stands in contrast with the Justice Department norms since the Richard Nixon era. Reforms after the Watergate crisis led to a tradition under Republican and Democratic administrations to distance prosecution decisions from the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Even in the first Trump administration, attorneys general generally enforced rules limiting contact between White House officials and Justice Department employees.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has no such qualms and is known to maintain regular contact with White House officials, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  A Missouri Republican, Martin burnished his MAGA credentials following the 2021 Capital attack, becoming a vocal defender of Trump vote fraud claims in the 2020 election and of January 6 rioters — some of whom he represented as an attorney.\n \n\n   \n  As part of his so-called weaponization probe, Martin brought onto his staff former FBI agent Jared Wise, who was prosecuted for allegedly urging January 6 rioters to attack law enforcement officers, calling the officers “Nazis” and the “Gestapo.”\n \n\n   \n  Martin maintains at least two offices at the Justice Department – one in a complex north of the US Capitol where the pardon attorney office is located, the other inside the Justice Department headquarters.\n \n\n   \n  His active social media presence including a Substack blog and his support for January 6 rioters caused wary Senate Republicans to tank his nomination to lead the federal prosecutors’ office in Washington, DC, which prosecuted more than 1,000 January 6 riot defendants, in May.\n \n\n   \n  But Martin appears undaunted despite receiving cautions from top Justice officials about some of his public comments.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Martin has been posting nearly every day on social media photos of people he meets with, including right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the comedian Russel Brand, US Attorneys from outside of DC, and Trump supporters in politics from around the country.\n \n\n   \n  He also has been lobbying prosecutors in Maryland to pursue mortgage fraud allegations around Democratic California Sen.  Adam Schiff,  another one of Trump’s political opponents, who helped lead congressional investigations of him, sources say.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department and Martin didn’t comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Martin sought to flex his influence earlier this month as former New York Rep. George Santos won a sentence commutation from the president, after serving in a minimal-security federal prison camp only three months of his seven-year sentence for fraud.\n \n\n   \n  Santos for months had sought the help of intermediaries to get Trump’s attention for a pardon and Martin tried to help behind the scenes, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  After the president granted the commutation, Martin said in a post on X: “I was honored as U.S. Pardon Attorney to have played a small role” in the clemency grant, and he thanks the president for “making clemency great again.”\n \n\n   \n  “Martin has made it known that his intent with pardons is to use them to benefit people with MAGA affiliations,” Oyer said. “For Martin to have both of those roles,” of pardon attorney and prosecutor, “it shows how this department is operating a system of both punishment and reward.”\n \n\n   \n    Catching Trump’s attention\n \n\n   \n  Some of Martin’s recent campaigns have been channeled into the president’s own social media feed. For instance, with Martin as the mortgage fraud investigator, Trump lashed out at Bondi, demanding in a  remarkable Truth Social  post for the prosecution of his political enemies.\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump wrote. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Blanche has sought to bring a measure of control to Martin’s efforts, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The tension between Blanche and Martin spilled out into the public in late September, after Martin sent a letter to an FBI agent who had responded to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. Martin, in his letter, disclosed what he said was an investigation of the agent, after the agent had testified about being smeared in a conspiracy theory pushed by Jones, who gained notoriety with claims that the Sand Hook attack was staged by the FBI. The agent was awarded nearly $100 million in a case against Jones.\n \n\n   \n  Jones made Martin’s letter public, demanding responses from the FBI agent, until Blanche demanded Martin retract his requests.\n \n\n   \n  Martin then wrote to the agent’s lawyer, “I write to inform you that there is no investigation of you or your client. Because of this, I hereby withdraw my request for information from you or your former client.”\n \n\n   \n    An ally in Virginia\n \n\n   \n  But Martin’s power has accrued alongside the arrival of another former Trump adviser, Halligan, who Trump installed to run the powerful US Attorney’s Office in Alexandria, Virginia, in late September.\n \n\n   \n  While career prosecutors and top Justice officials viewed cases against Comey and James to be duds, Halligan managed to deliver the two indictments Trump publicly called for.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan replaced Erik Seibert after attorneys in the office objected to charging Comey with lying to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Both Comey and James have pleaded not guilty and are challenging the prosecutors’ handling of the cases.\n \n\n   \n  In the James investigation before she was charged, Martin took several steps that fall outside the norms of prosecutorial conduct.\n \n\n   \n  Martin this summer sent a letter to James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, suggesting that James should resign as attorney general. And he paid a visit to James’ Brooklyn  home  in August, posing for photos outside it wearing a long trench coat, accompanied by an assistant who acts as an unofficial spokesperson, unusual for a person in Martin’s position to have at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to go to the very bottom of the facts, and if somebody did something wrong, we’re not only going to hold them accountable. We’re also going to look at everything else that they’ve been doing. Because when you’re a liar, you lie not just on one thing,” Martin said on Fox News in August when asked about the mortgage investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Some senior DOJ officials were frustrated by the stunt, one source said, as they had no idea Martin would be traveling to New York.\n \n\n   \n    Attention in Maryland\n \n\n   \n  Apparently emboldened by the charging successes in Virginia, Martin’s fast-moving advocacy turned in recent weeks to Maryland’s US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The office’s US Attorney Kelly Hayes, a respected career prosecutor who worked for years out of Greenbelt, recently secured the indictment of former Trump national security adviser  John Bolton , another Trump political foe. Prosecutors accuse Bolton of keeping national security secrets in unsecured personal accounts and on printed paper after he left the government.\n \n\n   \n  Hayes’ approach, and the Bolton case itself, are viewed more seriously than the indictments and investigations of other political figures who have faced charges at Trump’s urging, several sources familiar with the case and the office have told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But the Maryland office still has a prosecutor looking into the financial records of Schiff, another Trump target, and Martin continues to push Hayes to bring an indictment against him.\n \n\n   \n  Last week after it became known Hayes’ team had doubts about the case, sources said the investigation was continuing and the Deputy Attorney General’s office may be working with Hayes, in a vote of confidence for the US Attorney in a precarious moment.\n \n\n   \n  Yet because of Martin’s pushes for prosecution in Maryland and Virginia, the districts are now buzzing with speculation Martin could end up as a prosecutor in one of the offices.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/boston-judge-intervene-snap-payments","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:46:00-04:00","title":"Judge Indicates She’ll Intervene in Fight Over SNAP Food Assistance Money","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Boston, Indira Talwani, has signaled that she will intervene in a legal battle over the Trump administration’s decision to withhold SNAP food stamp benefits in November, citing a lack of funds and a clear congressional intent to maintain food assistance during emergencies.

assistance money \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:46 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight over the Trump administration’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to help cover food stamp benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” US District Judge Indira Talwani said near the end of a hearing, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Though the judge’s options vary, one possibility is that she issues an emergency order that essentially compels the administration to tap into the emergency funds. While she indicated from the bench that she was likely to issue a ruling favorable to a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors who sued the administration earlier this week, she acknowledged that benefits, which should start being sent to recipients on November 1, will be delayed.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Talwani said she would work quickly to issue her decision later Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans receive food stamps, a critical piece of the  nation’s safety net.  The program costs roughly $8.5 billion to $9 billion a month, while the contingency fund now has about $5.3 billion in it, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which is representing USDA in the case.\n \n\n   \n  If the judge orders the government to use the emergency funds, it will take time for the US Department of Agriculture and states to get their systems up and running again, which means at least some beneficiaries will likely have to wait for the November allotment.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also unclear whether recipients will receive their full November benefits since the USDA’s contingency fund does not have enough money to cover the entire payments without drawing from other resources. But the Trump administration has shifted money to fund other priorities during the shutdown, including transferring $300 million to keep the  WIC food assistance program  for pregnant women, new moms and young children afloat for October.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the discussion during Thursday’s hearing centered around the fact that the contingency fund contains far less than what is needed to fully cover November benefits for the millions of Americans who receive them. The judge said multiple times that federal law made clear that when the government is unable to pay benefits, it should reduce what it provides, not suspend the program altogether.\n \n\n   \n  “It does seem to me really clear what Congress was trying to do,” Talwani said. “What Congress was trying to do is protect the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger, Talwani added.\n \n\n   \n  A group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC,  sued the administration on Tuesday   over the US Department of Agriculture’s recent decision to not tap into the contingency fund.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, USDA said that it was unable to use the rainy-day fund, reversing course from earlier agency guidance that said such a move was possible. In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene on an emergency basis to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  In the food stamps case, the attorneys general and governors argued the administration was violating federal law that requires the government to consistently fund the food stamps program and that its decision to not tap into the contingency fund ran afoul of federal rulemaking laws.\n \n\n   \n  “USDA suspended SNAP benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November SNAP benefits,” they wrote in the lawsuit. “Suspending SNAP benefits in these circumstances is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.\n \n\n   \n  Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information – ranging from a week before the start of the month to the first day of the month – in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to acknowledging the likely delay in benefits, the judge on Thursday also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney for Massachusetts told Talwani that it would be up to the states to figure out how to reduce payments based on the available federal funds, but an attorney representing the Trump administration pushed back strongly on that idea.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department lawyer, Jason Altabet, said that while it was up to USDA officials to make decisions on reductions in benefit amounts, the agency was extremely concerned about the prospect of having to do that work.\n \n\n   \n    Changing positions\n \n\n   \n  In its shutdown contingency plan, which has since been taken offline, USDA indicated that the contingency fund can be used for benefits in case of a lapse. The plan noted that “Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue.”\n \n\n   \n  But on October 10, the agency began raising red flags, informing states that there is  not enough money  to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues and asking them to hold off on next month’s payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins doubled down on that position the following week, telling reporters that food stamps will run dry by the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  And last week, the USDA said it  will not tap into the fund , stating in a memo that “contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January. But the agency then said it would use a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse to  cover February payments . That workaround ultimately wasn’t needed since the shutdown ended in late January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/democratic-campaign-trail-2028-hopefuls","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:43:00Z","title":"The 2025 Campaign Trail Becomes Popular Stop for Democrats with Eyes on 2028","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, the Democratic Party is using off-year elections—particularly gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia—as a strategic testing ground for future presidential candidates aiming to run in 2028.

Ruben Gallego of Arizona appeared with the party’s nominee Abigail Spanberger to rally Latino voters before holding a similar event with Sherrill in her state this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg and Gallego’s appearances come as the off-year and midterm elections have turned into an early testing ground for 2028 presidential hopefuls – giving them a chance to sharpen their campaign skills outside of their home states and help elevate fellow Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the high-profile Democratic surrogate work has played out in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  But the New York City mayoral race has drawn the progressive star power of hometown Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an ardent backer of Democratic nominee  Zohran Mamdani . And in California,  Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Prop 50 campaign  to push through mid-decade redistricting in his state has further propelled him into the national conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re thinking about future campaigns, it’s smart to have a strategy that’s not just about going to the primary states but also showing that you’re a team player in the Democratic Party and that your message can help turn voters out,” said Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for the Democratic Governors Association.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Buttigieg, a former transportation secretary, touted his work with Sherrill to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel project, a rail project between New Jersey and New York City that Trump said he had “terminated” earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg described the move as “mob boss politics” and criticized Sherrill’s  Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli  for not having “the backbone” to push back on the president.\n \n\n   \n  “This state needs a governor who can think for herself, and someone who will put the best interest of the state first. And there’s only one candidate who will do that,” Buttigieg said at an event with Sherrill at a Westfield, NJ, train station.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg was slated later Thursday to help turn out voters in Red Bank and raise money for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. His appearances with Sherrill came one week after he headlined an event with Spanberger and Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of his stop with Sherrill this week, Buttigieg sent an e-mail to his fundraising list saying he was “back on the campaign trail” to help candidates across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Gallego, who has said the Democratic Party needs to do more to win back Latino voters, is tapped this week with taking that pitch to Latino communities in Virginia and New Jersey, a state where the  Latino vote could be key  to picking the next governor.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, all we want is to have a chance at the American Dream, to be able to build a family here, to have a chance to continue to grow this country and the beautiful vision that everyone has,” Gallego said Thursday at a “Latinos for Spanberger” event in Alexandria, Virginia. “And this is why we as Latinos have to come out and vote today and all the way until Tuesday, because the only way we get that dream is when we have friends that care about us.”\n \n\n   \n    Big names out on the campaign trail for Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Several sitting Democratic governors potentially eyeing higher office have descended on New Jersey and Virginia to give a boost to the women they hope will join their ranks next year. That includes Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore; Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro; and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  “The big names you’re hearing in the Democratic Party are more and more governors,” said Leopold. “It’s especially helpful if you’re running for governor to have a governor campaign with you to show the executive experience and show what a governor can do.”\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker  has been a frequent surrogate for Sherrill in his home state. Other high-profile Democratic surrogates who have hit the campaign trail in New Jersey or Virginia this year include Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; California Rep. Ro Khanna and former US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, who is now a CNN commentator.\n \n\n   \n  “These are the type of leaders that are focused on the everyday problems, the everyday concerns of Americans, and that can be the type of leaders that re-earn the faith of the American people,” Beshear, vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said of Sherrill and Spanberger during a virtual event with the Democratic National Committee Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also have helped raise money for the off-year candidates. Newsom, who has said he will make a  decision about 2028  after the midterms, participated in a virtual fundraiser with Sherrill for New Jersey’s Democratic campaigns and state committee, a source familiar with the event said. Meanwhile, Pritzker has donated six-figures across the New Jersey and Virginia races, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  While 2028 hopefuls on the Democratic side have eagerly stumped during this year’s off-year elections, the Republican side has not drawn as much attention from presidential aspirants.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz joined Virginia’s Republican gubernatorial nominee  Winsome Earle-Sears  last week for a fundraiser. New Jersey’s GOP gubernatorial nominee Ciattarelli has recently campaigned with Rep. Byron Donalds, who is running for governor in Florida in 2026. Trump also held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli this month.\n \n\n   \n  Though New Jersey and Virginia have seen frequent visits from high-profile Democrats, the New York City mayoral race has not drawn as many national party figures to campaign on behalf of Mamdani, a democratic socialist.\n \n\n   \n  But  he has received a boost  from Ocasio-Cortez and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders – both popular figures with the progressive base who are able to draw large crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m talking to you, Donald Trump,” Ocasio-Cortez declared at a rally last weekend, saying that “we will work our hearts out to elect Zohran Kwame Mamdani as the next mayor of the great city of New York.”\n \n\n   \n  While each of these high-profile Democrats has taken a turn on the campaign stage, former President Barack Obama remains the party’s most sought-after surrogate. He’s taped ads for Sherrill and Spanberger and will campaign in-person for the two Democratic candidates in their states on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  But the Democratic party’s most recent leaders – former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Joe Biden – have not appeared on this year’s campaign trail as Democrats still grapple with the fallout of last year’s election.\n \n\n   \n  Harris, who has left the door open to a possible run in 2028, sent a fundraising e-mail on behalf of Sherrill this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Again and again, Mikie has shown that she is not afraid of a tough fight, and that she will stand up to anyone who attacks the rights, freedoms, or livelihoods of the people she serves,” Harris wrote. “That is exactly the kind of leadership we need right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden has not made any campaign stops since leaving office but is scheduled to appear at a political event for the Nebraska Democratic Party three days after Tuesday’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Biden was one of the Democratic Party’s most active surrogates for the midterm elections, stumping for candidates in places like Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. He launched his presidential campaign the following spring.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a new crop of Democrats is trying to chart its own path to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the start, 2025,” said Leopold. “And you’re going to see a lot more of it in 2026.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/entertainment/scream-stranger-things-trailers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:45:00Z","title":"‘Tis the (spooky) season: ‘Scream 7’ and ‘Stranger Things 5’ trailers deliver double dose of scares","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Halloween Eve, 2025, trailers for 'Scream 7' and the final season of 'Stranger Things' were released, capitalizing on the spooky season and fan anticipation.

“Stranger Things 5” on the same day, also known as Halloween eve.\n \n\n   \n  The latest in the “Scream” franchise reunites stars Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox as part of a cast which also includes several others, including Isabel May, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Joel McHale, Mckenna Grace and Mark Consuelos.

I thought I had died,” Abby Zwerner said Thursday, shortly before her attorneys rested their case, recounting the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner raised her hand instinctively as she realized what the student was going to do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The look on the student’s face is the large memory that I have,” Zwerner said Thursday. “It was like a very blank look, but it wasn’t a blank look at all.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN All Access has live coverage of teacher shot by student trial \n \n\n   \n  One of Zwerner’s last memories at the school the day she was shot, she said, was thinking, “I was on my way to heaven or in heaven.”\n \n\n   \n  “My next memory is I see two coworkers around me,” Zwerner said. “I process that I’m hurt, and they’re putting pressure on where I’m hurt.”\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million lawsuit against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  The civil trial offers a peek inside some of the key details that will be presented during the criminal case next month against Parker, who faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect.\n \n\n   \n  Filing charges against school officials in the aftermath of a school shooting is rare, a law professor at the University of Virginia told CNN, and this case could set a precedent for future events as US communities grapple with questions of responsibility after a school is scarred by gun violence.\n \n\n   \n  It remains an increasingly pervasive problem: As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States so far this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n    Official ignored warning signs, lawsuit alleges\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner described the consequences of the physical trauma wrought by the shooting. Because of her injury, which prompted multiple surgeries, Zwerner is unable to fully use her left hand to this day, she said. \n \n\n   \n  “Overall, I would say I do struggle with things, doing things,” she said, like opening a bag of chips and water bottles. \n \n\n   \n  She also testified to lingering emotional trauma such as being afraid to go out in public with her mother and sister and feeling distant from friends. \n \n\n   \n  “I just want to stay home,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The  lawsuit alleges  Parker ignored concerns raised by several teachers and staff members, including that the student may have had a gun in his possession hours before the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Parker is accused of ignoring “warnings from teachers and staff that students had seen the firearm” and that the student had “removed an object that was likely a firearm from his backpack before it was searched,” the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  A guidance counselor and administrator at the school said Parker also “forbade” teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his mother would pick him up soon, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was required to be accompanied by a parent at school “because of his violent tendencies.” But the day of the shooting, school administrators “allowed him to remain unaccompanied,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  During the previous school year, the boy strangled and choked a teacher and pulled up a female classmate’s dress and touched her inappropriately on the school playground, the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  Poor decisions led up to the “avoidable” shooting, a grand jury report found last April.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorney has previously not responded to CNN’s request for comment. On Thursday, during cross-examination, an attorney for Parker worked to undercut Zwerner’s claims about the shooting, limiting her willingness to go out in public.   \n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had attended concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until after her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Parker resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal was reassigned to another school. The incident also led the school board to vote out the superintendent.\n \n\n   \n    Teacher’s witnesses describe emotional toll\n \n\n   \n  The third day of testimony began with Zwerner’s attorneys calling to the stand a psychiatrist who testified Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner had overcome mental stressors in the past, Dr. Clarence Watson testified, like when she had a heavy workload in college or soon after her father’s sudden death. But the shooting was “like throwing gasoline on top of the fire,” causing her recurring nightmares.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Zwerner wiped away tears as her twin sister reflected Wednesday on the   changes she’s seen in Zwerner since the first-grade teacher was shot by her 6-year-old student more than two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s just not the person that she was,” Hannah Zwerner told the court, saying the shooting dimmed a sister who used to be a bright light.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a lot to be excited about. And she doesn’t anymore.”\n \n\n   \n    Injuries were devastating\n \n\n   \n  The chief of surgery where Zwerner was hospitalized testified Tuesday her injuries were life-threatening. Her lung collapsed and the bullet that remains inside Zwerner’s body just missed her heart, Daniel Munn said. An orthopedic trauma surgeon testified about the details of Zwerner’s devastating hand injury, her multiple surgeries and ongoing recovery.\n \n\n   \n  After two weeks in the hospital and six surgeries, Zwerner is left with a hand that will never be normal, orthopedic surgeon James Stuart told the court.\n \n\n   \n  A now-retired corporal from the Newport News Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about his response to the scene after the shooting. “We were quite taken aback. We didn’t expect to see so young a suspect,” the corporal testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s lawyers also introduced body cam footage and police scene photographs into evidence.\n \n\n   \n    School official is only defendant\n \n\n   \n  Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit. A judge previously dismissed the others, including the Newport News School Board, the district’s former superintendent and the former school principal, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  The student’s mother was  sentenced  to a total of nearly four years in prison for    child neglect and federal weapons charges.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was  not charged  with any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The gun used in the shooting was purchased by the boy’s mother, kept on the top shelf of her closet and was secured by a trigger lock, an attorney for the mother  previously told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  However, prosecutors  later said  authorities found no trigger lock and no key to a trigger lock. The boy stood on a dresser drawer and took the gun from his mother’s purse.  ﻿ He then brought the gun to school in his backpack, police said.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s mother had no criminal record and cooperated with authorities since the shooting. She  turned herself in  to police after state charges were filed  against her and was released after posting a $5,000 bond.\n \n\n   \n    Case could set precedent\n \n\n   \n  Because attempts to hold school officials criminally accountable for school shootings are rare, this case could set a precedent, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  The closest thing to something like the case against Parker is when charges were filed against the deputy who stayed outside during the mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, he said. The deputy in that case  was acquitted  on all counts against him in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  As of October 26, there have been  356 mass shootings  in the US this year, leaving  at least 300 people dead  and 1,600 injured,  according to  data from the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one that injured or killed four or more people.\n \n\n   \n  Charging school officials for neglect appears to be an “emerging strategy,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to be kind of the only strategy left that we can put responsibility on the people who provide access to guns, at least to children, at least to school children and children under 16 or 18,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the civil trial could be a “dry run” for what’s to come in the criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone on both sides the prosecution and the defense should have a very clear idea of what the evidence is going to be and what the witnesses are going to say,” the professor said.\n \n\n   \n  The cases could end up setting “a very big” precedent and lead to school officials more aware of their duties to act on any information they have about a child with a gun or who poses a danger to students and staff, Brown said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5592332","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:07:00-04:00","title":"Photos: Food banks scramble to get ready as SNAP funding deadline looms","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the government shutdown nears its critical point, 42 million SNAP beneficiaries in the U.S. face imminent food insecurity when their EBT card funds expire on Nov 1.

  \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The neurologic disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE has most often been found in people who experienced repeated blows to the head while playing contact sports and there’s now  evidence  of genetic damage inside the brain, too.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers examined the brains of football players and others with the  rare neurological disease , and the genetic damage they found looks similar to what they see in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. The damage was so extensive that it was the equivalent of hundreds of years of aging.\n \n\n   \n  CTE typically develops years after someone has received repeated blows to the head. Symptoms can include memory loss, impulse control problems, anxiety, depression and anger issues. It’s most often seen in people who play sports like football, hockey and soccer, but it’s also been detected in the brains of soldiers who have been injured in explosions and in some people who experienced domestic violence.\n \n\n   \n  The disease was first identified nearly 100 years ago in boxers – at the time, scientists called it  “punch-drunk syndrome”  – but there’s still much that experts don’t know about CTE. Not everyone with repeated head trauma develops the condition, and scientists don’t totally understand why or even how head trauma can lead to this disease.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Chris Walsh, co-author of the  study published Thursday  in the journal Science, says there are still people who deny that CTE is even a disease. The latest research, he said, should change naysayers’ minds.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel like this study helps establish that CTE is something distinct from just repetitive head trauma. It represents a more gradually developing pathological process and is a well-defined entity,” said Walsh, who is chief of the Division of Genetics and Genomics at Boston Children’s Hospital and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.” We suspect it involves immune activation in a way similar to Alzheimer’s disease.”\n \n\n   \n  At this point, scientists don’t have a simple blood test or scan that can detect CTE   in a living person. The only way to make  a definitive diagnosis  is to take thin slices of the brain after the person’s death and use a microscope to look for an abnormal accumulation of tau, a protein that stabilizes certain elements of the brain. Too much tau can damage blood vessels and brain cells, and this buildup is also a hallmark   of Alzheimer’s.\n \n\n   \n  The brain is made up of a mosaic of cells that each have their own genome. Every time a stem cell divides, it accumulates mutations. The new study used sequencing and amplification technology only recently made available to look at the genes of single cells in hundreds of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain used for decision-making and other thinking skills.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers compared the results from four groups: 15 people who had repeated hits to the brain and were diagnosed with CTE; four people who had repeated head injuries but hadn’t developed CTE; 19 people without a history of head injuries or signs of CTE; and seven people who had Alzheimer’s.\n \n\n   \n  Among the people with CTE, the cells showed genomic damage that looked similar to the brains of people who had Alzheimer’s. The people who had repeated brain trauma but were not diagnosed with CTE did not have the same kind of damage.\n \n\n   \n  “Cells carry a bar code of their whole developmental history, including reflecting environmental influences, and that’s what’s happening in CTE,” Walsh explained. “The abnormal environment created by the repeated trauma damages the genomes of the cells.”\n \n\n   \n  With better understanding of the mechanisms that cause CTE, Walsh hopes the work can eventually lead to developing treatments. Because brain damage with CTE looks similar to Alzheimers, it may even be possible to use therapies for CTE patients that helped people with Alzheimer’s, but much more research will be needed before that could happen.\n \n\n   \n  The new study builds on recent research indicating that brain damage from repeated blows to the head can show up much earlier than the excessive tau markers that are seen with CTE become clear.\n \n\n   \n  A  2023 study  showed that the brain’s immune cells were increasingly activated in proportion to the number of years an athlete played contact sports, suggesting that early cellular damage may be setting the stage for the disease to progress.\n \n\n   \n  A  2020 study  also found that the risk of CTE doubles for every 2.6 years spent playing football. The condition has been reported in people as young as 17, meaning by the time a football player goes pro, they have experienced hundreds of thousands of hits to the head, and that damage seems to be adding up.\n \n\n   \n  The NFL has implemented several rule and equipment changes to reduce the number of head injuries, and the number of concussions has declined, with data from the  2024 season  showing the lowest number of concussions since tracking began in 2015.   Other sports leagues including the NHL, MLS and the English Premier League have also made changes to reduce the number of concussions among their playeres.\n \n\n   \n  But experts say it’s not just concussions that are the problem; any hit to the head can cause damage. Some suggest that if children really want to play football, their parents might skip early leagues, which can start as early as age 5, and instead wait until children turn 14 or 18 to let them play tackle football. The American Youth Soccer Organization doesn’t recommend heading the ball before the age of 10, and coaches are not encouraged to teach or practice heading at early ages.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/science/dueling-dinosaurs-fossil-nanotyrannus-tyrannosaurus-rex","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:03:00Z","title":"Dueling dinosaurs' fossil forces a radical rethink of T. rex remains","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fossil long believed to depict a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex locked in combat with a Triceratops has been reevaluated by researchers from Stony Brook University and North Carolina State University.

Or so paleontologists thought.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers who spent the past five years studying the stunning collection of bones called the “dueling dinosaurs” say they have uncovered a case of mistaken identity, determining that the small-bodied dinosaur was not a juvenile T. Rex but rather a fully grown example of a hotly debated species known as Nanotyrannus lancensis.\n \n\n   \n  “We have the growth record preserved in the microstructure of the bone, which shows that it’s an adult,” said James Napoli, a vertebrate paleontologist at Stony Brook University and coauthor of the new study published Thursday  in the journal Nature.  The discovery has triggered a rethink of many other fossils previously identified as teenage T. rex remains, Napoli added.\n \n\n   \n  While similar in appearance, the two dinosaur species would have been very different: Nanotyrannus was 18 feet long, agile and built for speed, with long legs and strong arms to grasp prey, while 42-foot-long T. rex had stocky legs and used its devastating bite to devour huge, slow-moving dinos.\n \n\n   \n  Despite its relatively diminutive size, Napoli said that Nanotyrannus had larger upper limbs than a fully grown T. rex, which had famously tiny arms. “Bones don’t shrink when animals grow so this could not have possibly become an (adult) T. rex,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The finding “flips decades of T. rex research on its head,” according to study coauthor Lindsay Zanno, associate research professor at North Carolina State University and head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.\n \n\n   \n  “A wealth of studies on the biology of T. rex over the past three decades have unknowingly mixed data from Nanotyrannus with that of T. rex. Those studies need to be reevaluated in light of this discovery,” Zanno said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The dueling dinosaurs  fossil was first discovered 2006 , exposed as sedimentary rock eroded from the Hell Creek Formation, which dates back 65.5 million years and stretches across parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.\n \n\n   \n    Mistaken identity\n \n\n   \n  Nanotyrannus lancensis, which like T. rex is part of the larger tyrannosaurid family in taxonomic classification, was first identified from a fossil unearthed in the 1940s from the same rock formation as the dueling dinosaurs.\n \n\n   \n  However, scientists later shifted the narrative and interpreted that initial find and many other small Tyrannosaur fossils uncovered in the following decades to be juvenile T. rex specimens. The idea that another species might have produced the fossils fell out of favor, though the possibility was still debated at scientific conferences and other forums.\n \n\n   \n  The new research, which examined and compared over 200 Tyrannosaur fossils, suggests that juvenile T. rex fossils were not as common in the fossil record as paleontologists previously thought. For years, the study authors reported, paleontologists have misidentified Nanotyrannus fossils as juvenile T. rex specimens and used the morphological features of the remains to  model T. rex growth and behavior .\n \n\n   \n  “What’s exciting is that this discovery opens the door to a whole series of new questions about how these different predators — one built for brute strength and one built for speed — interacted in the twilight of the dinosaurs,” Zanno said.\n \n\n   \n  The study authors said they also had identified a fossil called “Jane” as a  second species of Nanotyrannus , which they dubbed Nanotyrannus lethaeus. The name is a reference to the River Lethe, the river of forgetfulness in Greek mythology, a nod to how this dinosaur remained hidden in plain sight and “forgotten” for decades.\n \n\n   \n    Uncomfortable questions\n \n\n   \n  The finding raises “uncomfortable” questions about why a scientific consensus came together so quickly around the idea that all Nanotyrannus specimens are juvenile T. rexes, said Larry Witmer, Chang Ying-Chien Professor of Paleontology at Ohio University. Witmer didn’t take part in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Many T. rex fossils, which can sell for  tens of millions of dollars at auction , were commercially collected and are in private hands, making them difficult to study, he noted in a commentary published alongside the research.\n \n\n   \n  “This exceptionally researched study by Zanno and Napoli puts Nanotyrannus on a solid foundation,” Witmer said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the implications of the findings go beyond settling a scientific disagreement.\n \n\n   \n  “There is much more at stake here than declaring a victor in the debate, because there are literally decades of research and probably hundreds of publications based on a premise that this article overturns,” he said. “These analyses will all need revision.”\n \n\n   \n  Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology at the University of Edinburgh said the finding should prompt “a fundamental reassessment of tyrannosaur classification and evolution.”\n \n\n   \n  “For many years in my research on tyrannosaurs, I’ve considered a set of smaller skeletons found in the same rocks as the famous skeletons of huge T. rexes to be juveniles of T. rex rather than a distinctive smaller species,” Brusatte, who wasn’t involved with the new study, explained.\n \n\n   \n  “Reading this new paper, I think new evidence from this exquisite new specimen in the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences shows that I was wrong — at least in part,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  However, not every smaller tyrannosaur skeleton should be classified as Nanotyrannus, according to Brusatte. “T. rex was the size of a bus as an adult, and bones of adult T. rexes are very common across western North America, from Saskatchewan down to New Mexico,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Some of these must be juvenile T. rexes, and I think it is ultimately going to be very hard to tell apart adult or near-adult Nanotyrannus from teenage T. rex, as they were probably both very similar in size, and in their skeletal features,” he noted. “That will be the challenge for future paleontologists.”\n \n\n   \n  The evidence presented in the study that the smaller animal in the dueling dinosaurs fossil is in fact Nanotyrannus is “pretty conclusive,” according to Thomas Carr, a senior scientific advisor at the Dinosaur Discovery Museum and an associate professor of biology at Carthage College. However, fresh fossils are needed to understand the differences between Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named species of Nanotyrannus lethaeus, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Carr also said he isn’t sure about whether the fossil “Jane” should be reclassified as Nanotyrannus lethaeus, as the new research suggests. “They’ve done strong work, but we must be cautious,” said Carr, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Napoli said dueling dinosaurs, which is still partially encased in rock, has many more secrets to spill. Scientists still don’t know how the two animals died — or why they were found entangled. But the Nanotyrannus specimen is 100% complete, which is extraordinarily rare in the fossil record, Napoli noted.\n \n\n   \n  “There are some bones that are partially broken with a piece missing, but every individual bone is represented to some degree,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers hope skin or feathers might also be preserved in the sediment surrounding the remains and that there are injuries on the specimen, such as a broken finger, they haven’t yet explored.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a tremendous amount of science to do on the dueling dinosaurs,” Napoli said. “It’s an amazing fossil to work on.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5592366","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:43:00-04:00","title":"Federal judges order administration to pay SNAP benefits but what's next remains unclear","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two federal judges, Indira Talwani in Boston and John J.

But it was unclear hours after the rulings Friday afternoon how much assistance may be provided or when it might come. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits. She declined to issue a temporary restraining order to force the administration to act before the funds run out tomorrow, finding that resuming payments at some point can still avoid irreparable harm to SNAP recipients. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order while saying ending SNAP payments would harm not only people, but also local economies. The judge said the Trump administration \"must distribute\" aid from emergency reserves as soon as possible. He also said it must submit a plan on how it would comply with his order, or \"at least an update,\" by noon on Monday,  Ocean State Media reported. It is not yet clear how the two court orders would impact the flow of benefits, which are set to run out Saturday. Hours after the rulings, President Trump posted on social media that he has directed government lawyers to find a way to pay SNAP benefits. \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" he wrote. However, it's not clear what sort of legal direction the administration was seeking.

She issued her decision in a case filed by two dozen Democratic-led states that sued over the administration's decision to suspend the nation's largest anti-hunger program for the first time in its history. The judge said the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going. She also said other money is legally available but left the decision of how much benefits to distribute up to the administration.

Dictionary.com's 2025 word of the year has no definition \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 1:43 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Dictionary.com has crowned a set of numbers as its 2025 word of the year. It  says it reserves  that distinction for a word that reflects \"social trends and global events that defined that year\" and \"reveals the stories we tell about ourselves and how we've changed over the year.\" The word of the year is both viral vernacular and a linguistic time capsule (last year's, for example, was \" demure \"). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This year, that honor goes to \"67\" — pronounced \"six seven\" — a slang term that's been delighting kids,  exasperating teachers  and befuddling adults for months. It has its roots in the song  \"Doot Doot (6 7)\" , which Philadelphia-based rapper Skrilla released last December. \"The way that switch brrt, I know he dyin' … 6-7, I just bipped right on the highway,\" Skrilla says, using a verb that in hip-hop can describe anything from a  car smash-and-grab  to smooth driving to  general swag. But it was the phrase \"67\" that   took off. It was popularized online largely through viral TikToks of basketball highlights  including of LaMelo Ball , the Charlotte Hornets point guard who happens to stand 6 feet, 7 inches tall. Then other big-name basketball players, including  LeBron James  and  Paige Bueckers , started using the term in interviews. It spread to  other sports  and, before long, schools across the country.   Gen Alpha typically delivers it in a slow drawl with an accompanying hand motion: raising one upturned palm at a time for each number, as if weighing two items. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Now it is something that you're just trying to use to get somebody to reference the number 67   like … 'How tall are you?'… 'what time is it?' … 'what's that?'\" middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay, who  first posted  about the trend back in February, said in an  August Instagram video . \"There is literally no circumstance where a kid might not say 67.\" Dictionary.com says searches for 67 surged over the summer, increasing \"more than sixfold\" since June with no signs of stopping. The term has inspired  musical mashups , a recent  South Park  plotline  and plenty of (somewhat cringe)  Halloween costumes . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"67 shows the speed at which a new word can rocket around the world as a rising generation enters the global conversation,\" its announcement reads. Lindsay approves of the choice, telling NPR over email that 67 is \"definitely THE word of 2025.\" He says that while kids tend to lose interest in memes over time, especially as they move across generations, this one has held staying power for nearly the entire year — though its new accolade could potentially change that.  \"I would imagine after this designation and more people using it, that it is going to start to become cringe to the younger generation,\" he wrote. \"However, I do think that because they are numbers that are seen everywhere, it is going to live on for quite some time in classrooms and in the minds of Gen Alpha.\"  But what does it actually mean? Depends on who you ask  Dictionary.com says: \"Perhaps the most defining feature of 67 is that it's impossible to define.\" \"It's meaningless, ubiquitous, and nonsensical,\" it adds. \"It's the logical endpoint of being perpetually online, scrolling endlessly, consuming content fed to users by algorithms trained by other algorithms.\" In other words, the defining world of the year has no real meaning or definition. Even Skrilla, the rapper who coined the term,  told  XXL  magazine  this week that he left it intentionally vague, though it initially had a negative connotation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"67 changed from a negative thing to a positive,\" he said. \"[It's] millions of other things for other people. Everybody got they own meaning to it, 'cause I never put a real meaning on it.\" Ball, the 6-foot-7 basketball player, similarly struggled to define it when asked in a  September TikTok . \"It's really nothing though, for real,\" the 24-year-old said. \"Just six seven.\" Still, as Dictionary.com says, the term's meaning lies in the connection it fosters. It's basically one big inside joke, at least for participants of a certain age. \"67 is meaningless in content, but it's not meaningless in feeling,\" parenting expert Becky Kennedy said in an  Instagram video  earlier this month. \"Think about when you were a kid. What's more powerful than feeling like you belong?\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Evidently, that feeling is powerful enough to propel 67 to the word of the year — beating out a shortlist of contenders including  broligarchy ,  clanker ,  tradwife  and  tariff . Lindsay says he's gotten \"countless\" messages from parents who have connected with their kids \"over a 6-7 and have been able to have meaningful conversations as a result.\" He hopes others will embrace it similarly.  \"Every trending meme or word is a connection point between adults and the adolescents in their life,\" he adds. \"My advice is always, know what is going on and use it to bridge gaps with the kids in your life.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, showcasing live music performances in a minimalist setting, highlighting the artistic and cultural value of intimate musical expressions.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","Music","Live Performance","Artistic Expression"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589849","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-14","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Global Climate Action: Progress, Challenges, and the Path Forward in 2023","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing global response to climate change, emphasizing the role of international cooperation, youth activism, and comprehensive policy frameworks.

Here's what that means across the country \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Updated Friday, October 31, 2025 • 7:34 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The federal government shutdown has dragged into another week, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to ending it. Many  federal workers have missed paychecks , including  air traffic controllers , who are working unpaid.  Meanwhile,  uncertainty remains  for  tens of millions of people  who rely on  federal food and nutrition benefits  like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. The benefits had been set to expire on Saturday due to the government shutdown. Two federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide the benefits. But it was unclear after the rulings how much assistance may be provided or when it might come. Read the latest about the pair of SNAP rulings   and also, learn  how some food banks are bracing for SNAP funding to lapse The  Agriculture Department says  it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to  help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid . At the same time  many American farmers  say the Trump administration's trade policies have them on the brink. As the shutdown continues, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down? A  partisan argument  over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some  24 million people  — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.  Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is  not true . Democrats in the Senate  refused to vote  for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP  spending and tax bill  that passed over the summer. NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a  key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock . That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when subscribers could  see big premium increases  unless the subsidies that have been helping people pay for coverage since 2021 are extended. Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here. Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as  a health care showdown . —  Selena Simmons-Duffin , NPR What about WIC and SNAP benefits ? Federal food subsidies could be cut off on Saturday for millions of Americans due to the government shutdown. Of those at risk of  losing food and nutrition aid  are 7 million receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Nearly 42 million who rely on SNAP could also lose their benefits. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the  program will run out of money Nov. 1 .  The Trump administration had said it did not have enough money to pay November's SNAP benefits because of the government shutdown, and lacked legal authority to use contingency funds set aside for emergencies. On Friday, two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide SNAP benefits. One judge in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits. Another judge in Rhode Island granted a temporary restraining order, saying ending SNAP payments would harm not only people, but also local economies. The judge said the Trump administration \"must distribute\" aid from emergency reserves as soon as possible.  It is not yet clear how the two court orders would impact the flow of benefits. Hours after the rulings, Trump posted on social media that he has directed government lawyers to find a way to pay SNAP benefits. \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" he wrote. However, it's not clear what sort of legal direction the administration was seeking. WIC was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration  shifted $300 million in tariff revenue  to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's  calling for an additional $300 million  to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some  states  could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources. —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR Read more on the impact of this potential lapse across the country, here.  — and you can  read more here about how food banks are bracing for it   What about Head Start? Beginning Nov. 1,  more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start , the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down. Among the states  hit hardest  by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio. Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support. Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out. Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences. —  Cory Turner  and  Kadin Mills , NPR What the shutdown means for federal workers Altogether,  about 1.4 million civilian federal employees  across the country are going without pay,  according to the Bipartisan Policy Center , a think tank in Washington, D.C. Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over. The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but   the White House has tried to cast doubt on that. The Senate has  failed to advance a pair of competing measures  to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.  The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security. Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to   further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court ;  the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday  indefinitely halted  the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units. How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?  The White House has identified additional funding for the latest round of military paychecks despite the shutdown, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget. The spokesperson says that the agency is using around $5 billion from a military housing fund, a military research and development fund and a Defense Department account used for building ships. NPR asked if part of the money is also coming from a $130 million donation made by a billionaire Trump ally, but the OMB did not respond. The Trump administration  earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay many active military members  so they wouldn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly.  Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,\" according to a  statement by USPS . The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A  contingency plan  from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees  were issued  reduction in force, or RIF, notices  on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data. —  Scott Horsley ,  Andrea Hsu  and  Stephen Fowler , NPR National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines. According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\" Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week. —  Geoff Brumfiel , NPR In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting  more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada  could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open. Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees  have been temporary furloughed , as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans. At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly  $15 billion  in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. The courts  have halted  those layoffs. If they're ultimately allowed to go through, multiple sources told NPR the special education office would be left with just a handful of top executives and support staff. In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed  were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is  suing the Trump administration  for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. —  Shannon Bond  and  Cory Turner , NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's  Corrinne Hess  reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that  student financial aid programs will continue , despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have  brought their operations to a halt . That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise  reports that the Smithsonian assured the public  that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure.  Animal cams  are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As  KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported , a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support WBUR's Andrea Shea reports  that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open. Shea reports that  NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs  through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security,   VA  and other benefits will continue. But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the  government shutdown  has left them  unable to carry out an important service for some recipients . As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These  official letters  act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits. In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters. Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week,  the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year , or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.

ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said. According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown. \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\"  Noem posted on X  last week. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\" The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid,  according to Noem ; funds will be appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year. —  Ximena Bustillo , NPR If you're flying soon … Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job. This week they officially missed their first full paycheck since the shutdown began.  Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages  disrupt flights across the country . Air traffic controllers  helped to end the last government shutdown , and could help end this one as well. According to NPR's Joel Rose, the Transportation Department says  there has been an uptick in the number of controllers  who are calling in sick. The Transportation Department says that federal subsidies for rural air travel will continue through Nov. 18,  reports Alaska Public Media's Eric Stone . The department previously said it had enough funding to continue the program through Sunday.

NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. At an indoor play center in Cheyenne, Wyo., a sea of toddlers throw around colorful blocks and balls. Grace Moreno, who is 21, is there with her 11-month-old son, who is dressed in pajamas with little firetrucks on them. \"It's the only free place, so it's worth it,\" she said. Finances are tight for Moreno and her husband. They moved to Wyoming from Texas, while pregnant, so her husband could work a higher-paying electrician job. But now that they are parents, paychecks seem to disappear. \"Our rent in Texas was like $800,\" Moreno said. \"Here, it's like $1,775.\" Rent is their biggest cost. They spend $300 a week on groceries and $100 on formula. The couple also have car payments, and they're paying bills for their son's delivery. \"I remember sitting there looking at a stack of mail, probably like maybe 3 inches tall … hospital bills, ER bills,\" Moreno recalled.  \"And I looked at my husband. I was like, 'I don't ever want to do this again.'\" Just too expensive to have kids Months earlier, she thought she'd have multiple kids. But just six weeks after giving birth, Moreno decided to have her tubes tied. \"I was kind of like, 'Oh my gosh, my mom was right. This is too expensive.'\" Having only one kid means Moreno's family can save a couple of hundred dollars a month for a mortgage, so their son can someday have a backyard. \"Not only are homes more expensive, but then add, you know, a 7% [mortgage interest] rate on top of that,\" said Emily Harris, senior demographer at the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah. She said the  rate  at which women are having babies in Wyoming is just above the national average but still too low to replace the state's population. The same is true for all other states in the Mountain West, which have seen some of the  largest drops  in fertility rates nationwide in the past two decades. Meanwhile, the region's population is still growing. A lot of people are moving here to escape bigger cities and for an outdoor lifestyle, which is driving up home costs. Harris said things like child care costs and generational values also play into people's childbearing decisions and that they're definitely changing. \"We have this idea of, like, the nuclear family,\" Harris said. \"You need to get married, and then you buy a home and then you have children …  and really over the last decade or two, that kind of timeline has been halted and kind of rearranged.\" Some states are passing laws aimed at  easing housing costs  for young families. But  not Wyoming. \"The biggest barrier to addressing this housing crisis is really convincing my colleagues that the government has a role to play,\" said state Rep. Trey Sherwood, a member of the Democratic minority. Progressives have pushed for a state fund to help build more affordable housing. But members of the Republican supermajority, like Sen. Bob Ide, say the government should stay out of it. \"Fiddling with housing, you know, it gums up the wheels of the free market,\" Ide said. He pointed to laws the Wyoming Legislature passed to  restrict abortion access , allow nannies  to care for more children  and  ease property taxes  as examples of family-friendly policies. But Wyoming couples like Reesie Lane and Sean Thornton say it's still just too expensive to have kids now. \"Sean and I started dating and he said, 'I don't know, I think I want to have like six or seven kids,'\" Lane said, as Thornton laughed. \"[But] as we went through more and more financial struggles I guess, eventually it came to like, 'Yeah, I think we can have like one or two,'\" she added. Lane and Thornton both work in the state university system. They spent their 20s struggling to pay rent in tiny apartments, and then around age 30, they finally bought a house. \"I think that's when we started to realize it might be too late,\" said Lane, who also has an ovarian syndrome that makes it hard to conceive. \" I'm not sure that we're going to be able to have children.\" Lane said it's heartbreaking to not have enough money to give even one kid a full life, but that it's also freeing. For now, they're content with their fur babies, a Pomeranian and a shih tzu mix that were dressed in matching bandanas with fall leaves. \"They're a hundred percent little babies,\" Lane said, holding up the well-dressed pups, Huckleberry and Finn. \"They're so spoiled.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5585063","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"I Love LA is a self-aware comedy for the chronically online","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"I Love LA, a self-aware comedy created by Rachel Sennott and aired on HBO, centers on a group of friends navigating the highs and lows of fame and ambition in Los Angeles, with the city itself emerging as a central character.

   By Teresa Xie \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 8:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         On the surface, Rachel Sennott's  I Love LA  is about a tight-knit, ambitious friend group learning to navigate life and love in LA. That's how HBO describes the series, at least. From this, one might assume that  I Love LA  is the newest addition to a roster of shows that includes the likes of  Friends ,  Girls  and  Broad City  — beloved coming-of-age series that center friendships where the focus is, at its core, the characters' relationships to others and self. But in  I Love LA , Los Angeles is the character in question. Unlike its peers, the new HBO series   is less interested in the dynamics of the friend group itself and more concerned with the far-reaching tentacles of a city that has the power to make you as quickly as it can eat you alive — all while documenting your rise and fall on the internet.  I Love LA  revolves around a 20-something talent manager named Maia, played by Rachel Sennott, who decides to take on her former best friend and rising social media star, Tallulah (Odessa A'zion), as a client. Their circle is comprised of Charlie (Jordan Firstman), an insecure stylist who desperately cares about climbing LA's social ladder, and Alani (True Whitaker), the show's (and real life) nepo baby. Each character seems to represent a modern Los Angeles stereotype, with the exception of Dylan (Josh Hutcherson), who plays the voice of reason as the supportive, lowkey boyfriend to an ambitious, extraverted Maia. With a cast including cameos from former vine star Quenlin Blackwell,  I Love LA  intentionally taps those who have come up online in one way or another, many alongside Sennott, who was initially known for her Twitter comedy and went viral in 2019 for mocking LA in  an Instagram video set to Azealia Banks' \"212.\" The show begins with Tallulah coming back to Maia's life after a lengthy falling out. When Tallulah shows up unexpectedly at Maia's apartment with a Balenciaga bag and thousands of Instagram followers under her belt, the show's primary conflict seems to be between the two of them, because:  is being the manager of your former best friend really the best idea?  But as the season unfolds and Maia gets increasingly wrapped up in their careers, it becomes clear that the real tension isn't entirely interpersonal, but rather lies between each character and a city that is trying to break them under the warmth of its sun-kissed glow.  For many people who grew up on the internet, LA has a reputation of being a theme park for social media influencers, nepo babies and washed up YouTubers. And to that,  I Love LA  says, you're right. The show understands that in order for viewers to take it seriously, it cannot do the same. When Maia finds out on her 27th birthday that Tallulah was in the Marc Jacobs' Heaven campaign without her, a nod to the designer's collection popular amongst Gen-Z, Alani responds with an astrological explanation: \"27 is the start of your Saturn return, so everything that feels bad right now is actually good.\" References to star signs, famous private schools in LA and internet celebrities might sound gibberish to those who didn't grow up in the area, in a certain zip code, or on social media, but that's the point:  I Love LA  doesn't just walk into traps around internet culture and the massive industry that has spawned from it    — it lays them out for you.  The 30-minute, episodic format of  I Love LA , Sennott's first credit as a creator, plays to the actor's comedic strengths of witty one-liners and creating characters that feel relatable. (The series also includes Sennott's directing debut.) Over the last few years, the NYU graduate has made a career from embodying Gen-Z and millennial cringe — from starring in Comedy Central miniseries  Ayo and Rachel are Single  to her breakthrough lead role in indie favorite  Shiva Baby  to 2023's  Bottoms  alongside Ayo Edebiri. In  I Love LA , there's a reason that despite each character's obvious flaws, most of which are driven by ego and insecurities, you still find yourself rooting for them. The show is shrouded in a self-awareness around the fact that, in LA, making popular 30-second videos on TikTok can get you cozy with A-listers. Buying into the glitz and the glam is part of the ridiculousness of a city dubbed \"la-la-land\" for a reason. It's a perspective that someone like Sennott is apt to bring as an LA outsider who grew up on the East Coast. I Love LA  is the culmination of Sennott's career thus far — a show for anyone who grew up \"chronically online\" and for whom \"making it\" means waking up and asking \"how did I get here?\" before putting on a mini-skirt and stilettos to meet with a micro-celebrity they pretend to like. \"Hustle until your idols become your rivals,\" Maia says to hype herself up in the mirror.

Gen Z and millennial Americans are feeling increasingly demoralized about their economic prospects, and some say their concerns have gone unaddressed by elected officials. In communities of all kinds, voters in their 20s and 30s are confronting a financial reality of rising costs, mounting debt and minimal wage growth. But how is this changing their political views? It's a question that NPR  put to readers . We received more than 1,100 submissions from across the political spectrum from almost every state in the U.S. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many described a similar reality — one where economic worries loom large over their everyday lives and erode their faith in the ability of those in power. Taken together, their responses paint a portrait of a generation of voters discouraged by what they see in Washington and who increasingly feel as if they have no political home. It is important to note that the responses are not from a representative sample of all young voters. But what readers shared helps highlight a steep challenge facing Democrats and Republicans alike as they work to win over these voters, who are collectively expected to make up  more than half the electorate in 2028 . Here is a snapshot of what readers shared.  These responses have been edited for clarity and length. Young voters are united in disappointment  Many young Americans feel a collective sense of disillusionment in the political system, and respondents told NPR that their financial struggles are exacerbating that pain. Recent polling seems to underscore the frustrations many shared with NPR. Just a fraction of young voters feel confident in government institutions, with less than 2 in 10 of those 18 to 29 years old saying they trust the federal government to do the right thing most or all of the time, according to the latest  Harvard Youth Poll , from this spring. Similarly, only 16% of those under 30 believe democracy is working well for them,  according to a report  from the young voter research organization, CIRCLE. Their life goals are on hold — for some indefinitely  Young people shared that one of the biggest drivers feeding into their sense of political frustration is the struggle to get ahead financially or even just stay afloat. When asked what economic success looks like for them, respondents didn't want lavish mansions or high-priced sports cars. Instead, their ambitions were more modest, often centering on the need for financial stability. Yet even that felt out of reach for many. Young Americans said goals like owning a home, starting a family or pursuing a dream job feel increasingly like a luxury rather than an achievable milestone. Financial concerns are forcing them to reframe what's possible and sometimes choose one goal over another. Financial roadblocks standing in the way  Many are navigating a unique economic moment where both median home and rental prices, for example, have  risen at a faster pace than wages  for roughly two decades. People are also waiting longer to buy homes. The median age of a first-time homebuyer in 2024 stood at 38, 10 years older than in the early 1990s,  according to the National Association of Realtors . Debt is also a barrier. Despite collectively making up the  largest share of the labor force  and being on track to surpass older generations in  educational attainment , Generation Z and millennials have  higher rates of student loan debt  and more  mortgage debt . Family planning looks different as well. People are deciding to have  fewer children  or not start a family. Last year, the U.S. fertility rate hit a  record low , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They watched their parents succeed, but struggle themselves In the face of financial challenges, respondents say they're struggling to reach or build upon the lifestyle achieved by their parents and grandparents, making some feel less hopeful about the future. Even with hard work and a degree, many readers said they have accomplished less than their parents had by the same age. This has led many to feel disillusioned with, even betrayed by, the very system that promised to set them up for success and stability. Despite losing faith in most politicians, populism resonates Young Americans see very few politicians actively addressing their concerns around affordability, leading some to lose faith in the effectiveness of either major political party. \"Over time, I've come to see our two-party system as two wings on the same bird,\" explained 27-year-old respondent Sophie Howard, from Davenport, Iowa. When asked which politicians are speaking to their concerns, liberal-leaning respondents frequently highlighted progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Zohran Mamdani, the Democrats' nominee for mayor in New York City. Readers on the conservative side often coalesced around President Trump and Vice President Vance. Many respondents returned to the same point: that they're most inspired by populist-style leaders who focus on disrupting the status quo. It's a message that young people say goes past political labels, pushing some to opposite poles on the ideological spectrum and leaving others feeling stuck in the middle. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5587657","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"In case 2025 wasn't scary enough, it was a great year for horror, too","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article celebrates the 2025 horror film season, highlighting several standout releases that explore a range of fears: from mass disappearances and animal empathy to racialized supernatural narratives, zombie evolution, and nuclear brinkmanship.

No tricks, just treats. Weapons  Available to stream on HBO Max and rent on demand.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Weapons  begins with something that seems impossible: One night, in the suburb of Maybrook, every student (save one) from Justine Gandy's third-grade classroom gets up at 2:17 a.m., goes downstairs, walks out of the house, and silently runs off into the night. They are gone, 17 of them. They are caught on doorbell cameras or security cameras, disappearing into the woods or just into the darkness. Suspicion falls on Justine (Julia Garner), for the simple reason that nobody can figure out how these kids could disappear unless something was happening in that classroom, on her watch. In large part, not unlike HBO's 2014 series  The Leftovers  and the novel that inspired it,  Weapons  is a story about a community recovering from an inexplicable trauma that arrives like a natural disaster, wreaks havoc, and then cannot be reversed, only survived. But there is another thing, another Whole Thing going on in this story, which I would not spoil for anything, because it is simply too wonderfully scary and strange.  – Linda Holmes Read the full review here.  Good Boy  In limited theaters; available to rent on demand.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       No harm befalls the deeply sympathetic canine protagonist of  Good Boy , a low-budget horror film   based on those eerie moments when pets seem to have a heightened sense of a presence humans can't detect. The dog in question, named Indy,  is the director's dog in real life , and we experience the events of the film through his soulful eyes. The film features indie horror auteur Larry Fessenden in a surprise supporting role, and in some ways, it belongs to his lineage of scary movies that explore humanity's rapacious relationship with nature. While some horror fans have expressed disappointment over  Good Boy's  deliberate pace and absence of jump scares, critics have celebrated the film's emotional, innovative storytelling from the point of view of a very good boy.  — Neda Ulaby  Sinners  Available to stream on HBO Max and rent on demand.  This trailer includes an instance of vulgar language.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       It's 1932 in Clarksdale, Miss., and enterprising twin brothers Smoke and Stack, both played by Coogler's longtime muse Michael B. Jordan, have returned to town after some years away in Chicago. What the siblings got into while up North in all likelihood wasn't on the up-and-up; think robbing, stealing, and doing business with Irish and Italian gangsters. But now back home, they're flush with cash and booze and eager to set up a new venture: a juke joint. It's possible you're aware that  Sinners  involves vampires, and it does. In a straightforward metaphor for all the ways Black culture has been co-opted by whiteness, the raucous pleasures and sonic beauty of the juke joint attract the interest of a trio of demons led by Remmick (Jack O'Connell); they wish to literally leech off of the talents and energy of Black folks. And — this is not a spoiler — some of those Black people make it pretty easy for Remmick and his ilk to taste blood.  – Aisha Harris  Read the full review here.  28 Years Later  Available to stream on Netflix and rent on demand.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The apocalyptic horror film  28 Years Later  takes place in the same world as the 2002 film  28 Days Later , where a deadly virus transformed the citizens of England into rabid, blood-spewing creatures with really impressive lung capacity. Seriously, those zombies were just as good at wind sprints as they were at cross-country. This year's film picks up almost three decades later on a small island connected to the mainland by a causeway, where a group of survivors eke out a modest existence. A desperate expedition to the mainland reveals new allies and new horrors — because the infected have evolved.  — Glen Weldon Listen to the Pop Culture Happy Hour panel discuss the movie . Presence Available to stream on Hulu and rent on demand.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       The haunted-house thriller  Presence  has a formal conceit so clever, I'm surprised it hasn't ever been done or attempted before. Maybe another movie  has  done it that I'm not aware of. This is a ghost story told entirely from the ghost's point of view: We see what the ghost sees. The ghost cannot leave the house, and so the movie never leaves the house, either. You could say that the ghost is played by the director,  Steven Soderbergh , who serves as his own cinematographer, as usual, working under the pseudonym of Peter Andrews. That's Soderbergh holding the camera as it glides up and down the stairs, following the characters from room to room, and hovering over them as they try to figure out what's going on.  Soderbergh's camera movements are so delicate and expressive, he can convey empathy with a mere twitch or shudder, or rage with a sudden, violent lurch. Before long, we realize that the ghost isn't trying to scare this family; it's trying to warn them. —  Justin Chang Read the full review here . Frankenstein  In theaters; on Netflix Nov. 7.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       Guillermo del Toro has made several monster movies of a particular bent — soulful, swoony, feverish films about grotesque-looking creatures who prove themselves more deeply human than the humans who reject them. Which is why  Frankenstein  seems like the perfect match between story and muse; certainly  del Toro's been talking about  making his own version of the tale for decades, calling it his \"lifelong dream.\" That dream is now realized, and while the resulting film captures the tone and spirit of the original novel in all its breathless zeal and hie-me-to-yon-fainting-couch deliriousness, the many narrative tweaks del Toro has made — some of which work, some of which don't — ensure that you'd never mistake his  Frankenstein  for anyone else's.  – Glen Weldon Read the full review here.  A House of Dynamite  Available in limited theaters and streaming on Netflix.  This trailer includes instances of vulgar language.  \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       An entirely plausible nuclear horror story from the Oscar-winning director of  The Hurt Locker , this nerve-jangling thriller begins with a ballistic missile headed toward the continental U.S. Origin unknown, but consequences cataclysmic, the missile plays into doomsday fears so primal, most of us bury them. Nuclear war is unthinkable, we tell ourselves, because mutually assured destruction means no government would ever start one. But suppose, as director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim have, that a seemingly rogue threat can't quickly be traced, that a missile will strike a major American city in just 19 minutes, and that fallible, increasingly frantic civilian and military leaders haven't a clue how to finesse the possible obliteration of humankind. This explosive scenario, played for farce in  Dr. Strangelove , leads here into white knuckle territory.  – Bob Mondello  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1199885895","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-15","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Supreme Court Ruling and New Data Protection Laws Shape Digital Privacy Discourse","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent decision by the Supreme Court in the case of Smith v.

Try smiling or doing a good deed to snap out of it \n         By Marielle Segarra, Margaret Cirino \n        \n           Updated Friday, January 3, 2025 • 4:09 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This story was originally published on Jan. 15, 2024, and has been updated.  When Jenny Taitz returned to work after giving birth to her second child, she started a bad habit. Out of anxiety, she chewed on her fingernail to the point that it got infected. And she needed emergency surgery to treat it.  If she had only paused for an emotional \"reset,\" or taken a moment to respond to her stress, she might have saved herself hours in the ER, says  Taitz, a clinical psychologist . \"Stress resets are quick ways to improve how you feel in minutes. They allow you to do things that will help you solve problems rather than make things so much worse for yourself.\"  That's the focus of Taitz's book,  Stress Resets: How to Soothe Your Body and Mind in Minutes . In it, she shares 75 science-backed techniques to help alleviate stress and anxiety in real time — \"no ponderous meditations, medications or martinis required,\" she writes.  Taitz interviewed experts and combed through the latest research to compile a comprehensive menu of resets for her book. She explains what to do if you have trouble focusing or breathing, feel stuck in a cycle of panic, or can't stop obsessing over a problem. Here are a few of our favorites.  Name that emotion Use when: You feel overwhelmed with negative emotions and you're not sure why you feel this way.  The technique:  Observe and describe the emotion passing through you and label its intensity. Maybe you're feeling dejected and you're at a 3 on a 0 to 5 scale. When you're able to observe your emotion, this can \"loosen the grip\" of your sadness, anger or stress and \"not be engulfed by them,\" says Taitz.  Researchers call this technique \" affect labeling .\" Taitz says it can disrupt the activity in your limbic system, the emotional part of the brain. It allows you to instead activate the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the more reasonable part of your brain, which reduces the intensity of your emotions.  Studies  have shown that when people viewed upsetting images and labeled their emotions, they experienced significantly less distress.  Make a pie chart of your life Use when: There's been an upsetting event and now you think everything is terrible — for example, you didn't get the job you really, really wanted.  The technique:  Grab a pen and paper and make a list of what you care most about: health, friendships, career, hobbies, family, pets. Assign each item a percentage based on how much it matters to you — then draw each segment in a pie chart.  The image should be an instant reminder that \"there are a lot of other things that matter\" in your life, says Taitz. So don't let the one thing that upsets you take up 100% of your thoughts.  The pie chart method is grounded in something called  psychological flexibility , says Taitz. This is the ability to adapt to changing surroundings smoothly. Exercises like this one can help you practice perspective.  Wear a half smile Use when: You're in a setting that is making you anxious, but you have to get through it — like when you're sitting in traffic, or about to give a big wedding speech.    The technique:  Do you tense up your face when you're stressed? If so, Taitz wants you to try a half smile.  Ever so slightly raise the upper corners of your lips. This will automatically reduce all that tension between your eyebrows and relax your face muscles, communicating to your brain that everything's OK, she says.  Taitz recommends wearing a half smile when you're in a strenuous or anxious setting. \"If you're sitting in a lot of traffic, clenching your hands on the steering wheel and tensing your face, that's not going to help you accept what is happening,\" says Taitz. \"But if you can soften your face, you're more likely to make peace\" with your situation. The half smile technique is rooted in what some researchers call the  facial feedback hypothesis , the theory that our faces influence our emotions. In one  3,800-person study  from 2022, people who changed their facial expressions to appear happier felt more positive emotions as a result.  The key is not to fake it, says Taitz. Focus on feeling tranquil both inside and out. Do a good deed Use when: You feel like you have no control over your life. Your apartment flooded, your date canceled, you lost your wallet – nothing seems to be going right! The technique:  Many of the reasons why we feel stressed \"are because we feel powerless. We're so focused on all the things going wrong,\" says Taitz.  Doing a good deed can remind you that you have the power and ability to make things better — for yourself and others. \"You can live by your values even if so much is out of your control,\" she says.  These kind acts don't have to be time-consuming, she adds. They can be small, positive actions that you can do in a pinch: Send a friend a greeting card out of the blue. Be extra kind to your neighbors. Find a volunteer opportunity that resonates with you and commit to it.  These acts may even offer positive benefits to your health. One  800-person study  of older adults found that those who did good deeds, like helping family members with errands or providing childcare, had a lower chance of dying from stress-related causes.  Taitz says all of these are actions like \"small wheels on a big suitcase.\" A tiny tool can help make a difference in carrying a huge load. So pause the next time you're feeling stressed and give yourself a reset. \"A moment of awareness and a strategy can make what feels overwhelming doable.\" The audio portion of this episode was produced by Margaret Cirino.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. Hey, everybody, it's Marielle. You ever just get completely overwhelmed? The phone is ringing nonstop. You've got dozens of unread emails just from today. Your kids are fighting over a toy. You open the mail, and you've got a huge, unexpected bill from the doctor's office. Oh, and you're hangry, so that doesn't help anything. The stress, you know, sometimes it just reaches a fever pitch that can feel terrible in our bodies. JENNY TAITZ: For some people it's very physical. SEGARRA: Jenny Taitz is a clinical psychologist, and she says stress also shows up in our thoughts and our behaviors. TAITZ: So if I'm feeling really angry, that usually includes some sort of judgment of that was really unfair. In my body, I may be feeling really tense and scowling, and my behavior may be to send an aggressive text or say something really rude or yell. SEGARRA: In these moments when we're overextended, it's hard to carve out a path forward. Jenny would like you to try something, though, called a stress reset. TAITZ: Stress resets are quick ways to improve how you feel in minutes, and that allows you, ultimately, to do things that will help you solve problems rather than make things so much worse for yourself. SEGARRA: Jenny wrote a book called \"Stress Resets: How To Soothe Your Body And Mind In Minutes.\" And on this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to give you a whole bunch of resets for your mind, your body and your behavior. You'll pick what works for you depending on what your stress feels like and how it's showing up. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Jenny, in the book, you outline different types of stress resets for your mind, for your body and for your behavior. How are these different? TAITZ: So mind resets specifically target thinking in ways that don't serve us. Body resets really target our physical experience of stress and behavior resets really are meant to improve our behavior so we don't act in ways that just makes stress skyrocket. SEGARRA: So how would you know that you might need a mind reset? TAITZ: When you are really, really stuck in overthinking, thinking the worst and lacking clear perspective, and you're thinking in ways that don't inch you closer to problem solving, but you feel like you're drowning in worst-case scenario thoughts. SEGARRA: Yeah. I've been there. I guess we all have. TAITZ: We all have. SEGARRA: OK. So let's walk through a few of the mind resets from the book. I'll tell you a few of my favorites. One was name that emotion. Tell me what that one is. TAITZ: Naming your emotion, just taking a step back and observing and describing your emotion to notice I am feeling sad and then labeling its intensity, maybe you're feeling sad at a three on a zero-to-five scale, loosens the grip of sadness because when you're able to observe your emotion, this allows us to not be engulfed by them but to see them with distance and openness. And naming them technically kind of disrupts activity in your limbic system, which is the emotional part of the brain, and allows you to engage your prefrontal cortex, which is the more reasonable part of your brain. So even if this sounds very simple, it actually, physiologically, makes a really profound difference. SEGARRA: I find that it helps, too, if I say, you know, what am I feeling, and then it might be, for instance, fear. Sometimes I'll journal this and then I'll be like, of what? And then it helps just to write down what I'm actually afraid of because sometimes looking at those things, I'm like, well, those are very unlikely to happen. Or if they do happen, I am able to handle that. TAITZ: I love that. And I also love simply thinking, like, if I'm feeling sad, it's pretty likely that I am a magnet for sad thoughts. And so rather than taking them very seriously, being really aware that my thinking is governed by sadness rather than the reality at hand. SEGARRA: Yeah. OK. Another one I really liked. Another mind reset is sing your thoughts. What is this one about? TAITZ: So singing your thoughts really gets at the concept of cognitive diffusion, which means playing with your thoughts rather than taking them so seriously. And one of the funnest ways to remember this is if you know that you have a recurrent thought that's simply not true and not helpful but something that's likely to come up when you're feeling emotions intensely. Let's say you're feeling lonely on a Saturday night, and your mind tends to berate you with the thought that I'm a loser, rather than, you know, telling yourself you're not or trying to convince yourself, really seeing that for what it is. It's just noise. To remember that if you did something like saying I'm a loser to the tune of \"Do You Believe In Magic\" or - one of my clients taught me this, and I think this is, like, the best way to apply this - is even just thinking what are thoughts, like, to the Haddaway song, \"What Is Love\" love can't hurt me no more, you know, what are thoughts? Thoughts can't hurt me no more. So if your thoughts are more like Play-Doh rather than cement, they can't hold you back in your life. SEGARRA: Yeah. I will say there's one that I find pops into my head - the repeating thought, like, nobody likes you. But it also sounds like just a - such a silly thing to sing. Like, I was just listening to \"Build Me Up Buttercup,\" you know, so maybe something like that. Like, (singing) why does everyone, everyone hate me so much? (Laughter). TAITZ: That's perfect because now you're - you can't sing that without laughing. So that automatically puts your inner wisdom in the front seat and your irrational thoughts where they belong. SEGARRA: OK. TAITZ: Yeah. That's such a powerful way for people to realize if this is working or not. If you have a sense of humor rather than a sense of defeat, then that's a good clue that you're on the right track. And this is not for thoughts like I need to get my work done. This is for thoughts that are downright unhelpful and ridiculous. SEGARRA: OK. All right. So the other mind reset that I really liked was make a pie chart of your life. Can you explain this one? TAITZ: Yes. So making a pie chart is really a way to remember all of the things that matter to us. And so if we take a step back and we write down with a pen and paper all of the various domains of our lives that matter - let's say our health, our career, our friendships, our hobbies - and then visually representing them so their relative weight is aligned with how much they matter, so maybe health is, like, 30% and hobbies is 20% or, you know, you need to really do some soul searching and come up with the numbers that represent what's truest for you. And making a pie chart of our lives is such a essential way to gain perspective when something disappointing happens because it's so easy if you're doing something like interviewing for a job you really want to think that everything is terrible if you don't get that role. And of course, it's a huge disappointment, and I don't want to minimize that at all. But I also want people to realize that even if something feels like it's everything, there are a lot of other things that matter. SEGARRA: You say it's kind of like zooming out to see the full picture. TAITZ: Exactly. SEGARRA: Got it. OK. Let's talk about body resets. When would you know that you might need one of these? TAITZ: If you are feeling really physically stressed - if you're really tense, if your shoulders are up to your ears, if you're finding that you're short of breath, if you feel really distracted by your body, like you can't sit at your desk because you feel so restless or overwhelmed, physically. SEGARRA: OK. All right. So one is move your body in short, quick bursts. What might that look like? TAITZ: If you're feeling very revved up, a lot of times, people just use that as evidence that something's really wrong. And so if you, instead, do something like do some jumping jacks, and then you can attribute your physical symptoms of stress to the exercise you're doing rather than something that you're catastrophizing and feeling afraid of. SEGARRA: Another one is expand your gaze. And I have to say, I tried this the other day when I was feeling really stressed out, and I was out to lunch but thinking about and overthinking about something, and this really worked. Can you talk about what it means, expand your gaze? TAITZ: I'm so happy this really worked for you. Yeah. A lot of times, as part of our stress response, we hyperfocus or we zoom in on what it is we're stressed about. And so simply zooming out to adopt a more relaxed view. So you might notice three sights. Maybe you notice three sounds. Because when we're stressed, our pupils tend to dilate and we narrow our attention. This is part of our fight-or-flight response. But when we literally relax our gaze, it's a little easier to just realize that there's so much more than the narrow focus of our stress. SEGARRA: Yeah. I was sitting at a restaurant, the weather was still nice enough that I could be sitting outside, actually, and I had been looking at my phone, but I just put it down and put it in my bag. And then I picked my head up and I looked at what was happening across the street. I looked at somebody walking their dog. I looked at, like, a bookstore. Just different things like that. Literally, like, zooming out the camera lens in my own eyeball, you know? TAITZ: And I love that because that allows you to naturally experience gratitude. A lot of people feel like gratitude is something being forced upon them that feels fake. But when we just look a little wider and bigger, there are so many things within our periphery that allow us to genuinely experience thanks and awareness. SEGARRA: Yeah. All right, one more body reset - sigh it out. Now, let's talk about this one because I do find that this helps. But also, if you're around other people and you're deep sighing, it can make them feel a little bit uncomfortable or anxious. TAITZ: Yeah. And, Marielle, this is the reason that there's 75 options in here, because different things really work for different people. But to do this, you gently close your lips, and you inhale through your nose, then take another inhale through your nose. So - and then an extended exhale. And this is called the physiological sigh. And repeating it a couple of times is known as cyclic sighing. And researchers have found that people practicing this for five minutes a day experienced more positive emotions. And when you intentionally sigh, your lungs expand and so you release more carbon dioxide. And a lot of carbon dioxide is associated with anxiety. And so by practicing this, you can kind of reset your breathing pattern, feel a little bit more relaxed and then doing this can kind of lend itself to slowing down your breathing in general. SEGARRA: I get it. So it sounds like this is a very particular kind of breathing practice. It's not just like all right everybody, deep sigh, like, ah, you know what I mean? Like, I come from a family of deep sighers is what I'm saying. And it is often used as a tool to indicate frustration to one's family members. But this sounds like a different thing where it's kind of a private moment, and you're just inhaling through your nose and then inhaling again a little bit and then exhaling long. TAITZ: Yeah. And it doesn't need to be a grunt. I could do it right now, you know, two back-to-back inhales and a longer exhale. And that may just seem like I'm almost, like, recalibrating. SEGARRA: It does work. All right. So our last category is behavior resets. How might you know that you need one of these? TAITZ: When you are acting in ways that are almost, like, the equivalent of a high-interest credit card, where short term, you might be feeling pretty good, but long term, your behaviors are going to come back to haunt you. So oftentimes, stress isn't just a feeling but also a behavior. And it might be helpful to just take a step back and think about what are your go-to stress behaviors that you want to improve. Is it being mean to the people around you? Is it canceling plans that you actually would enjoy because you want to curl up in bed? And so the first step would be to get really clear on what you tend to do when you get stressed and know that there are a lot of ways to make this moment better that don't - aren't going to hurt us long term. SEGARRA: OK. So some examples from the book are, for instance, to build a hope kit. What would that look like? TAITZ: If you're focusing on the negative, it's really helpful to have a way to quickly lean into hope. And hope isn't just a feeling, but it's a behavior. And creating a collection of objects, pictures, other sorts of mementos that remind you of things being better can help keep you going. And if you're someone that has a really good friend group and you could look at a picture of some close friends, or if music has always been a really powerful mood boost for you, having a playlist that you go to. Remarkably, there's an app called the Virtual Hope Box app, and people that struggle with suicidal feelings who use the Virtual Hope Box app actually have a reduction in feelings of wanting to die. And again, reminding ourselves in our hardest moments that we can continue forward and things will get better and have been better is such a gift to ourselves rather than predicting and rehearsing all of the ways things will continue to be terrible. SEGARRA: Yeah. For me, it's often pictures of my family and friends and my friends' kids and dogs and, like, I'll just pull them out and look at them. Like, there's even one recent picture of my friend's daughter eating a marshmallow, and her cheeks looks so big and it's just, like, the cutest squishiest picture ever. She's a year old. Like, I've been looking at it recently when I have felt down. TAITZ: I love that. Pictures are so powerful. Like, pictures actually can reduce our experience of pain. Like, looking at uplifting pictures or pictures of people that we love. I personally love music, and I love greeting, like, cards that people have written me that I can keep handy. SEGARRA: Yeah. That's really lovely. OK. Another behavior reset is to do a good deed. What might you do? What are some examples? TAITZ: There are so many ways to do good deeds. It could be something big. It could be something small. Even just noticing someone that might not normally be noticed. Sending someone a card just out of the blue is a really sweet gesture. Then, if you want to really commit to this, even finding a volunteer opportunity could make a really big difference. And this is such a nice way to feel like you have a say in your life. A lot of the reasons that we feel stressed is because we feel powerless or we're so focused on all of the things that are going wrong, and doing something nice is a way to actually feel like you have some ability to make things better and also gives you a little bit of perspective and helps you feel like you can live by your values, even if so much is out of your control. SEGARRA: Yeah. OK. What about take one step forward? I liked this one a lot. TAITZ: Taking one step forward is about doing the thing that we can do. And so rather than feeling overwhelmed, really picking one thing that you want to try to do to move closer to your goals. And so rather than making things feel really overwhelming by being too ambitious, just being really clear on the one thing that you can do that will be realistic and within reach. And it was really amazing, Marielle, for this book, I interviewed someone named John Moynihan, who is a police officer who was really seriously injured. He was shot while working, and he was actually shot in the face. It was a very horrific injury that - and a long recovery. And I asked him how he went from being in critical care to returning to his life in so many ways. And he really walked me through. He just - he set one goal at a time. And his first goal, starting when he was in the hospital, was doing this run that he did every summer since childhood. It was a seven-mile run in Cape Cod, and that was just his goal. It wasn't how am I going to figure the rest of my life out, how am I going to fully recover, it was like, how do I, like, learn how to walk again so I could complete this run somehow, even if I'm walking it? And setting that one goal created a positive cycle where other positive, forward movement came as a result. SEGARRA: Yeah. And even that goal, I imagine, started with something even smaller, right? He probably had to go to physical therapy. So it was like make appointment with physical therapist. And that's today's task, you know, or, like, do my exercises today. TAITZ: Yeah. 'Cause it's so easy for us also to then think about the next thing. But if it's even, you know, call the physical therapist and stand up for one moment and really celebrating that rather than feeling less than for not having finished everything in its entirety. SEGARRA: OK. So these are all really helpful resets that can help us in the moment when we're feeling overwhelmed by stress. I wonder, what's the work after those moments, right? What can we do to kind of improve or change our lives so that maybe we're not experiencing as much stress? TAITZ: For most of us, mental health is really a series of behaviors, and a lot of us underestimate that our habits can be as powerful as antidepressants. And so rather than waiting to be in a really tough situation and trying to get yourself out of it, there are things we can do in advance. You know, getting a good night's sleep is a huge way to relieve stress. Exercising every day is a really powerful antidepressant. Connecting with people on a regular basis is such a powerful tool that even reduces the risk of getting a cold. And so rather than just leaning on quick things in difficult moments, we also want to set ourselves up to feel like our day-to-day life is more enjoyable and more livable and setting us up for success. And so I don't want anyone to feel like the goal of life is to build a hope kit or to sing your thoughts, but doing those things will allow us to unhook from the things that are holding us back and inch towards the things that we want our lives to stand for. SEGARRA: Wow. I feel like I could talk to you about this for days. Thank you so much. These are really helpful, Jenny. TAITZ: Thank you so much. I really appreciate your time. I want everyone to really realize that a little can go such a long way. It's like small wheels on a big suitcase. A moment of awareness and a doable strategy can make what feels overwhelming really doable. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: All right, time for a recap. If your mind is feeling all squirrely, try a mind reset. Name an emotion. Sing your thoughts. Make a pie chart of what's important in your life. Or maybe you're feeling like you need a body reset. Try moving your body, relaxing your gaze or doing some cyclic sighing. Or if you've been acting out a little bit, maybe you try a behavior reset. Put together a collection of objects that make you hopeful, do a good deed or just take one step forward towards a goal. Now, these resets aren't everything you need to know about mental health, but they will give you some space to figure out what you need and what changes you'd like to make in your life.

But for me and my friends, who are mostly women in our early 20s, it can also be scary.  Most of us have been catcalled on the street while walking home, grabbed at while moving through a crowd or pressured into having another drink or staying out later than we'd like. Because of concerns like these, it can be hard to enjoy going out. In fact, studies have shown that popular nightlife destinations like bars and clubs aren't the safest places to hang — especially for women and girls. According to  a 2017 study  published in the journal  Violence Against Women , this group frequently experiences unwanted sexual touching and persistent advances in these settings.  The burden shouldn't be on people like me, my friends and others in marginalized communities to protect ourselves — but depending on who you are and what you've experienced, you might feel like you don't have much of a choice. So what can we do to have a safer time out?  I reached out to health and safety educator  Karen Hughes  at the University of California, Berkeley, and Michelle and Zelda Gay, a mother-daughter duo who runs the personal safety group  Self-Offense , for advice. They say there are practical ways for people to reclaim control and minimize harm in these environments. And it starts with thinking about your well-being and security before you even step out of the house.  Here are their top three tips, which they say are helpful not just for marginalized folks, but for everyone.  Create a safety plan before the night begins For most people, the goal when going out is to have a nice time and prevent negative experiences, says Hughes. So take a moment to think about how to do that.   Reflect on previous nights out. What strategies helped you feel safe? Maybe you asked your bestie to join you on an outing with new friends. Or perhaps you took a taxi home late at night instead of waiting for the bus.   What did you regret the next day? If you went out with someone who ditched you minutes after getting to the venue, for example, you might consider not going out with her again — or inviting a trusted friend to tag along.  If you are planning on drinking or using drugs, Hughes says, ask yourself: what is your limit? Make sure you're sober enough to be aware of your surroundings and safety risks at all times. And if you're not partaking in these activities, that's totally OK — you can enjoy a night out sober, so ignore people who might try to tell you otherwise.  After considering these questions, create a personal safety plan, says Hughes. Do it before the night begins when you have a clear mind. And make your plan as specific as possible. You might say to yourself: \"Tonight, I am going to take a taxi home before midnight. I am not going to have more than two cocktails. And I will not go out alone with that friend who ditched me if she asks to hang out again.\"   It can be hard to stay true to these commitments, says Hughes, especially if friends beg you to stay out longer or have more drinks than you planned for. But try to find practical and creative ways to follow through. Make it convenient to stick to your curfew, for instance, by scheduling a ride share home in advance. Or make plans early the next morning as an extra incentive to go home at a reasonable hour.  \"Respect your earlier, more mindful self,\" says Hughes, and \"remember there was a reason [why you made those choices].\" Communicate confidence with your body language You might have seen those viral self-defense videos on TikTok, where people demonstrate how to escape choke holds or explain how to free your hands if they're bound by zip ties. Zelda and Michelle, who teach workshops on safety, sexual harassment and conflict de-esclation, say these strategies may not be helpful in a real-life scenario. If you're not comfortable with the maneuvers and haven't practiced them enough, they add, you may find yourself freezing up in the moment and putting yourself in harm's way.  An alternative approach to staying safe, say Zelda and Michelle, is to communicate alertness and confidence with your body language.  First, pay attention to your surroundings. When walking home alone late at night, your instinct might be to avoid making eye contact with passersby. But Zelda and Michelle say that can make you look like an easy target for harassment because you don't seem to be aware of your environment.  Instead, they say, actively look around and occasionally behind you. Is there anything that is making you feel nervous or unsafe? If something bad happens, are there any potential allies nearby who might be able to jump in and help? Michelle says making brief eye contact with passersby can communicate confidence and potentially deter someone who might otherwise try to bother you. Another tip is to project an air of self-assurance, say Zelda and Michelle. If you're waiting at a bus stop, for example, don't slouch over your phone — stand straight and be vigilant of your situation. When you're walking, look as though you have a clear destination in mind. If you don't know where you're going — let's say you're looking for your venue or your ride share pickup — focus on a fixed point ahead and walk toward it with purpose. These moves, says Zelda, \"read as confident,\" and can make people think twice before approaching or harassing you.  Learn how to say 'no' effectively If someone is harassing you in public, say, catcalling you on the street, you might want to turn around and tell them off. But sometimes, the safest course of action is to walk away, says Michelle. When people feel humiliated or shamed in public, she adds, they can get more aggressive — and the situation could further escalate and put you in a dangerous position. If you can't walk away — maybe a person has cornered you at a bar and is repeatedly asking to buy you a drink — Michelle suggests a kind but persistent \"no, but thank you,\" to communicate your message as clearly as possible and avoid a potentially aggressive outburst.  You can also help avoid this situation by trying a non-verbal tactic. Hughes says to hold a drink in your hand — even if it's a Shirley Temple or a diet Pepsi — to signal that you are not in need of a drink because you already have one.  And remember, says Zelda: our relationship to \"no\" has a lot to do with our gender. Men are often encouraged to be persistent and aggressive to get what they want. And women are conditioned to acquiesce and get along with everyone. That dynamic — especially in an environment where people are drinking and can be more uninhibited or vulnerable — is a recipe for disaster. Learning to say and respect \"no\" is an important practice to communicate your boundaries on a night out.  The audio portion of this episode was produced by Audrey Nguyen.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MICHELLE ASLAM, HOST:   Just a heads up - this episode contains discussion about sexual harassment and assault. I moved to a new city recently, and I've been super lucky to find a great group of friends here. We hit it off almost immediately, and we've been getting together almost every weekend since. There's a lot to do in the city at night - restaurants, bars, music events, comedy clubs, bowling. We were having a conversation over dinner recently, coming up with new places we could go, fun activities to try. A conversation that should have been light and fun got kind of intense. We ended up talking about all of these bad experiences we've had with nightlife - getting harassed on the bus at night, someone getting handsy in a crowd, friends that pressure you into situations that you're uncomfortable with, even assault. Everyone had a different story, and if it wasn't something that happened to them, it's something that they witnessed or that happened to a friend. I started thinking about how hard it can be to enjoy your night when you're carrying around all of these very real and legitimate anxieties about keeping you and your friends safe at the same time. It's not fair, and the burden shouldn't lie on you to keep yourself safe. But depending on who you are and what you've experienced, you might not feel like you have much of a choice. ZELDA GAY: There are folks who live like they are under attack at all times. And that's valid, especially for folks who are in marginalized communities 'cause there is statistical evidence that someone is trying to harm you. ASLAM: I'm Michelle Aslam, a producer for LIFE KIT. This episode is not going to prevent you from running into trouble. And it's not an exhaustive resource on safety. Instead, we're turning to the experts for some tips and strategies to reclaim some control over your night out, whatever you want it to look like. Think of it like a pregame. Z GAY: There's pregaming with booze. And then there's pregaming with safety. ASLAM: Stick around. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ASLAM: Let's jump right into takeaway one. Before you head out the door, have a game plan. I'm sure you're eager to get out there, but you want to think things through before you commit, or you might find yourself in an unexpected situation. So first, take a minute to check in with yourself. KAREN HUGHES: Take the time to reflect on previous experiences. What worked? What didn't work? What do you want to find out more about before you get ready to go out tonight? Most importantly, what do you want to get out of this experience? Socially, emotionally, physically, what do you and don't you want to get out of it? ASLAM: Karen Hughes is a health educator at UC Berkeley. She put together a collection of tips and strategies for her students over the years that takes a harm reduction approach to safety. HUGHES: So harm reduction is really about getting what you want out of any experience without what you don't want out of any experience. So you can - and many of us do - take a harm reduction approach to life in general. ASLAM: So that means she's not going to spend time lecturing you about the right or wrong way to have fun. That's your decision and not what this episode is about. Instead, her advice focuses on how to keep everyone safe. And that starts with some introspection. Once you have some clarity about what you want to do, draw some lines in the sand for yourself. Are you committed to staying sober tonight? If so, are you comfortable being around drugs or alcohol? If you are planning on using or drinking, how much is too much for you? In the heat of the moment, it can be easy to brush off commitments you made before the night started, so think of ways to hold yourself to them. For example, if you want to be home by a certain time, Karen says it might be a good idea to schedule your ride home before you even head out. HUGHES: It might be hard at that moment that evening to realize it's the time that you had pre-set to exit, but respect your earlier self, respect your mindful self. There was a reason. And go with it. ASLAM: Next, make sure everyone in the group is on the same page. This can also be a good way to learn what everyone is looking for tonight and stick to a mutually agreed on plan. Ask your friends, how is everyone getting home at the end of the night? What happens if someone in the group wants to stay behind by themselves? Or what if someone's drunk and wants to go home with a stranger? If plans aren't lining up with what you've decided that you want for yourself, it's OK to sit this one out. FOMO is a real thing, but a night out turning into a nightmare is also a very real possibility. And then there are the basics. So charge your phone and consider bringing a charger along with you. Drink lots of water. And maybe swap emergency contact info. It can be helpful to have a roommate's phone number in case you have to check in to make sure your friend made it home safe at the end of the night. Next, getting safely to your destination. Whether you're going out to meet a hinge match for a nice dinner date, going to a concert or planning on a night of dancing with the girlies, there's a lot that can go through your head when you're walking around at night, especially if you're alone. We've all seen the TikToks with the complicated self-defense choreography, videos about how to get out of zip ties or escape a choke hold. And while holding your keys between your fingers like a weapon might make you feel like you have some power over a scary situation, for most of us, none of that is going to do much in a real scenario for a lot of reasons. Z GAY: Many people - when we imagine self-defense, it's like we freeze. MICHELLE GAY: Where the real progress is going to be made is in that space that precedes an attack. ASLAM: That was Michelle and Zelda Gay. They're a mother-daughter duo who teach workshops on personal safety. But they're not here to tell you how to fight your way out of trouble, because let's be honest - most of us are probably not going to karate chop our way out of being harassed in the middle of a street. Here's Zelda again. Z GAY: The other thing we want to say is like, we do not want you walking around in life like you're in a personal protection workshop. Like, that is exhausting. Either people are on hyper alert, like, I need - I can't trust anyone, or there's this kind of false confidence of, like, I know what bad people look like. I know what bad situations look like. ASLAM: Instead of self-defense, Michelle and Zelda focus on teaching us ways to avoid that kind of conflict with verbal and nonverbal communication. They call this approach to safety Self Offense. It's also the name of their organization. Z GAY: It's not rules to follow. It's not the truth about safety. It's not the truth about protecting yourself. We don't have answers. We do have some very useful practices. Life is going to go down how life is going to go down. And I have the ability to own that without shame or blame and even to potentially recontextualize that so that you have power - that's self-offense. That's the game. ASLAM: So what can you do to make yourself feel a little bit less vulnerable as you get to your destination? That's takeaway two - practice self-offense and communicate confidence. It's not enough to prevent you from becoming a target, but Michelle and Zelda say projecting confidence and alertness can make a big difference. Z GAY: Communicate awareness, like, that you are actively paying attention and to also communicate that you know where you're going, which we say reads as confident - and that if you look confident and you look like you know where you're going, that you don't read as much as a target. ASLAM: So whipping out your phone while you're walking or looking down at the sidewalk to avoid eye contact might not be the best idea. I'll admit I'm guilty of this, too. Instead, Zelda and Michelle recommend the self-offense walk. Z GAY: So we say that you pick a point, and you move directly towards that point. Now, you know, you might not know where you're going, but you can see from here to the garbage cans. You're going to walk to the garbage can like you know where you're going. And then you're going to actively turn your head to look around you so that you appear obviously alert. And this includes looking behind you. ASLAM: So walk like you know where you're going. Pay attention to your environment. Look around and make eye contact. I know this probably sounds like a lot to think about when you're just trying to find the venue. But the idea is that you put this into practice. And eventually, it just becomes a habit, a way of confidently moving through the world that just comes naturally to you, even in situations where you feel more vulnerable. Z GAY: So we recommend that you practice looking behind you in broad daylight when you're not afraid because like, it's a profound and valid fear when you're walking down the street, and it's dark to look behind you. Like, we do not want to, like, oh yeah, just look behind you. Like, no, it - like, when you're dealing with that really real concern, you'll want some muscle. ASLAM: Muscle that you build through practice. If you do find yourself in a situation in the middle of the street, maybe someone screaming at you or approaching you when you just want to be left alone, Zelda says it's important to evaluate the situation. Ask yourself, what exactly is the danger here? Z GAY: While the experience is very upsetting, even alarming, we want you to ask questions like, how close is this person to me? Do they appear to be escalating? Like, do they appear to be getting more and more agitated or more and more angry? Are they carrying anything of any kind that could be used as a weapon? ASLAM: Sometimes, putting distance between you and the other person is the simplest solution. But on public transportation, that can be kind of hard to do. Michelle has some advice that comes from personal experience. M GAY: The subway was super crowded, and I sat beside this guy. I could tell he was maybe a little bit high or drunk. And he looked at me, and he said, yo, baby. He said, I got somebody at home. But if you want to come with me, I'll call her and tell her I'm going to be late. And he said it loud, and people were watching me. And I had this opportunity where I could just be like, ew. Or what are you, nuts? Or, like, totally, like - would you call it dragging him? And instead, I said, oh, that's just so sweet. Thank you so much, but I'm going to pass on that. But, like, just to make it light, I don't really want to embarrass or belittle somebody when given the opportunity. ASLAM: This isn't just about being polite. If you're pissed and feeling like telling them off, you have every right to. But consider that when people feel embarrassed or humiliated in public, they can get more aggressive, and the situation could start to escalate. So that's public transit. If rideshare makes you feel vulnerable, too, that's completely valid. You're in someone else's car, and they have total control over where you're going. Familiarize yourself with the safety features that come with those apps. Some let you message your trip to a friend so they can follow along and make sure that you get to your destination. Others have numbers that you can call in case of an emergency. And here are some basic tips. Confirm your driver's license plate matches the info that you have before you get in the car. When they arrive, ask them who the ride is for. You can even screenshot your ride's info and send it to your friends when you're on your way so they have an idea of when to expect you. You can call a friend during the trip, but make sure you're paying attention to the ride and heading in the right direction. And whether you're walking, taking the bus, driving or taking rideshare, sharing your locations with your friends along with an on-my-way text is a good way to let your friends know to keep an eye out. OK. So you've made it to your destination safe and sound. If you've got a game plan, you're walking into this with a good idea of what you want to participate in and what your boundaries are, so stick to it. If I'm starting to make the game plan sound like a legally binding document, I want to make it clear that it's not. Obviously, things can still change in the moment, but you want to think hard about why you're changing your mind. HUGHES: I know it feels hard sometimes. I love spontaneity as much as anybody does. But maybe this is not the time and place to be spontaneous and make a quick decision that wasn't in your plan. ASLAM: A lot of the time, we can get pushed into making choices we wouldn't usually make because of social pressure. We've all heard about the dangers of peer pressure before, but this isn't something that only teenagers struggle with. And, sometimes, it can come from friends who have the best intentions. So that's takeaway three. Stick to your boundaries and respect other people's boundaries. When you don't want to do something, say so. And if someone else makes their boundaries clear to you, respect that. It can be awkward to turn something or someone down, but clear communication and mutual respect is key. If you're not planning on drinking or you're done for the night, here's one tip Karen gives her students. HUGHES: Having a cup in your hand seems that - a cue for people who are using when they see someone who doesn't appear to be using. I guess it makes them uncomfortable. But if you have a cup in your hand, you can help avoid that. So you can put whatever you want in that cup. ASLAM: Trust me, I order my fair share of Shirley Temples and mocktails. This works. But there's also just a good old-fashioned, no thanks. I'm good. And side note, if you're the one throwing the party, there are things you can do to help make sure folks are safe, too. HUGHES: In fact, party throwers have so much opportunity and responsibility for creating spaces in which everybody can get what they want without what they don't want. ASLAM: If you're providing mixed drinks, make sure guests know exactly what's in it. Put up a sign detailing exactly what's in the drink. Also, think twice about a self-serve type of setup to minimize the chance that someone can add something to the drinks that shouldn't be in there. Having a designated bartender can also help you keep an eye out on folks who look like they're hitting their limit. And if you decide to drink or use yourself, know what you're putting in your body. Remember to watch your drink and pay attention to the way you're feeling. Karen says that if you feel like you're not alert enough to be aware of your surroundings, you probably want to stop or slow down so you're not putting yourself at risk in any way. Now let's talk about socializing and flirting. Here's an example from an experience that Zelda had. Z GAY: I was in a bar, and I was with these girls in Seattle. And this guy just kept asking to buy us drinks. And the girls were like, oh, OK, well - like, you could tell that they were - they didn't know how to say no directly, or they weren't empowered to say no directly. And so they just kind of kept dancing around it. And he kept asking. He kept persisting. And so I turned to him, and I was like, you know what, man? Thank you so much. But I think we're good. And it was like, he turned on me. He was like, oh. ASLAM: Unfortunately, this happens a lot. People who can't figure out how to say no when someone offers to buy them a drink or get their number and then the people who just refuse to hear it or push right past it. Z GAY: We have all this cultural conditioning around no, and then we wonder why it's so freaking muddy, and none of us know how to communicate effectively or listen effectively. ASLAM: If you're like me, you might find yourself dancing around no because you don't want to be rude or make anyone feel bad. Or maybe you're someone who hears, I don't want to do that, and thinks, I can change your mind. Z GAY: A lot of cisgendered men are conditioned to push past no. It's a part of, like, in the same way that a lot of cisgendered women - we're supposed to smooth things out. We're supposed to get along. We're supposed to make everybody feel good. So then you have this dynamic of folks who are taught to persist and folks who are taught to acquiesce. And then, of course, we have all this miscommunication and upset in the realm of boundaries. ASLAM: Zelda says it's important to consider what your relationship to no is and why. Z GAY: We really want you to look from, like, OK, I'm just going to try on that maybe there are some interactions that I'm not very good at hearing no, either. And I'm going to start to get interested in those. ASLAM: It's hard to look at yourself and see ways that you might be hurting other people, but this isn't just about making people a little uncomfortable. You have to learn to respect people's boundaries and really listen to what people are trying to tell you, or you might be crossing some serious lines. Sexual assault is a huge problem and could be a very real consequence if you ignore someone's no. And look. Consent can be surprisingly difficult to talk about and to navigate, which is why we've got a whole 'nother episode dedicated to it. But back to setting boundaries during a night out. If you're having trouble communicating no, try practicing what Michelle mentioned earlier. A kind but firm and persistent no, but thank you. And if you're trying that, but the other person just does not seem to be backing off... Z GAY: You might want to start to be like, I'm going to put a little bit of distance in between me and this person. ASLAM: And if you need an excuse to get away, you could try, thanks, but I've got to go meet up with some friends now. At the end of the day, trust your gut. If things feel more serious than that and you feel like your safety is at risk... M GAY: Then you want to maintain the distance. So you're going to have to probably back up and then definitely look to see, where are the exit? Who else is around? Who's paying attention to what's happening? Who's your potential ally? Is there somebody who looks like they can, you know, be a support to you? ASLAM: In an emergency situation, you want to let a bartender or another staff member know what's going on. A lot of places have phone numbers and codes posted in signs on the bathroom so you can get help or have someone escort you safely out of the venue. Here's something to keep in mind. You also want to be a good ally. So really listen to what people are trying to say. Even for the small things, back off when someone isn't interested and step in if you notice that someone's being pushed into something. That brings us to takeaway four. Watch out for your friends. If you came with a group, you want to stick together if possible. When someone leaves the group to go mingle or get a drink or use the bathroom, you want to make sure you keep an eye on them. And if you notice that one of your friends has been gone for too long or that they're having a hard time getting out of a situation, they might need some rescuing. Z GAY: Hey, do you really want to say no, and you're just having some trouble? Like, what's going on? ASLAM: And remember, you came with a plan. And if they say they want to leave with a stranger or stay behind, remind them about your earlier conversation. You may have to really put your foot down. They might hate you for it now, but you've got to have faith that they'll appreciate you for stepping in later. Watching out for your friends also means cutting them off when they've had too much. But it can be hard to know when they've gone too far and what exactly you're supposed to do about it. Karen says it can be helpful to think of intervention on a scale. HUGHES: The earliest signs of intoxication you can recognize are slurring and swaying. And at that point, you want to slow the person down. So offer them food. Offer them water. Distract them. The next level up on our scale is if you see somebody who's stumbling, rambling, vomiting, we say that's time to cut them off. And you got to trust your gut. ASLAM: At that point, it's probably best to get them home. Again, it's not fun to fight your friends when they're drunk. But if you don't step in, the consequences can be pretty scary. Here's when Karen says it's time to call for help. HUGHES: So we created the acronym CUSP - C-U-S-P. C is for cold skin. U is for for unresponsive. S is for slow breathing. And P is for puking repeatedly. ASLAM: Calling for medical attention can be a traumatizing experience for everybody involved. Depending on where you are, there may be laws to help protect you against consequences for participating in prohibited activities like underage drinking or using illegal drugs if you're calling for help. They're called medical amnesty laws. You can look them up by state. And if you're a student, familiarize yourself with your campus's safety policies. But listen. Either way, you really don't want it to go that far. So when you notice that things are starting to get out of control, intervene early. The goal is to have a good time and get everyone home safely. That brings us to takeaway number five, check in at the end of the night and reflect. Once everyone is home safely, take a beat to debrief. If you're too exhausted, maybe talk things out over breakfast the next morning. HUGHES: Later on, when you're reflecting back on your whole experience, you can decide, did that work the way I wanted it to? Would I do it a little differently the next time? ASLAM: Sometimes, our bad experiences were out of our control. And that's OK. But for the things that you can control, consider what needs to change so that you can have a better experience moving forward. And to recap, takeaway one, before you head out the door, have a game plan. Know your motivations, your boundaries and your limits. Takeaway number two, practice self-offense and communicate confidence. These strategies don't just come to you when you need them. It's a muscle that you build with practice in your daily life. Takeaway three, stick to your boundaries and respect other people's boundaries. Learn to communicate and listen to no effectively. Takeaway number four, watch out for your friends and keep an eye on everyone. Step in when you need to for their safety. Takeaway number five, check in and reflect so that things go better for everyone the next time. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ASLAM: For more LIFE KIT, check out her other episodes.

definitely about alienation \n         By Glen Weldon \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 6:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         As the end credits began to scroll at my screening of  Bugonia , the audience sat silently in the darkness for several long seconds. Director Yorgos Lanthimos' latest film follows Teddy (Jesse Plemons), a grimy, raw-boned conspiracy theorist who, alongside his cousin Don (Aidan Delbis), kidnaps Michelle (Emma Stone) a steely Big Pharma CEO, because he's convinced himself she's an alien. It's not uncommon for a movie to lull a theater full of people into a moment of collective contemplation, of course. Such silences take various forms, depending on the film that precedes them: stunned, or thoughtful, or weighted with emotion. But  Bugonia  is a Lanthimos film. Which explains why, at its conclusion, the audience decided to take a moment to sit with it, before a lone voice pierced the gloom: \"The f***,\" it shouted, \"was  that ?\" Reader, I grinned. For those of us who count ourselves firmly in the tank for Lanthimos as a filmmaker, that cry of hapless, outraged bumfuzzlement is one reason we love seeing his stuff with a crowd. Because if it's true that art comforts the disturbed and disturbs the comfortable, the occasional plaintive cry of disturbed confusion can make the moviegoing experience that much richer and more enjoyable. Keep your Milk Duds — gimme a fellow theatergoer's indignation, in a bucket, with extra butter. Many of Lanthimos' previous films evoked similar responses, as he does tend to traffic in all things bleak and despondent. It's just who he is: What Spielberg is to childlike wonder, Lanthimos is to the abject misery of the human condition. And while he has made films that received widespread audience and critical acclaim, his core sensibility is not engineered for mainstream success, and some of us love him all the more for that. So you go into a Lanthimos film expecting some pushback from folks who just want to sit back and have a good time at the movies. But this time? That guy who shouted at my screening of  Bugonia ? He's got a point. Doing the Lanthi-most Because as enjoyable as I found the film (until its final three minutes and 37 seconds, about which more later), it only manages to qualify as mid-tier Lanthimos, chiefly because it doesn't register as a pure expression of his cinematic sensibility. The reason that some Lanthimos films —  Dogtooth  (2009),  The Killing of a Sacred Deer  (2017),  Kinds of Kindness  (2024) and especially  The Lobster  (2015) — feel so much more satisfying and essential than his Oscar-winners —  The Favourite  (2018) and  Poor Things  (2023) — is simple: He co-wrote them, with longtime collaborator Efthimis Filippou. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That's important, because whenever Lanthimos shows up as both director and (co-)writer, he brings a consistent (some would say rigid), characteristic (some would say mannered) style. This approach tends to feature deliberately and hilariously stilted dialogue delivered with a flat affect that borders on monotone, which has the net effect of rendering the characters incapable of accessing the strong emotions that are roiling just below the film's impassive surface. There's also, not for nothing, that bleakness. The abject, unutterable (and therefore  very  funny), kind of bleakness I associate with the comics of Charles Burns and Chris Ware – a bleakness that is total, and inexorable, and endlessly, hilariously resilient. Bugonia  was written by Will Tracy. Here, Lanthimos can't avail himself of his signature style — that affectless affect — because the story he's telling won't permit it. He's forced to adopt a more naturalistic approach, because he needs Emma Stone's character — the CEO trapped in Plemons' basement — to be fully, recognizably, empathetically human. He wants to place us in that basement alongside her, making the shrewd, calculating assessments of her situation that we imagine we would, if we were in her straits. Stone is dependably marvelous as a woman deftly reading her captors' moods and body language, and expertly negotiating her way towards freedom. For the film to work — and it largely does — it can't exist within the hermetically sealed bubble that typifies the films Lanthimos both directs and co-writes. It has to feel more immediate, more grounded, more real. But there's a coldness, here — a coldness that's absolutely necessary in films like  The Lobster  and  The Killing of a Sacred Deer , where it works to delineate and define the idiosyncratic world. In  Bugonia , however, that same dispassionate directorial remove feels out of place, and can't help but interpose itself between the audience and the characters, numbing our reaction to them. Ready for their close-up That distancing effect is amplified by Lanthimos' deliberate but frustrating disinclination to let his two leads truly act together, in any given scene. Bugonia  lives in a series of alternating close-ups of Stone's and Plemons' faces. We're tight on a given character while they're talking, then we cut to the other character saying their bit, then back to the other character as they resume talking. But acting, as they say, is reacting, and Lanthimos largely denies us reaction shots. It's something that you first notice unconsciously: Teddy says something provocative that we know Michelle would object to, yet we never cut away to her, we stay on Plemons' face. When he's done talking we cut to Michelle, who insults Teddy, but if it gets a rise out of him, we won't know it until it gets to be his turn again. It's a deliberate choice, or course: Lanthimos wants the film to read as a battle of wills between his leads. They are two people forcefully asserting, in turn, their clashing versions of reality, without ever listening to each other, without ceding any ground. They talk  at  each other, but nothing ever sinks in, nothing ever sways the other person even minutely; they just keep talking. (Contrast this with Delbis' character Donny, whose entire presence in the film exists as a series of reaction shots. That's intentional too — Donny is the heart of the movie, its soft chewy center; he's a sponge who absorbs absolutely everything Teddy and Michelle say to him, even though they contradict each other; he spends the entirety of the film being acted upon, ruthlessly manipulated.) The decision to bifurcate the film in this way makes sense on a technical level, I suppose, as it serves the film's themes of loneliness and alienation. But it's never anything less than frustrating to watch two of the finest film actors of the age delivering what amounts to a series of choppy mini-monologues instead of engaging in the true exchange of dialogue. Worst. Needle drop. Ever. I've now talked to several critics and non-critics about the film and a kind of consensus has evolved — several say they like the film in general, but dislike, or hate, the ending. I'll be careful here, but: When I hear that take, I always follow up with them. Do you mean the  resolution  of the film, or the  final few minutes  of the film? If they tell me they disliked how the film resolves a central question about the presence or absence of aliens, I disagree with them strongly, because I think the film's final act is kind of hilarious, and includes some terrific, grotesquely beautiful visual imagery. But if they tell me they hated those last few minutes — those last three minutes and 37 seconds, to be precise, when Marlene Dietrich's cover of \"Where Have all the Flowers Gone?\" is played? Then yeah, they're right, it's terrible. Mind-bogglingly  terrible, and a testament to the power of a single musical choice — a single, punishingly literal, ham-fisted, achingly obvious needle drop that occurs at the very, very end of a film — to poison the two hours of innovative, exciting filmmaking that precedes it. It's not just the song itself, but the fact that Lanthimos chooses to let it unspool in its entirety, all five verses. That's a serious chunk of screentime to devote to a single tune, and when you factor in that it's played over imagery that becomes thuddingly repetitive and overbearing by the two-minute mark, the choice is so mystifyingly bad that this Lanthimos devotee found himself questioning how a filmmaker he admires so much could biff the dismount in such an exhaustive and exhausting manner. When will they ever learn, indeed.

Take this quiz to find out \n         By Kia Miakka Natisse, Clare Marie Schneider, Connie Hanzhang Jin, Koko Nakajima \n        \n           Tuesday, February 15, 2022 • 12:03 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         How do you feel when your partner doesn't respond to your text right away? Is it easy for you to express your feelings to friends or loved ones, or do you struggle? Do you stay in touch with exes? Worry your current partner will leave you? How you answered those questions can offer some insight into your attachment style. According to the field of attachment theory, each person has a unique attachment style that informs how you relate to intimacy: secure, anxious, avoidant and a small subset who are anxious-avoidant.  This quiz, adapted from Amir Levine and Rachel Heller's bestselling book,  Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find — and Keep  —  Love , will help you figure out your own attachment style.  Research has shown  that even just knowing about the four attachment styles can positively influence your relationships. \"It helps people become more secure,\" says Levine, who is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia University.  And though you may not have a choice in which attachment style you have, it's not just up to you to address it — other people have a role to play too. \"It's something that happens in the space between two people. They think, 'Oh, I have this attachment style, so I have to fix it by fixing myself.' But it's a relational thing,\" says Levine. He recommends creating a \"secure village\"— surrounding yourself with secure people as a way to make yourself more secure. Curious about your partner's attachment style?  This quiz can help .

Today, we're talking attachment styles, which are very popular these days. You've probably seen people online talking about how they can help you in relationships. And though it might feel new, it's actually an old idea that first started in the parenting world. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AMIR LEVINE: So the founder of attachment theory with children initially is John Bowlby, and he made this idea leap at the time. NATISSE: This was back in the 1950s, when the general belief was that babies just needed food and shelter and that distancing yourself - not holding them too much, letting them cry and generally just leaving them alone - was good parenting. LEVINE: But Bowlby thought differently. Bowlby thought that - he took different, separate type of basic need that humans have to attach to others. NATISSE: That's Amir Levine. He's a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia University and also the co-author of \"Attached: The New Science Of Adult Attachment.\" John Bowlby's research showed that it wasn't actually just about making sure the baby has food and a roof over their head. A secure relationship with a parent or caretaker played a major factor in their development. LEVINE: You can provide children with all of the physical sustenance that they need, like food and shelter, but if you don't interact with them and there isn't an attachment, they will actually fail to thrive. NATISSE: There are four basic attachment styles - secure, anxious, avoidant and anxious avoidant. Eventually, years of research and experiments revealed that not only did children have different attachment styles, those styles could continue into adulthood, showing up in their romantic relationships. That said, it isn't just about how you were raised. Other dynamics, like temperament, genetics and early romantic experiences, can play a major part in your attachment style. The point is that we all have an innate need for connection. LEVINE: We have brain circuitry that is designed to choose a person out from the crowd and make them special and important. And we do it to a large degree not just with our significant other. We do it also with friends, but to a much higher degree with significant others. And if there are none available to us, it will sort of - we will feel a great distress. NATISSE: And you're saying it's biological. We actually have no choice. We do this whether or not, maybe, we're conscious of it, where we choose an important person. LEVINE: Right. So why would you blame someone who is really, really craving a relationship? But in our society, sometimes there's judgment about that and this whole idea that, oh, that means that something is wrong with you. You have to learn to love yourself first before you love someone else. But that's not our biology. Our biology doesn't work that way. We are extremely social species. In fact, it's kind of like the opposite. We can learn to love ourselves better through other people. NATISSE: And though you may not have a choice in which attachment style you are, it's not just up to you to address it. Other people have a role to play, too. LEVINE: It's something that happens in the space between two people. They think, oh, I have this attachment style, so I have to fix it by fixing myself. But it's a relational thing. NATISSE: Even just learning about the different attachment styles can impact your relationships. LEVINE: And actually, there was a recent paper that came out that says that just by knowing about those attachment styles, it helps people become more secure. NATISSE: Oh, that's really... LEVINE: I know. NATISSE: ...Great news. LEVINE: So that's great news for anyone who's going to listen now to this show. NATISSE: In this episode of NPR's LIFE KIT, Amir Levine explains the different attachment styles, how to figure out your own and others, plus how to use that awareness to have healthier, more connected relationships. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) NATISSE: So I know there are different attachment styles. What are the different styles, and how do you figure out which one you are? LEVINE: So there's the anxious, avoidant, secure, and there's a small segment of the population that's anxious and avoidant. And it all has to do with how comfortable you feel with intimacy and closeness, but also how sensitive of a radar do you have for potential disruption in that closeness. NATISSE: So do you want to break it down from the, like, four different types - how they respond to that radar system? LEVINE: Yeah. If we love, love intimacy and closeness, but yet we have the very sensitive radar system - like we can read a lot of things as potential threats - then we have an anxious working model. And the truth is that research finds that people with anxious attachment styles are actually better at identifying potential threats than other attachment styles. So it's not all in their head. It's like... NATISSE: Yeah. LEVINE: ...There's an advantage sometimes of sort of being able to see danger. It's like having a sixth sense for danger... NATISSE: Right. LEVINE: ...But sometimes also seeing danger where there isn't any. So then if we love intimacy and closeness but we actually don't really have a very sensitive radar system, a lot of stuff goes over our head - oh, they're there. They're not there. It's fine. We don't really - it's like, we don't notice it, even. It just like - then we have a secure attachment style 'cause... NATISSE: OK. LEVINE: ...We love closeness, but we're not that - the person - they show up late from work, or they show up, like, upset from work or - like, we don't pay much attention to that. We don't really see it as a threat. NATISSE: OK. LEVINE: But that is the secure. And the avoidant is - they also have this mechanism of making someone else special. But when that happens, something strange happens. They want the closeness, but they don't like too much closeness. So what they do is they use what we call deactivating strategies, which is any strategy that will actually cause some distance in their relationship, in order to still be together with someone but a little bit more, like, at arm's length, at a distance. So that's the avoidant attachment style. NATISSE: So you kind of mentioned this before, but thinking about, like, some of the judgments around these attachment styles - and I really appreciate the way you described secure attach because as an anxious person, you know, like, secure just seems so idealized. But what you're also saying is that, oh, they are not also always picking up on things that maybe other people are that could be helpful. You know, so I guess, should we be judging these styles as, like, good or bad? Is there a healthy way to think about these categories? LEVINE: It's such a good question because one of the reasons why I love this field so much is because it's not embedded in a medical theory way of thinking, where a lot of things are either healthy or sick or... NATISSE: Right. LEVINE: ...Psychopathology. NATISSE: Yeah. LEVINE: It really looks at variations - normal variations in the population. So we're not talking about any, like, mental illness here or being healthy or sick. We're talking about the normal variation in the population. NATISSE: Yeah. Do attachment styles change over time? Are we, like, set in our ways? Or is there some flexibility around - like, can I become a more secure person? LEVINE: The answer is definitely yes. And that's another reason why I love this field so much because, especially as a therapist, to think that there is this framework in which people can change and change a lot is very promising to me. And not everybody can change to the same degree, but we can all try and strive for it. One of the main things that I think people don't appreciate enough is how scary it can be, actually, becoming more secure initially, just because, like, we're so set in our ways and things are so familiar, then all of a sudden - it's almost like reaching, like, a different planet. And one of the ways of - the best ways of becoming more secure is surrounding yourself by more secure people. If your partner is secure, you lucked out big time. But even if they're not secure, you can find additional people in your life that are more secure. But initially, sometimes it doesn't feel comfortable when you meet someone secure because you expect something else, and you don't know how to handle that exactly. Part of the work is to tell people, just take a deep breath and take it in and trust me that in the long run it will be worth it. NATISSE: Yeah. In the book, you have all these different sort of quizzes and tables to help people figure out their attachment style. What do you do with that information? How can we use attachment theory to improve our connections it sounds like not just with our romantic partners, but with other people that we really care about too, right? LEVINE: Yes, definitely. So in the book, we did two things. We sort of adopted a questionnaire about deciphering your own attachment style, but we went a step further and we put in a questionnaire of how you can identify other people's attachment style. You can pretty easily tell what other people's attachment styles are. Sometimes it's harder than others, but a lot of the time it's pretty easy. And then that really puts you on a different plane. For example, I had a supervisor at work, and she had an extreme - extremely, extremely anxious attachment style - so much so that it used to drive me to distraction. I just didn't know what to do. She would call and call and call, and it was like, OK, I'm so tired of this person. I would just, like (laughter) - I would just hit ignore. But she would see that I'm hitting ignore. It would make her even more anxious, and she would call even more. And then, like, it will be unpleasant, to say the least, in the way that she would speak to me. And then I realized after thinking, oh, she has an anxious attachment style, it doesn't work, ignoring her. It only makes her resort to protest behavior - right? Then she calls me and lashes out at me. That's protest behavior. So that's very helpful to understand, rather than take it personally. It's much more efficient in the way that you then understand the situation, and it has an immediate way of correcting it. And the way to correct it is to - sometimes it's kind of, like, the opposite of what you think - is to make yourself available to the person. So then I've learned to even preemptively reach out and say, hey, I'm not done with this yet, but I'll be done with it in the day. NATISSE: Yeah. LEVINE: We call that sort of turning out a small flame before it becomes a forest fire. NATISSE: Right. LEVINE: So you identify that, and you make yourself more available. And lo and behold, the relationship really transformed. She was much more calm, and we were able to get a lot of work done together in a remarkable way. NATISSE: Yeah. So what it sounds like is that you're saying that, like, attachment style, A, can help you outside of romantic relationships. It's not just about who you're dating. LEVINE: For sure. NATISSE: But B, also help you to navigate, like, points of conflict with people. If you can learn what their sort of attachment style is and how it might be activated in whatever interaction, you could more efficiently learn how to navigate that instead of, like, almost - I mean, we would say, like, two people triggering each other. You know, like if... LEVINE: Yes. NATISSE: ...You're an avoidant or an anxious person, it can kind of step in the gap. LEVINE: You used one word that's, like, the key word, and the key word is efficiency. So we're not talking about good or bad. We're talking about, is it working for you or is it not working for you? For, like, avoidant people, they think, ugh, I don't want too much closeness, so I'm not going to text this person - like I did with my mentor. I'm not going to - I'm like, I'm just going to ignore them. I'm not going to text them. Or if they're calling me, I'm just like, I don't have time for them now, missing the point that this is going to lead to great inefficiency because they're going to end up to basically deal with a forest fire later. So it's actually in their best interest to maintain more quiet, so they can actually not have that much need for constant interaction to keep this whole attachment system quiet and at bay. And you can do that - doesn't need a lot. That's the most surprising thing. It doesn't need a lot in today - in our today's world. With texting and emailing and all that stuff, you can remain connected very easily by sort of giving small, little gestures to your partner. NATISSE: Yeah. What are those steps of, like, quieting an active sort of attachment system and understanding that, like, different people's - depending on your attachment style, it might manifest differently? But either which way, it's like, your attachment system is activated. How can someone quiet theirs? LEVINE: I like that people oftentimes think about, OK, it's been activated. Now I need to look after myself, and I need to quiet it down. But that's not exactly how we think from an attachment perspective because we always think about the dyad. We don't think about, OK, now you got to activate it, and now you have to go and quiet down because that's not how it works. NATISSE: OK. LEVINE: You are in a dyad, and something happens in the space between two people. And if you got activated, that means that someone activated you (laughter), right? And it's - that means that someone wasn't in tune enough toward your needs and that things got spiraled out of control. I'm a believer in actually figuring out what the other person needs and trying to find a way to do what they need and trying to find a mutual way in which then things work seamlessly. It's like a dance, figuring out how to not step on each other, and then you can dance together as a couple, and it looks marvelous. NATISSE: Right. OK, so what I'm hearing you say, though, is that, like, it's a two-person process. If you're - if attachment... LEVINE: Exactly. NATISSE: ...Is about two people, it can never just be on one person to say, like, oh, I'm going to go soothe my attachment system, because you're saying we have to acknowledge that a person's attachment system might have been inflared (ph) by their partner's actions, even if their partner might think, perhaps they're reacting in a way that doesn't feel necessary - because I feel like that's where the traps, at least - now I'm talking about myself. (LAUGHTER) NATISSE: But like, you get trapped in, like, a - you had an anxious reaction to something that's not worthy of being anxious about. How do you ask for what you need? LEVINE: So one of the things that I have to - that I tell all my patients, it's almost like you have to - we have to stop thinking from our prefrontal cortex, really, and you have to understand that attachment has a different logic to it. It has a completely different logic. And it's not - we tend to think what's right and what's wrong, and we tend to sort of fight over the details of things. Attachment doesn't care about the explicit details. It cares about the implicit details. We don't care so much about the action of what the person does. We care about the meaning that we assign to that action. From an attachment perspective, there's not really overreacting. I've learned not to underestimate our attachment system. It's a powerful force. And if you try to go against it, it's going to win. The thing is to understand the logic, and the logic is about availability. The message should be, I'm available. I'm here for you. I love you. I don't want you to get hurt. You're safe here. But when you start telling the person, you're overreacting and you get upset about it, the attachment system gets the message, oh, my God, you're not safe here. You should... NATISSE: Right. LEVINE: ...Turn it up a notch 'cause you're not safe here. It's also important to create yourself a secure village and other secure people around you because sometimes maybe you won't get what you need from your partner, but then what you can do is you can call a secure person - not someone who's going to say, oh, yeah, my God, this person is a jerk. How can they treat you like that? How can they talk to you like that? No, no, no. You need someone who's going to really say, no, they love you so much. And, you know, here, yesterday, they brought you food, and they did this for you and that for you. And then you're like, oh, yeah, right. Yeah, I see that (laughter). And kind of like, phew, it all brings it all down. And it's a very important principle of secure priming. We can secure prime other people and ourselves. And sometimes, even just watching a movie where you can see, like, a secure relationship, that can sort of lead to secure priming. It's a very powerful thing, and it can last even for several weeks. So the one big thing is, like, thinking that we need to go it all alone. We live in such an individualized culture when we forget that we never do anything alone.

Here's what to know \n         By Michelle Andrews \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This year's Obamacare open enrollment period, which starts Saturday in most states, is full of uncertainty and confusion for the more than  24 million people  who buy health insurance through the federal and state Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The fate of the enhanced premium tax credits that make coverage more affordable for  92% of enrollees  remains up in the air, with the prospect of significantly  higher premiums looming . But there are steps marketplace shoppers can take to ensure they make the right choices for the upcoming plan year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. Understand how we got here In 2021, as part of a COVID-era relief package, the ACA premium tax credits were enhanced to lower costs for previously eligible people and expand eligibility to people with incomes over 400% of the federal poverty level (which amounts to  about $63,000  for one person in 2025). But those enhancements, which were extended in 2022,  will expire  at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts. The debate over whether to extend them again has been at the center of a political battle of wills between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, a fight at the heart of the now month-old  government shutdown. The financial implications for many marketplace enrollees are huge. Average out-of-pocket premium payments for subsidized enrollees are projected to more than double if the enhanced tax credits expire, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. \"The longer this goes on, the more damage is done,\" said  Cynthia Cox , a vice president and the director of the Program on the ACA at KFF. \"If someone logs on Nov. 1 and sees their premium doubling, they might just walk away.\" That would be a mistake, marketplace experts agree. What is clear, though, is that buyers need to beware and be informed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Follow the news It can be frustrating to track day-to-day Capitol Hill machinations. But that may be your best source for up-to-date information. Congress could make a deal to extend the enhanced subsidies anytime during the next few days, weeks or months -- or not. Either way, it could affect your enrollment decision. So, pay attention. Don't count on the marketplace or your insurer to notify you about what you should expect to pay. \"Many state marketplaces have hit delay\" on sending consumers notices of net premiums, which take premium tax credits into account, said  Sabrina Corlette , a co-director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. The federal government doesn't send enrollees notices about plan premiums for the coming year for the  28 federally facilitated  marketplaces. For 2026, it has said that health plans can also  opt not  to. 3. Update your account information and don't auto-enroll Log in to your marketplace account and update your income, household size, and any other details that have changed. This year, it's particularly important to provide an accurate estimate of your anticipated income for 2026. A provision in HR 1, sometimes called the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act ,  eliminated the caps  on what many people were required to repay if they underestimated their projected income and received more premium assistance than they should have. Next year, people will have to repay the entire excess amount. In the past few years, it's been possible to put your ACA insurance on auto-pilot with  automatic reenrollment  in your current or a similar plan. Given the uncertainty around premiums, this is not a good year to do that, enrollment specialists say. This is especially true for people who, without a deal in Congress, will no longer qualify for subsidies next year, specifically those whose incomes are over 400% of the federal poverty level. 4. Shop based on sticker prices When people see their projected premiums, assuming Congress hasn't reached a deal to extend the enhanced credits, many will be shocked. Health insurance premiums on the marketplaces are expected to increase, on average, 26% next year,  according to KFF . That's the largest rate increase since 2018. Until now, people have largely been shielded from those increases by the enhanced premium tax subsidies that nearly all enrollees receive. Here's how it works: Most people with ACA marketplace plans are responsible for paying a portion of their premium based on a sliding income scale, and the government pays the rest. According to an analysis by KFF, if the enhanced credits are not renewed, a family of four with $75,000 in income, for example,  will be responsible  for paying $5,865 in annual premiums for a benchmark silver plan in 2026 — more than double the $2,498 it'll pay if they are renewed. When evaluating a plan, focus on the listed price. If it's not affordable without the enhanced tax credits, it's not a good buy. \"People need to make a decision based on what is in front of them,\" Cox said. If you can't afford the sticker price without the enhanced credits, consider enrolling in a less generous plan with a lower premium but a higher deductible, Cox said. Bronze plans must provide comprehensive coverage, including covering preventive care at no cost, and may cover some doctor visits before the deductible. \"In most cases, it makes more sense to have a bronze plan than to be uninsured,\" she said. The Trump administration has been promoting  catastrophic plans  as a more affordable option for people who face financial hardship, including those who don't qualify for subsidies because their incomes are either less than 100% or more than 400% of the federal poverty level. Similar to bronze plans, catastrophic plans cover a set of essential health benefits, provide free preventive care, and must cover at least three doctor visits before people reach their deductible. But catastrophic plan deductibles are the highest of any type of marketplace plan: $10,600 for individuals and $21,200 for families in 2026. \"They are expensive relative to what they cover,\" said  Jennifer Sullivan , director of health coverage access at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noting premiums can cost several hundred dollars. 5. Come back, check, and recheck If you're dismayed at premium prices on your first pass, \"don't slam the computer shut and decide that there are no options for you,\" Sullivan said. \"Congress might still act and things might change radically.\" Lawmakers could restore the enhanced premium tax credits right up to the end of the year, or later. In a majority of states, including the 28 that use the federal government's centralized marketplace, open enrollment lasts until Jan. 15. There are also other key dates to remember. In most states, people  must enroll  by Dec. 15 for coverage starting Jan. 1, and by Jan. 15 for coverage starting Feb. 1, though some states have later deadlines. 6. Wait to pay your premium Premium payments are generally due before the plan takes effect, although marketplaces and insurers have flexibility to extend deadlines, Corlette said. They might allow people extra time to make a first payment, for example. \"We've seen that in the past. State officials and insurance companies have gotten creative to try and keep people in coverage,\" she said. But if there is a last-minute deal and someone has already paid their premium for January coverage and received a lower tax credit than the deal provides, they should still be able to receive the higher credit. \"There are ways to make people whole,\" Corlette said, although how that might happen this enrollment period is unclear.

On my bedside table, I have a little display of their mementos: the address book that belonged to my  abuela , or my grandmother in Spanish; the lenses from my grandfather's eyeglasses; and a cassette tape of children's songs in Polish (a gift from my great uncle), among other things.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       These items are a reminder of the love I have for my family — and of the wisdom they've passed down to me.  Ancestral altars, as they're called, are common around the world. In Mexico, people create an  ofrenda , or altar, to remember loved ones on  Día de los Muertos , or Day of the Dead. And in many Buddhist traditions and African religions, altars have a permanent space in the household so people can honor the dead not just once a year but every day.  Altars are for everybody, says  Ehime Ora , who teaches people about African spirituality and how to pay homage to their family lineage. \"You don't have to be religious or part of the Indigenous spirituality of any culture. Absolutely anyone can create [an altar] and an ancestor veneration practice.\"  While there are many ways to connect with your ancestors, altars offer a \"sacred place\" that can help remind you \"that you're not alone in the world, you're not alone with your problems,\" says  Camara Meri Rajabari , a psychotherapist who helps Black, Indigenous and people of color explore their ancestral roots.  Interested in setting up an altar at home and starting a ritual to honor your ancestors? Spiritual practitioners and Indigenous educators share a cross-cultural guide.  Step 1: Explore your intentions Before you make an altar, figure out  why  you want to connect with your ancestors.  Maybe you want to bring their values into your daily life, says  Chelsey Luger , who co-authored  The Seven Circles: Indigenous Teachings for Living Well  with her husband Thosh Collins. The book offers health and wellness guidance rooted in Indigenous ancestral practices. Luger is a member of the Anishinaabe and Lakota nations. Her ancestral teachings have taught her the phrase  Mitakuye Oyasin , which means \"we are all related\" in the Lakota language. \"Everybody is a part of this greater web and nobody is greater or less than anybody else,\" she says. Paying homage to her ancestors reminds her of this philosophy — and her place in the world.  Keep in mind that your why doesn't have to be spiritual. You might create an ancestral altar to simply remember those who paved the way for you, Ora says. \"If you don't want to look at it as a spiritual practice, look at it as a moment of gratitude for just existing.\" Step 2: Choose a special spot for your altar  I put my altar on my bedside table because it's filled with my most treasured possessions, items that I wanted to have near me while I sleep.  Ora says my altar placement is perfectly OK — there isn't one right place for an altar. \"I've had altars that were on top of dressers, tables, inside closets and even a suitcase.\"  As long as it's a designated space for \"intentional, formal communication with our people,\" that's all that matters, she adds. Step 3: Display objects that represent your ancestors While an altar's contents and style may vary according to culture, religion and tradition, its basic purpose is to \"house our ancestral energies,\" says Rajabari.  In many ancestral traditions, objects, symbols and belongings such as crystals, dolls and photos are displayed at an altar to embody our ancestors' energy, she says. These things \"carry an energetic signature that connects with our sense of history and our imagination, which will give us the parts of [our] history that may have been lost.\"  See if your family can give you any family heirlooms or tchotchkes to add to your altar. Maybe your mom's cousin is sitting on a collection of buttons from a beloved great aunt, or maybe somebody inherited all the childhood photos of your great grandparents.  If you don't have items that belonged specifically to your family members, find things to represent them. Although Luger does not have an ancestral altar at home, she says she keeps \"objects that we have spiritual reverence for.\" That includes a bottle of Givenchy perfume, the kind her grandmother would always wear. As for me, I have a Julio Iglesias cassette tape that I found at a vintage store on my altar, because my Titi Margot loved his music.  If you don't know these details about your ancestors, talk to older family members and ask them for information, which you can then use to find objects for your altar, says Ora.  \"For example, if your parent said their mother was interested in gardening, ask them if they remember what her favorite flower was. Now you have an item that can go on your ancestral altar – and an offering that you can lay for your grandmother.\" Once you have these things, arrange them at your altar.  Step 4: Start a ritual  Sometimes \"we need a set of actions to help us to acknowledge things that are very sacred and special to us,\" says Collins, who co-founded  Well for Culture , an Indigenous wellness group, with Luger.  Rajabari says a prayer and meditates at her altar every morning. \"I talk to [my ancestors] about mundane things or I may bring them my challenges,\" she says.  In many African religious traditions, says Ora, it's common to leave offerings, such as food, for your loved ones. \"Just as food provides us with nutrients for our health, this has a similar effect with our ancestors. It provides them with the strength to deliver on your prayers and grow the bond between you both.\"  As for my own ritual? I say good morning to each of my relatives. Sometimes I'll light a candle. Or I'll put on my grandmothers' rings.  I never got to know most of my grandparents and certainly not their parents. But when I sit at my altar, it honors the fact that they lived. And that brings me a lot of peace.  Your turn: How do you stay connected to your ancestors?  What is your relationship like with your ancestors?

I'm Marielle Segarra. There's this kind of parable that gets repeated sometimes. It's about a ham. It goes something like this. Mom's making a ham for a holiday dinner, and she cuts off the end of it and throws it away, which she always does. And her kid is like, Mom, why do you do this? You know, you're wasting good ham. And the mom says, I don't know. It's what my mom used to do. Now Grandma is not around anymore. So the kid goes to Grandpa and says, Grandpa, why did Grandma always cut off the end of the ham? And Grandpa's like, oh, our oven was too small for the whole thing. The point, my friends, is that we learn a lot of things from our parents who learn them from their parents and so on. Behaviors and practices and ways of seeing the world that may or may not be serving us anymore. Camara Meri Rajabari told me a version of this story. She's a licensed marriage and family therapist in Oakland, Calif., and she goes by the ancestral psychotherapist because she helps her clients understand how their ancestors' lives affect their lives today. CAMARA MERI RAJABARI: To try to understand what has been passed down that's been a real gift for us and those things that have been passed down that maybe we are finally ready to release. SEGARRA: Camara says learning about your ancestors can be joyful and surprising. RAJABARI: Maybe there was a long line of herbalists you didn't know about or a long line of musicians. SEGARRA: And that getting to know the people who came before you can help you understand yourself. She told me about a philosophy called Sankofa, which comes from Akan culture in Ghana. RAJABARI: Sankofa is often depicted as a bird looking over its shoulder. And the bird, for many of us, symbolizes liberation and freedom. And so in order to fly forward into the future and be free, be liberated, there's something in the past that's important to take with you. SEGARRA: People from all over the world have traditions of connecting with their ancestors - in Mexico, Vietnam, India, Egypt, Scotland, the Philippines, Korea and so many other places. Today on the show, why you might want to connect with your ancestors and how to do it. We'll give you some basic genealogy tips, talk about how to process what you find and help you come up with rituals and practices that feel right to you. So you want to connect with your ancestors. A good place to start - and this is takeaway No. 1 - figure out your why. And, you know, maybe it's super-practical, like you want to understand what medical ailments they had and whether there's anything genetic you need to know about. Or maybe your why has to do with understanding your behaviors and not just how you chop ham. As Camara was saying, we inherit things from our ancestors, whether we knew them or not. So we know that the way our parents experience the world can imprint on us. Like maybe your dad was always anxious. So as a kid you learned to walk on eggshells around him so he wouldn't get upset. And then you took that behavior into your adult relationships. You're constantly worried about triggering your partner or your friends. The thing is that pattern probably didn't start with Dad. RAJABARI: It might have began with your grandparents. It might have began with your great-grandparents. SEGARRA: Think of it as a chain reaction. RAJABARI: And depending on your family history, what your family's been through, maybe enslavement, holocausts, famine, we can think of all kinds of, like, major historical events that might have affected family lines. SEGARRA: Or maybe one of your ancestors was in a bad accident or had a sick parent for most of their life, and that caused a lot of anxiety. Camara helps her clients understand these deep roots. RAJABARI: How is it that I can tap into their story and understand where it came from so that I can begin to respond differently - how you can shape your life and your relationships differently? SEGARRA: For a lot of people, ancestry also becomes part of a spiritual practice. If you believe that life doesn't end when you die, your intention might be to connect with family members who've passed on. Alison Cox (ph) grew up in Australia and now lives in New York. And they've had a lot of highs and lows in the past couple of years. So they started doing this thing, imagining their ancestors supporting them. She sent us this voice memo. ALISON COX: If I'm having a moment where I just have so much emotion inside of me for either good or bad, I sort of just, like, envision that shooting out into the universe as, like, a signal. And then if I'm successful and I've signaled them, I sort of see all of these faceless figures gathered around me. SEGARRA: They don't literally see their ancestors with their eyes, by the way. She's picturing them. Alison is Chinese and white and never really got to know their Chinese side of the family. Also, she moved to the U.S. alone as a teenager to go to boarding school and most of her family is abroad. She says it's nice to have the numbers to bolster her in these moments. COX: To be able to be like, oh, my God, 50 people just saw me do that amazing thing, as opposed to just being like, oh, I'm going to text my mom and dad that I got an amazing job offer or something. SEGARRA: It also gives Alison comfort to think that death isn't the end. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Another reason you might want to know your ancestors is to tap into some of their wisdom. You know, how did they live? What lessons could they teach you? THOSH COLLINS: This concept that we talk about in Native communities is known as generational thinking. SEGARRA: Thosh Collins comes from the O'odham, Osage and Seneca-Cayuga tribal nations. COLLINS: We're thinking about what we're doing here and now today has that impact, has a ripple effect for the next seven generations. So I think that that's why it's important for people to acknowledge who they come from. SEGARRA: Thosh co-founded Well for Culture, an Indigenous wellness initiative, with his wife, Chelsey Luger. They've got a podcast and a book. Chelsey is Anishinaabe and Lakota. She says that growing up, her community talked about ancestors all the time and absorbed lessons from them. For instance... CHELSEY LUGER: My Lakota ancestral teachings have a phrase called mitakuye oyasin, which means we are all related or all my relatives. And it just means that everything is connected - living and non-living, humans, plant life, animal life. Everybody is a part of this greater web, and nobody is greater or less than anybody else. SEGARRA: Chelsea says her ancestors' philosophy helps her understand the world, to raise her children, to be a good partner. That's important to know, because Chelsea says there's often this misconception. LUGER: People wonder whether we as Indigenous people are stuck in the past. But what I wish people could recognize is that, in fact, we're so future-thinking. And that's why we talk about our ancestors. We're very determined to create a better world for the future generations and for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren and their descendants that we will never know. SEGARRA: Chelsea and Thosh think of themselves as future ancestors. And as you dig into your family lines, maybe that idea resonates for you, too. OK. So once you know why you want to connect with your ancestors, it's time for takeaway No. 2 - learn about them. How do you do that? MICA L ANDERS: You dig (laughter). You dig, you dig, and you dig, and you dig. So you start to look for clues. SEGARRA: Yep. Roll up your sleeves and get out your notebooks, detectives. Mica L. Anders is a professional genealogist in Minnesota. She says one of the places a lot of people start is ancestry.com. ANDERS: Ancestry has a subscription, but if you go to a lot of your local libraries, you can use it for free. SEGARRA: And there are other options too, like myheritage.com, which has a free basic subscription. And there are a lot of state and local records available online. Mica says you're looking for three main types of documents - first, the vital records. ANDERS: Your birth records, marriage records, death records. SEGARRA: Second, the census - the government releases the detailed records with names and everything in batches, but not until many years later to protect people's privacy. The most recent documents available are from 1950. ANDERS: Oftentimes, that's a place you can see the name of the mom, dad and all the kids if they had more of a traditional family structure. Sometimes you see second marriages. Sometimes you see parents living with their kids in terms of, like, adult children. Sometimes siblings, adult siblings live together. It just gives you that snapshot of what their life was like. SEGARRA: And third, you can look at newspapers. The Library of Congress has a free database of historic newspapers called \"Chronicling America.\" And there are paid websites, too, like newspapers.com and newspaperarchive.com. By the way, Mica had so many great tips that we couldn't include here that we will be publishing a longer version of that interview soon. Now, all the little details you'll find in newspaper articles can help you get a sense of what your ancestors' lives were like beyond names and dates. ANDERS: It'll say, oh, Sarah and her Aunt Jane went to Milwaukee for the day to visit their cousins. And then all of a sudden you get to know, oh, Sarah had an Aunt Jane. Why would Sarah and Aunt Jane have been traveling together? Oh, Sarah lived with Aunt Jane. Oh, who's in Milwaukee? Oh, that's where the other branch of the family I never knew about because there's no records tying them together. But this random little newspaper blurb in this society section, as you will, will tell you that. SEGARRA: Another tip from Mica - go horizontal, not just vertical. ANDERS: I always tell people, you know, focus not just on your immediate parents. Like, that's not even telling a full story. SEGARRA: For instance, Mica's grandfather was one of about 16 kids, and he was a chemistry professor. But she learned that a lot of his siblings became nuns and priests. ANDERS: Now I'm learning more about that whole family and sort of their devout Catholicism. SEGARRA: Now, when you're doing this research, it is very possible you will hit a brick wall, especially if you come from a community that has a harder time accessing records. Like Micah specializes in African American genealogy, and she says if you are African American, you might think you'll only get back to the late 1800s, post-Civil War. But that's not necessarily true. ANDERS: Maybe your family's not listed in a census, but maybe there are. It depends on where they lived. It depends on if they were a free person of color or if they were enslaved in the 1860s. So think outside of the box. Where would I look for these kind of records? OK, if they were enslaved, maybe I need to figure out who their enslaver was. And by finding that person's records, I will find documentation of the enslaved family as well. SEGARRA: Some places you could look for those records - state and local archives, also universities. Like, there's a big project at the University of Virginia where they're finding the records of people who were enslaved by the school. And also Facebook - there are groups where people whose ancestors owned slaves share these records. Whatever your background, Mica says when you do this digging, take your time. You're not going to piece together your entire family history right away. ANDERS: Really, the biggest thing in genealogy is it can be kind of like a wild goose chase. Like, oh, I found something. That's exciting. Oh, I found something else. That's exciting. And then you don't even really know what you found at the end. SEGARRA: It can help to zero in on a particular person. Do a deep dive. For example, in a census record from 1940, I learned about Maria, my bisabuela or great-grandmother. She was born in Puerto Rico in 1862 and she was una comadrona, a midwife. I asked Camara, the ancestral psychologist, where I could take it from there. She had some questions. RAJABARI: I would say Maria possibly was doing a lot of education in the community. Would you imagine that Maria was helping women with planning their fertility? You know, like, not only was your grandmother birthing the babies, but she may have been a very integral part of women's health. And how did that kind of funnel down to you? SEGARRA: Now, I'm a journalist, not a midwife. But Camara says there are echoes of Maria's work in mine. RAJABARI: You may still be midwifing, but you're midwifing something else. Do you get what I'm saying? Like, your midwifery might be making sure that people have information. SEGARRA: Especially when we do episodes of LIFE KIT that talk about reproductive health - you know, birth control or egg freezing. So maybe you find out that you came from a long line of musicians. How do you connect with that? Do you play music? Do you value creativity? Or maybe your great-grandfather was a farmer. What do you imagine his life was like? Can you relate? Maybe it's time to plant your own garden. That brings me to our next step. You've collected all these beautiful details about your ancestors. And that information doesn't just have to sit in a folder on your desktop. Takeaway No. 3 - get physical. So I told you about Maria. Turns out my dad's cousin has this old black-and-white photo of her sitting in a chair. I printed it out and it's now displayed on my bedside table, which also happens to be my ancestral altar. I didn't call it that at the start. At first it was just a couple objects and photos - my grandmother's prayer book, a Mass card from her mother's funeral, a candle. But it evolved over time. Now it's filled with other objects - my abuela's address book, a ring that belonged to my great-grandmother, the lenses from my grandfather's eyeglasses - also art and found objects, like a tiny wooden shot glass carved with the Taino symbol for the sun. If you want to make an altar, you can use your bedside table or a shelf, a cupboard or a shoebox. Camara says whatever space you choose... RAJABARI: It's a representation. It reminds you, depending on where you have it in your house, that you have this connection, that you're not alone in the world. You're not alone with your problems. SEGARRA: There are lots of ways to fill your altar. First of all, see if your family can help. Maybe your mom's cousin is sitting on a treasure trove of ancestral tchotchkes. Or maybe somebody inherited all the childhood photos of your great-grandparents. But if not, it's OK. Anything can represent an ancestor. A stone that reminds you of their eye color or a seashell. Chelsey Luger's Lakota grandmother would always wear a very specific type of Givenchy perfume. LUGER: And so I got a bottle of that. And, I mean, the smell, of course, reminds me of her, but also even just having the bottle - it's a way of connecting to a more recent ancestor. SEGARRA: You can also make an object - a doll, a drawing. And sometimes the objects will find you. Jeff Stout (ph) lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, and he sent us this voice memo. JEFF STOUT: This is regarding my son, Eric (ph). On the day of my son's funeral - and he was 31 when he died - I was getting ready and I heard something hit the floor. I looked down and there was a blue die, as in dice, on the floor, which I had never seen before. And my house is very clean and clutter-free. So it was if it fell from another dimension onto the floor. I never did figure out where it came from. But as far as I'm concerned, it came from him. So I keep this die in a black dish in the bathroom where I'm getting ready for work each day or for whatever I'm doing that day. I see the blue die, and it reminds me of him, and it's just the last gift I ever got from my son. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Chelsey says, by the way, you don't have to build a physical space to connect with your ancestors. The outdoors can be your altar, too. LUGER: Maybe if people don't have necessarily an altar at their bedside table or in their living room somewhere, they can think of a certain time of day that feels particularly sacred to them, such as when the sun is coming up in the morning or setting at night, and they can step outside and try to visualize and think about their ancestors, their descendants, and sort of expanding their intergenerational community and thinking about themselves as a part of that. SEGARRA: OK. So you figured out your why, you started learning about your ancestors and maybe you've created a space to connect with them. Next up - and this is takeaway No. 4 - create some rituals. Thosh Collins says sometimes we need a gesture. COLLINS: A sort of set of actions that help us to acknowledge things that are very sacred and special to us. SEGARRA: Rituals can help us feel grounded, and we can incorporate our ancestors into them. And Chelsey says these don't have to be elaborate. LUGER: My No. 1 piece of advice when it comes to creating rituals is try not to be performative or necessarily to think that it has to be this complicated thing or something that vaguely looks like what you've seen people in other cultures do. SEGARRA: You can just close your eyes and say a prayer or sit in a different spot than you normally would, light a candle. Alicia Lee (ph) lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. When she was 14, her grandmother died. And she has a ritual every year on the date of her grandmother's passing. ALICIA LEE: One, I free up the day, and I don't schedule any plans with anyone. Two, I make these Korean zucchini pancakes called hobak jeon and just regular potato chips that my grandma used to make for me whenever I went over to her place. And lastly, I write a letter to her in my journal. This is because I currently live in the States, and her grave is back in Korea. So I can't go there personally. But this is how I make it feel like I'm having a conversation with her, imagining how she might respond if I tell her, oh, I'm dating someone new, or, I got a new job. SEGARRA: If you have a conversation with your ancestors, you could say their names out loud, tell them about your day, ask them to guide you, or tell them if you're still processing something they did. Sometimes that conversation needs to happen with an ancestor who did things that were harmful. Maybe you loved them, but they had problems that impacted your family. Here's Camara. RAJABARI: So let's just go with the example of alcoholism. What I would say is that you could write a letter and talk about what you've observed in the family thus far. And if alcoholism has impacted you, you would talk about that in the letter. And then you could seal that letter and decide to do a ritual where you either burn it, or you can go outside and bury it. You can take it to nature and read it and, you know, seal it up and keep the letter. SEGARRA: Camara says this can be a helpful practice whether or not you're spiritual. Even if you don't think there's life after we die, it can still help to process these feelings as if you're having a conversation with the person. If you are spiritual, you could think of this as helping your ancestors to heal, too. RAJABARI: We can have relationships with our ancestors. It's just another set of relationships we're building. SEGARRA: Relationships that you might miss out on if you don't look back over your shoulder like the bird in Sankofa. OK, time for a recap. Takeaway one - figure out your why. What's your intention in getting to know your ancestors? Is this a spiritual practice? Is it more secular? There's a lot to learn either way. Takeaway two - learn about your ancestors. Start with the free resources, and remember to take your time. Also, go horizontal, not just vertical. You don't want to miss out on learning about Great-Aunt Mimi and all her adventures. Takeaway three - get physical. Build a space that represents your ancestors with photos and objects that remind you of them. And takeaway four - create some rituals. You can talk to your ancestors, write them letters, wish them a happy birthday, play their favorite music - whatever feels right. One parting thought from Camara - many of our ancestors didn't get a chance to tell their story. RAJABARI: They didn't live in a time where their story was even important. They may have not even been seen in society as having a voice. And so this work is about inviting in their voice through you. SEGARRA: I mean, what a beautiful idea.

should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 2:59 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government. \"THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE 'NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,\" Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began. Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a \"great deal\" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday. Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did \"powerful Republicans allow\" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government. His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight. Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill. \"People are stressing,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce. \"We are well past time to have this behind us.\" While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity — one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat — could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry. Money for military, but not food aid The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program. At the same time, many Americans who purchase their own health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces, with open enrollment also beginning Saturday, are experiencing sticker shock as premium prices jump. \"We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,\" said Rev. Ryan Stoess, during a prayer with religious leaders at the U.S. Capitol. \"God help us,\" he said, \"when the cruelty is the point.\" Deadlines shift to next week The House remains closed down under Johnson for the past month. Senators are preparing to depart Thursday for the long weekend. Trump returns late Thursday after a whirlwind tour of Asia. That means the shutdown, in its 30th day, appears likely to stretch into another week if the filibuster remains. If the shutdown continues, it could become the longest in history, surpassing the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump's first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The next inflection point comes after Tuesday's off-year elections — the New York City mayor's race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states' governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal. \"I hope that it frees people up to move forward with opening the government,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. GOP cut SNAP in Trump's big bill The Republicans, who have majority control of Congress, find themselves in an unusual position, defending the furloughed federal workers and shuttered programs they have long sought to cut — including most recently with nearly $1 trillion in reductions in Trump's big tax breaks and spending bill. Medicaid, the health care program, and SNAP food aid, suffered sizable blows this summer, in part by imposing new work requirements. For SNAP recipients, many of whom were already required to work, the new requirements extend to older Americans up to age 64 and parents of older school-age children. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans now \"have the nerve\" to suggest it's a political strategy to withhold food aid. \"We are trying to lift up the quality of life for the American people,\" Jeffries of New York said about his party. \"The American people understand that there's a Republican health care crisis,\" he said. \"The American people understand Republicans enacted the largest cut to nutritional assistance in American history when they cut $186 billion from their one, big, ugly bill.\" During the summer debate over Trump's big bill, Johnson and other Republicans railed against what they characterized as lazy Americans, riding what the House speaker calls the \"gravy train\" of government benefits. The speaker spoke about able-bodied young men playing video games while receiving Medicaid health care benefits and insisted the new work requirements for the aid programs would weed out what they called \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" \"What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said in spring on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all,\" he said. What remains out of reach, for now, is any relief from the new health care prices, posted this week, that are expected to put insurance out of reach for many Americans when federal subsidies that help offset those costs are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats have been holding out for negotiations with Trump and the Republicans to keep those subsidies in place. Republicans say they can address the issue later, once the government reopens. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/school-crossing-guard-fatal-traffic-accidents-725e0fdb61dd1246318028de92bc7add","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-20","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Green Valley Community Takes Action to Preserve Cultural Heritage","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the rural Green Valley Community, residents have taken proactive steps to preserve their unique cultural heritage.

The school crossing guard was walking into the crosswalk in front of Washington Township High School in Indianapolis when a car with a young boy and his mom, who was dropping him off at school, suddenly appeared. The mom’s eyes grew wide, and the boy began vigorously hitting on his mother’s chest. “Next thing, it was boom, lights out. That’s all I remember,” Taylor said. He woke up in the hospital hours after undergoing surgery for a fractured pelvis and other broken bones. In many ways, Taylor was lucky. Despite the broken bones and the pins and metal plates to heal his body from that August 2018 collision, he returned to work. Across the country, school crossing guards like Taylor, who stand in the cold, rain or heat to protect children, face the risk of injuries from drivers who may be distracted or in a hurry. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); An investigation by The Associated Press and Cox Media Group Television Stations found that over the past 10 years, hundreds of school crossing guards — many of them of retirement age or older -- have suffered injuries on the job after being hit by a vehicle, and dozens of them have died. A full accounting is impossible. No federal agencies and just two states track how many crossing guards are injured or killed each year . And local police accident reports often have no code to distinguish between school crossing guards and other pedestrians hit near schools.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “Officers rarely stop to consider whether the injured ‘pedestrian’ was on duty.” said former Cornelius, North Carolina, Police Chief Bence Hoyle. A database compiled by AP and Cox Media Group shows that 230 school crossing guards across 37 states and Washington, DC, were struck by vehicles. Nearly three dozen were killed in these collisions. The cases, compiled from incident and accident reports requested from nearly 200 police departments, represent only a portion of guards injured and killed nationwide. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The investigation shows that in these cases, drivers who hit or even kill crossing guards rarely face serious consequences. Of the incidents involving 183 crossing guards where an outcome could be determined, nearly half resulted in traffic citations — such as “failure to yield to a pedestrian.” About a quarter of the drivers weren’t ticketed at all, while just over a quarter faced criminal charges. Police said several factors go into whether or not a driver who hits a crossing guard is charged, including things such as weather conditions or negligence by the person operating the vehicle. Taken as a whole, these incidents highlight a largely underreported problem: Crossing guards, tasked with protecting children as they navigate busy streets in front of schools, can be casualties of dangerous roadways. “It’s a huge responsibility to step out in front of a vehicle,” said Dacia Maisonave, a crossing guard trainer in Seminole County, Florida. “It is unfortunate that our crossing guards don’t have a lot of laws. The only thing they really have to protect them is the stop paddle.” KEY FINDINGS FROM AP/COX MEDIA GROUP INVESTIGATION No way to track the total number of crossing guard injuries and deaths across the country: A database compiled by the AP and Cox Media Group shows that at least 230 school crossing guards across 37 states and Washington D.C., were struck by vehicles on the job over the last decade. Three dozen were killed. Drivers who hit crossing guards rarely face criminal charges, even if the injuries to crossing guards result in death: Of the 183 incidents involving crossing guards where an outcome could be determined, nearly half resulted in traffic citations– such as “failure to yield to a pedestrian.” About a quarter of the drivers weren’t ticketed at all, while a quarter faced criminal charges. Federal data analyzed by the AP show that crossing guard is among the most dangerous jobs: Crossing guards and road construction flaggers were in the top fifth for death rates on the job, a rate calculated by the AP based on analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data, on par with power line installers and air transportation workers. ▶ Click here to watch and read the stories produced by the eight Cox Media Group TV stations across the country. AP AUDIO: Crossing guards face life-threatening dangers on the job In part 1 of Disreguarded , AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on the dangers crossing guards face on a daily basis when they put themselves in dangers way. ‘Just slow down’ The lack of a system to track injuries and deaths of crossing guards has hampered efforts to develop better safety measures or even assess just how dangerous the job is, experts say. School crossing guard protection remains a patchwork of state and local policies. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes survey data for on-the-job injuries and deaths across most industries, but school crossing guards are included in a job category with road construction flaggers — and the agency does not publish a fatality rate for it. The AP calculated its own fatality rates for nearly 200 job classifications with at least 10,000 workers and 10 deaths in 2023, the most recent year of available records. Crossing guards and flaggers were in the top fifth of deadliest jobs, the AP’s analysis found, on par with power line installers and air transportation workers. It’s the only occupation in that top fifth that interacts with children daily. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Other federal agencies also rarely capture details specific to school crossing guards’ injuries or deaths. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s records on fatal accidents specify whether a school bus was involved or the crash happened within a designated school zone. But no information is captured about whether a victim was a crossing guard. Very few accident reports filed through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration mention school crossing guards. Only two states have made a serious effort to track crossing guard safety: New Jersey and Massachusetts. After examining the deaths of 16 crossing guards struck by motor vehicles and more than 230 injuries between 1993 and 2008, the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development launched a program aimed at crossing guard safety in February. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Officials in New Jersey said they target school zones for recurring safety inspections and have already issued eight serious violations and 30 others to employers for noncompliance. But even this pioneering effort faces limitations. “Since there are no crossing guard standards in New Jersey, there is only so much we can do but to make sure they have appropriate training,” says Assistant State Labor Commissioner Justin Baker. New Jersey state officials said they work with local police to provide training and proper equipment, including reflective vests. Michael Flanagan, director of the Department of Labor Standards in Massachusetts, said his state began tracking school crossing guard injuries and deaths when a guard was fatally struck in 2012. In 2022, he said the state mandated that cities and towns report crossing guard injuries. Labor experts say more can be done to make the job safer. Among possible solutions that remain underused in the U.S, experts say, are installing smart crosswalk systems with flashing LED lights, raised crosswalks, automated speed cameras or requiring all guards to wear high-visibility gear. Flanagan said ultimately the most effective measure for protecting cross guards from injuries and deaths comes from talking to and educating motorists. “Crossing guards are out there, and just slow down and be aware of that and look out for them,” he said. Close calls and deaths School crossing guards are employed by local police departments, school districts or private companies hired by schools. Many of them are older adults or retirees — of the 160 cases where AP and Cox Media Group were able to document ages, more than half were older than 65. In interviews, many guards say they enjoy their jobs. But they also recount almost daily close calls with hurried and distracted drivers who ignore posted warning signs and the guards themselves, even in crosswalks. Travis Callis, a former crossing guard in Martinsburg, West Virginia, said while he’s never been hurt, he’s had several close run-ins, including an instance where a car was so close he could feel its heat on the back of his legs. “I’m holding the sign up and they’re just driving at me,” he said.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More In some cases, collisions can kill. Last year, Stanley Brucker, 61, was working as a crossing guard at Fort Mill Elementary School in South Carolina when he was struck by a car as he was holding a stop sign and directing traffic. Video captured by a passing school bus shows a vehicle hitting Brucker and flipping him over the car as he stands in the crosswalk. He was transported to a nearby hospital but later died. Brucker was the fourth crossing guard to be hit or killed while working for the school district. His death caused many of the district’s crossing guards to refuse to show up for two days after they learned the driver who hit him wouldn’t face charges. “There is no indication that the driver of the vehicle was driving in a dangerous or reckless manner,” local prosecutors in the 16th Circuit Solicitor’s Office said in a statement at the time. Brucker’s family sees it differently and has filed a lawsuit against the school district and the driver who struck him. The lawsuit accuses the Fort Mill School District of choosing locations for crossing guards that were not “reasonably safe,” citing “the actual conditions on the site in the middle of a busy highway and by the numerous past instances of injury to crossing guards.” No trial date has been set for the case to be heard. In response to questions about the lawsuit, a spokesperson for the district wrote: “In light of the pending litigation, in which the actions of traffic guards employed by the company providing guards to the district is an issue, the district, on advice of counsel, is unable to respond further.” The Fort Mill School District and the driver who hit Brucker have both asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit. Before the start of this school year, district officials informed parents that public schools in Fort Mill will not have traffic guards. The district has installed a new traffic system to help improve safety in the absence of traffic guards. Rutledge Young, an attorney in Charleston, South Carolina, representing Brucker’s family, said Brucker was doing what he was told to do. “I believe that Mr. Brucker was doing his job and was killed as a result,” Young said. Across the country, data compiled by AP and Cox Media Group shows similar instances of guards being killed and drivers not facing criminal charges. James Arthur Holland of Lexington, Kentucky, a crossing guard with the local police department, was hit and killed in 2023 by a driver while working outside an elementary school. Police found that the driver did not have insurance or a driver’s license, and the vehicle’s registration had expired. Police said the incident was not a result of speeding or impairment, but environmental conditions. The driver was given various traffic citations, but no criminal charges were filed. Kevin VanFleet, a detective in the Simi Valley Police Department in California, said each collision must be looked at individually. He said several factors go into deciding if a driver is going to be charged, including what police -- who rarely witness the accident -- find during their investigation and whether local prosecutors feel charges are warranted. “Not everybody that is involved in a collision, let’s say, with a pedestrian in a crosswalk, or perhaps a crossing guard in a crosswalk, is going to receive an infraction ticket. It depends on the severity of it,” VanFleet said One common explanation for drivers hitting crossing guards that emerges from a review of traffic and incident reports is the glare of sunlight. “The sun was in my eyes,” appears repeatedly in reports obtained by AP and Cox Media Group. Last year, Patricia Davis, a guard in Monroe County, Georgia, about an hour east of Atlanta, was hit by a truck while helping students cross. The driver told law enforcement that the sun was directly in his eyes, and he didn’t see Davis until his truck struck her. Davis was taken to the hospital after suffering minor injuries. The driver was not charged. Police labeled the collision an accident. Dave Peavy, 76, a crossing guard in Gardner, Kansas, wasn’t as fortunate. Peavy, a Vietnam veteran who wore a Santa hat and passed out candy to kids crossing his intersection, was hit and killed by a car as he stepped out to stop traffic. The driver, who was not charged, told police that sunlight blinded him, and he never saw Peavy. Crossing guards said these cases and dozens more like them highlight how drivers rarely face serious consequences when one of them is severely injured or killed. Beyond distracted drivers and the glare of sunlight, experts point to multiple other factors that compromise crossing guard safety. The higher hoods of today’s SUVs and trucks create larger blind spots that reduce visibility. Many school zones lack adequate traffic-slowing measures like speed bumps or automated enforcement cameras. And many local roads are designed to prioritize vehicle flow over pedestrian safety and have inadequate sight lines and insufficient buffer zones around crosswalks. Still, former Police Chief Hoyle in North Carolina said drivers should be held accountable for injuring or killing crossing guards. He suggests raising speeding tickets in school zones to $1,000 and implementing license plate recognition systems to track down reckless drivers. “The penalties should be much higher, making drivers think twice about speeding through a school zone,” Hoyle said. VanFleet, the Simi Valley Police Department detective in California, said greater police presence in school zones would likely be more effective than fines. “It’s not so much the cost of the infraction it would be that would cause a deterrence,” he said. “It would be having more officers out there doing more enforcement. Not enough is being done Among the incidents where AP and Cox Media Group could determine an outcome, around a quarter resulted in criminal charges. About 40% of those criminal charges occurred when the driver fled the scene. Last year in Uvalde, Texas, elementary school crossing guard George Juarez was hospitalized after a pickup truck hit him and the driver fled the scene. The driver hit the crossing guard after making an illegal left turn as Juarez attempted to redirect the truck that struck him. The driver was charged with driving while intoxicated with an open container, and failure to stop and render aid.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The driver that hit and killed Steven Winn, a 67-year-old crossing guard in Layton, Utah, just after he helped a group of elementary students cross to school, was also charged with an even more serious offense — negligent homicide. Families who lose loved ones in fatal traffic accidents say the unexpected financial burden can be staggering, since many guards are retirees who work part-time and don’t have benefits. Dozens of current and former guards or their families have set up GoFundMe pages to help cover medical and funeral costs. Those who survive hits can endure a long, painful recovery as well as mounting medical expenses. Ron Ferguson was hit by a truck in 2020 while directing traffic in front of a local high school in Texarkana, Texas. The collision left him with a cracked skull, missing teeth and lingering damage to his left ear. Ferguson spent two weeks sedated while recovering. He couldn’t breathe on his own or get out of bed, and needed nearly a month of grueling rehabilitation. Today, he said, he has mostly recovered, but some scars from the accident remain and he still has trouble with his memory. “There are times I could see people now that I cannot remember their names,” he said.” But I can see the face. And then gradually I’ll start remembering.” Crossing guards say they aren’t just waiting for officials to act to protect them. Many of them have organized on social platforms like TikTok through series like “Crossing Guard Chronicles,” set up by former Atlanta crossing guard Shante Joseph to educate the public about the dangers guards face. Others have joined Facebook groups like the National Association of School Crossing Guards, a platform that allows guards to share experiences and advocate for reform. They are also pushing their employers to provide items they think will make the job safer, such as body cameras, which some have already bought with their own money. The guards said they would also like to see increased police supervision in school zones and license plate recognition systems to help police spot bad drivers. Ultimately, they say they would like to see drivers treat crossing guard safety as seriously as the safety of the children they protect. Still, despite the daily dangers they face, many school crossing guards say they continue to enjoy what they see as an important and much-needed function.

5:25 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump is back in Washington after spending a week in Asia. He attended the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, addressed U.S. troops in Japan and met with China's President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Here are five takeaways from the president's first visit to the region in his second term. 1. U.S.-China trade relations have mostly stabilized … On the flight back to Washington after his meeting with Xi on Thursday, Trump said the tariff rate on Chinese exports would be lowered from 57% to 47%. The 10-point drop comes because Xi committed to trying to decrease the amount of fentanyl coming into the U.S. That issue has been a priority for Trump, who months ago put an extra 20% tariff on China because of fentanyl. Trump also said that China would resume buying soybeans from the U.S., which has been a major issue for American farmers since China had halted those purchases. China also agreed to back off the extra limits it had put on rare earths exports, in exchange for the U.S. scaling back some of its own export restrictions. That agreement will hold for a year. Those minerals are critical for the U.S. and other countries because they are used in military equipment and other technology. 2. But a finalized deal isn't done \"It was an outstanding group of decisions I think that was made,\" Trump told reporters after his meeting with Xi. \"There wasn't too much left out there.\" But he wasn't specific about what exactly is left for China and the U.S. to discuss. Trump said he is scheduled to visit China next April, which will be followed by another meeting with Xi in either Washington or in Florida. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dennis Wilder, a former national security official and a professor at Georgetown University, said the meeting between Trump and Xi gave \"momentum\" for trade talks between the two countries to continue. \"Both sides have not given up their trade weapons but merely have agreed to stop firing as long as both sides hold to the agreements,\" Wilder said. 3. Diplomacy = flattery A charm offensive was on full display in Malaysia, Japan and Korea as leaders tried to cater to Trump ahead of trade talks and other negotiations. Trump's style of foreign relations is often rooted in personal relationships; heads of state, when visiting Washington, have tried to appease Trump to have a smoother relationship with the president. That strategy came forward in Asia, too. Nearly 100 dancers in Malaysia greeted Trump on the red carpet at his first stop. In Japan, Trump was gifted late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's golf clubs and the newly elected prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, announced that she was going to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump's arrival in South Korea was also full of fanfare — \"YMCA,\" a song that's played at Trump's rallies for nearly a decade, was performed on the tarmac in Busan when Air Force One landed. President Lee Jae Myung gave Trump a replica of a golden crown significant to Korea's history. Trump also got a gold medal and was awarded Korea's highest civilian honor. 4. Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker Trump has renamed the Department of Defense as the Department of War, he's deployed National Guard troops around different U.S. cities and in recent weeks, he has ordered strikes on a number of boats in the eastern Pacific allegedly carrying drugs. But on this trip in Asia, Trump wanted to emphasize his role as a peacemaker. His first stop in Malaysia at the ASEAN summit included presiding over the signing of a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand. A border dispute reignited between the two countries earlier this year, and Trump helped broker a ceasefire by threatening to increase tariffs. In his remarks in Kuala Lumpur, Trump said he was in Scotland playing golf when he got on the phone with the leaders from Cambodia and Thailand, and Malaysia, who also helped broker peace. \"You caused me very good entertainment. I could've had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun for me than anything,\" Trump said. Even before the trip, Trump had been claiming his administration has ended eight global conflicts. Russia's war in Ukraine hasn't been one of them, which has frustrated Trump. But it's possible he adds another conflict to solve to his peacemaking list. Though he didn't meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while in Asia, Trump left the door open for a future meeting and said his administration would work on tensions between North and South Korea, which never formally ended their war. 5. Trump's making deals abroad, but Congress is still at a standstill Despite the dealmaking and peacemaking on the world's stage, Trump came home to a federal government that's still shut down, federal workers who aren't getting paid and critical programs like SNAP running out of funding. The president hasn't shown the same interest in making deals across the aisle with Democrats to reopen the government. Instead, he returned to Washington on Thursday night and mused on Truth Social about using the \"nuclear option,\" which he said would be to get rid of the filibuster. That would allow Senate Republicans to pass a funding agreement with a simple majority, not a 60-vote majority that would require support from Democrats. \"We are in power and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying 'SHUT DOWN',\" Trump said, adding that ending the filibuster   would \"take advantage\" of Democrats. Democrats have refused to vote in favor of the agreement to temporarily fund the government unless it includes a measure that would extend the tax credit that lowers the cost of health insurance premiums, which is set to expire at the end of the year. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95838","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:17:00-04:00","title":"Pakistan and Afghanistan Agree to Maintain Ceasefire — for Now","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to maintain a ceasefire after five days of talks in Istanbul, following over a week of intense cross-border gunfire and targeted strikes that killed dozens.

Here's what to know \n         By Betsy Joles \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 3:17 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — After five days of on-and-off talks in Istanbul to resolve hostilities that flared in the first half of October, Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to continue a ceasefire they arrived at earlier this month, Turkey's Foreign Ministry  announced Thursday .  In a statement, the ministry said the next round of talks would take place on Nov. 6: \"All parties have agreed to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and imposing penalty on the violating party.\"   The ceasefire came after more than a week of cross-border gunfire and targeted strikes inside Afghanistan killed dozens on both sides, including civilians. The agreement put a pause on the most intense fighting between the two countries in years. Trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan has ground to a halt as major border crossings remain closed. Analysts warn that the conflict, which has deep roots, could reignite and destabilize the region. Here's what to know. What's at stake? The main issue between the neighboring countries is rising militancy in Pakistan's mountainous borderlands, where the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, has ramped up attacks in the years since the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, following the withdrawal of U.S. forces. The TTP is closely aligned with the Afghan Taliban, and Pakistan accuses Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of providing them a base and failing to rein them in when they orchestrate deadly attacks in Pakistan — all of which Afghanistan's Taliban denies. Each country blamed the other for a breakdown in talks earlier this week. In a post on X, Pakistan's Information Minister Ataullah Tarar  said  Afghanistan's Taliban \"have always remained indifferent to Pakistan's losses. ... Pakistan's patience has run its course.\" Afghan state broadcaster RTA accused Pakistan of \"irrational demands.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Pakistan's increasingly bold military actions inside Afghanistan reflect its hardening stance toward cross-border militant groups, says Muhammad Amir Rana, director of Islamabad's Pak Institute for Peace Studies, an independent think tank. \"This is signaling to the [Afghan] Taliban that if you haven't changed your attitudes or policies supporting the TTP and other terrorist organizations inside Pakistan, Pakistan can retaliate,\" he says. What sparked this month's fighting? The conflict began after TTP militants  ambushed  a Pakistani army convoy on Oct. 8, killing 11 soldiers near the Afghan border. The TTP  aims to overthrow the Pakistani government  and impose hardline Islamic rule, as the Taliban did in Afghanistan. Afghanistan then  blamed Pakistan  for multiple strikes inside its territory on Oct. 9, including in its capital, Kabul. Pakistan has neither officially confirmed nor denied carrying out the strikes. Two nights later, Afghan forces fired at Pakistan's border posts in retaliation, leading to back-and-forth gunfire along the border. Cross-border fighting flared up again days later, before both sides agreed to an initial truce, which was later extended in Doha, Qatar, on Oct. 19.   Before ceasefire talks began in Doha, Pakistan also launched what security officials called targeted strikes against militants in Afghanistan's eastern province of Paktika. Up to now, talks with the Taliban about the TTP have yielded little for Pakistan, analysts say. \"Pakistani attempts to talk to the Taliban to convince them to do something against the TTP have failed,\" says Abdul Basit, senior associate fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Islamabad has also tried to pressure the Taliban by deporting Afghan refugees. Who are the Pakistani Taliban? The TTP emerged in 2007 in response to Pakistan's military support of the U.S. fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan. It has primarily targeted Pakistani security personnel in recent years, but also has claimed responsibility for horrific attacks on civilians, including   one in 2014  that killed more than 100 Pakistani schoolchildren. Its fighters share close ideological ties and battlefield experience with Afghanistan's Taliban. The group has seen a revival in the past four years, after counterterrorism campaigns significantly weakened it around a decade ago.  An independent conflict monitor found the TTP was behind   600 attacks  against Pakistani security forces in the past year alone. That's compared to an estimated   67 attacks  the year before the Taliban took power in Afghanistan, according to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies. Pakistan has been  closely connected to the Taliban  since it cultivated the Afghan group in the 1990s. It was accused of covertly supporting the Taliban through the U.S. war in Afghanistan, something Islamabad denies. How might this play out? President Trump said earlier this week on the sidelines of a regional summit in Malaysia that the conflict would be an easy fix. \"I heard that Pakistan and Afghanistan have started up, but I'll get that solved very quickly,\" he said.  In a post on X, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid  said Thursday  that Afghanistan, \"like other neighboring countries, also desires positive relations with Pakistan and it adheres to the principles of mutual respect, non-interference in internal affairs, and not posing a threat to anyone.\" Earlier this year, Pakistan and Afghanistan held a trilateral meeting with China to discuss issues including counterterrorism and trade, raising hopes of better relations. But ties are meanwhile growing between Afghanistan and India, Pakistan's eastern neighbor and rival.  Asif, Pakistan's defense minister,  said this week  that \"Kabul is a tool for Delhi.\" This month's Pakistan-Afghanistan fighting coincided with the Taliban foreign minister's  first official visit  to India. \"It's not for a lack of diplomacy or dialogue that we are where we are right now,\" says Asfandyar Mir, senior fellow for South Asia at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C. The current ceasefire, he says, suggests that for now, Pakistan has been able to corner the Taliban with its military escalation. But he expects the Taliban to continue tacitly supporting the TTP by stalling on Pakistani requests to act against the group in Afghanistan. He says the Afghan Taliban's support for the TTP is a continued source of regional instability that could lead to more attacks by the group in Pakistan and more intense military action by Pakistan inside Afghanistan. Basit, from Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, puts it starkly: \"Border tensions will play out at a new level,\" he warns. \"If they were simmering, now they will be boiling.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/instacart-doordash-snap-benefits-food-aid-70fced0e93cd14df31cf048aaf7a5b8a","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:24:59+00:00","title":"Major U.S. Delivery Companies Launch SNAP Relief Programs Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to freeze SNAP benefit payments on Nov. 1 due to a government shutdown, major companies including Instacart, DoorDash, Gopuff, and Zip Co. are launching emergency relief programs.

evicted him from his royal residence after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Buckingham Palace said. After the king’s rare move, which follows years of shameful scandals, he will be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and not as a prince, and he will have to vacate his Royal Lodge mansion near Windsor Castle. Demand had been growing on the palace to oust the prince from Royal Lodge after he surrendered his use of the title Duke of York earlier this month over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, whose posthumous memoir hit bookstores last week. But the king went even further to punish him for serious lapses of judgment by removing the title of prince that he has held since birth as a child of a monarch, the late Queen Elizabeth II.

Andrew faced a new round of public outrage after emails emerged earlier this month showing he had remained in contact with Epstein longer than he previously admitted. That news was followed by publication of “Nobody’s Girl,” by Giuffre , who alleged she had sex with Andrew when she was 17. The book detailed three alleged sexual encounters with Andrew, who she said acted as if he believed “having sex with me was his birthright.” Andrew, 65, has long denied Giuffre’s claims , but stepped down from royal duties after a disastrous November 2019 BBC interview in which he attempted to rebut her allegations. Andrew paid millions in an out-of-court settlement in 2022 after Giuffre filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, he acknowledged Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); King couldn’t avoid the controversy Although Charles was involved in discussions with Andrew before he announced he would relinquish his dukedom two weeks ago, the king had largely managed to steer clear of the scandal until this week. After attending an event at Lichfield Cathedral on Monday, the king was heckled by a man who shouted questions about how long he had known about his brother and Epstein and then asked: “Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew?” The king did not respond and it wasn’t clear if he even heard the man, who was shouted down by others and eventually pulled from sight. But video of the incident made the evening news and was the source of embarrassing headlines the next morning. It’s the most dramatic royal departure since 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated the throne so he could marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. The couple were given the titles Duke and Duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in exile outside Britain. Prince Harry, despite renouncing his royal role, feuding with his family and moving to California, remains a prince and the Duke of Sussex. The move by the king means Andrew will no longer be a prince or known as His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, Earl of Inverness or Baron Killyleagh — all titles he held until now.

His star status peaked after he flew missions as a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy during the 1982 Falklands War when British forces sailed to the south Atlantic to eject the Argentine military that had invaded the U.K. overseas territories.

Since 1977, only three other prisoners in the U.S. have been executed by firing squad. All were in Utah, most recently Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010. Bryant’s execution will be the seventh in South Carolina since executions restarted in September 2024. All the others have chosen execution by lethal injection. The state also has an electric chair. Investigators say Bryant terrorized Sumter County in 2004 Bryant admitted to killing Willard “TJ” Tietjen after stopping by his secluded home in rural Sumter County and saying he had car trouble. Tietjen was shot several times. Candles were lit around his body. Someone took a potholder made by his daughter when she was child, dipped the corner in blood and wrote “victem 4 in 2 weeks. catch me if u can” on the wall, authorities said. Tietjen’s daughter called him several times, getting more worried when he didn’t answer. On the sixth call, she testified a strange voice answered and said he had killed Tietjen. Prosecutors said Bryant also killed two men — one before and one after Tietjen. He gave the men rides and when they got out to urinate on the side of lonely, rural roads he shot them in the back. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Bryant’s lawyers said he was troubled in the months before the killing, begging a probation agent and his aunt to get him help because he couldn’t stop thinking about being sexually abused by four male relatives when he was a child. Bryant tried to help himself through the pain by using meth and smoking joints he sprayed with bug killer, his defense attorneys said. A total of 41 men have died by court-ordered execution in the U.S. this year, and at least 18 more are scheduled to be put to death during the remainder of 2025 and next year. Bryant’s death will be the 50th execution in South Carolina since the death penalty was reinstated 40 years ago."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/quakers-worship-noisy-world-philadelphia-pennsylvania-6549d5f4560f9a068bc48a7803216502","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:37:18+00:00","title":"Young People Seeking Solace in Silent Quaker Worship at Arch Street Meeting House in Philadelphia","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Arch Street Meeting House in Philadelphia is experiencing a significant revival in attendance, especially among young adults, as more people seek quiet, reflective spiritual experiences amid a loud and chaotic technological world.

House in Philadelphia’s Old City , more and more young people are seeking respite from a clamorous technological age in the silent worship of a centuries-old faith. Like other Quaker houses of worship, it follows values of simplicity and equality. There’s no clergy, pulpit or altar. No statues of saints, no stained-glass windows. No one sings or chants, burns incense or lights candles. They simply sit in silence in 200-year-old wooden pews — and wait for a message from God to move through them until they speak. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “This feels different in that it’s so simple. It’s set up in a way that makes you feel like your internal world … is equally as important as the space that you’re in,” says Valerie Goodman, a pink-haired artist reading her Bible outside the meeting house on a recent Sunday before going inside. Goodman, 27, grew up Southern Baptist but left the evangelical church in college.

But recent years have produced an unprecedented surge in the number of attendees at Sunday worship — from about 25 before the coronavirus pandemic to up to 100 today. “One of the things that I’m very excited about is the number of people that we have coming to meeting, and the fact that the majority of them are young,” says Hazele Goodridge, Arch Street’s clerk.

Philbrook says she values the faith’s long tradition of Quaker activism that she believes is attracting young people at a time of deep divisions and political violence in America. Historically, Quakers have been involved in peaceful protests to end wars and slavery, and they support women’s voting rights in line with their commitment to justice and peace. Earlier this year, Quakers marched from New York City to Washington to demonstrate against the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants . “In times of national distress, people tend to turn towards something that is historically a peaceful and social justice-oriented faith,” Philbrook says. “They just want a place to sit and reflect and be in a like-minded community.” Benjamin Barger and Emily Philbrook kiss as they walk out of Arch Street Meeting House after their traditional Quaker wedding in Old City Philadelphia on Oct. 3, 2025.

Tourists visiting Independence Hall and other historic Philadelphia attractions would walk into the meeting house’s brick building and were often surprised Quakers even existed, says Goodridge, a member of Arch Street for more than 25 years. “They think, ’Oh, they must have all died out because probably they don’t hear too much about us,” says Goodridge, who is also the first Black clerk in Arch Street’s history. “They think of Quakers as a historic construct, something that used to be around.” Others, she says, would confuse them with Amish or Mennonites or would invoke Quaker Oats, which is unrelated to the faith. The company describes the logo as “a figure of a man in ‘Quaker garb’” with white hair and a tall black hat on its label that the owners picked along with the Quaker name more than 150 years ago “as a symbol of good quality and honest value.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “Quakers didn’t haggle,” Goodridge says. “Quakers were fair businesspeople.

Arch Street, though, has more leeway because it’s a historic site with exterior exhibits that talk about the Quaker faith. That has helped increase visitation. The museum run by Arch Street’s preservation trust has also held organized tours and virtual resources. One of them challenges visitors to test their knowledge of Quakerism with questions painted on a wooden panel.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Roots in 17th-century England The Religious Society of Friends, or the Quakers, originated in 17th-century England. The Christian group was founded by George Fox, who objected to Anglican emphasis on ceremony. In the 1640s, he said he heard a voice that led him to develop a personal relationship with Christ, described as the Inner Light. Fox taught that the Inner Light emancipates a person from adherence to any creed, ecclesiastical authority or ritual forms. Brought to court for opposing the established church, Fox tangled with a judge who derided him as a “quaker” in reference to his agitation over religious matters. In the United States, Quakers became highly influential in cities like Philadelphia and founded colleges in Pennsylvania. But members of the group also faced scorn for refusing to join wars due to their belief in nonviolence. Some were persecuted and even executed for trying to spread their religious beliefs . Today, there are an estimated 400,000 Quakers worldwide. About half live in Africa; most are in Kenya, where they use bands and choirs and evangelize. Arch Street Quakers, though, want to remain traditional. But members credit its outreach clerk, Alec Unkovic, for raising awareness about the often-ignored contributions of Quakers by redesigning the congregation’s site and posting about events on social media. “The stillness in meeting and the way of silence is atypical for our current moment,” says Unkovic, who grew up Catholic. “This meeting made a really conscious choice to acknowledge that many people were interested in this.” On a recent Sunday, Aurora Reardanz sat with dozens of others at Arch Street. After worship, she shared that she had decided to become a full member. Though she was baptized Catholic, Reardanz never practiced. Instead, she found her spiritual home in Quakerism and the faith’s values, known as SPICES — Simplicity, Peace, Integrity, Community, Equality, and Stewardship. Today, she also appreciates silence, calling it “beautiful and alluring.” But it wasn’t always that way. “My first meeting for worship at 15, I thought I was in a cult. I was terrified. The silence was deafening,” she says. “And it’s something that grew on me, and I think it grows on a lot of people, and they learn to appreciate it in a world of constant noise.” ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The deal also suspends U.S. port fees and China’s export controls for one year, offering stability in the short term. However, critics like Senator Chuck Schumer and economists such as Eswar Prasad argue that the agreement fails to address deeper structural issues, such as China’s dominance in manufacturing and unfair trade barriers.

2025-10-30T19:11:32+00:00\n\nBUSAN, South Korea (AP) — Three-digit tariffs are off the table, but import duties on each other are higher than in January. Rare earth materials will flow more smoothly, but China has put in place an export permitting regime that it can tighten or loosen as needed. Port fees will go away, but only for one year. And Beijing is again buying U.S. soybeans after it had abruptly cut off American farmers. After months of posturing, arguing and threatening, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have essentially turned back the clock. While the meeting between the two leaders was hailed by Trump as a “roaring success,” the agreement that came out of it may only serve to undo some of the damages Trump inflicted with his trade war upon his return to the White House. “It is hard to see what major gains the U.S. has made in the bilateral relationship relative to where things stood before Trump took office,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); On the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday denounced the deal out of South Korea as leaving the U.S. as “no better off.” Related Stories Trump efforts to help US coal undercut by export drop during trade war 2 MIN READ Xi and Carney, meeting in South Korea, try to rebuild China-Canada relations 3 MIN READ Nvidia partners with South Korean government, companies to boost AI development 4 MIN READ “If anything, things are worse: Prices have gone up and China has agreed to nothing of substance that will improve trade between our nations,” the Democrat senator said, adding that Trump “started a trade war, created a giant mess for businesses, consumers, and soybean farmers, and then he celebrates for trying to clean up the very mess he created in the first place.” Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.

Washington and Beijing still need to finalize their agreements, a process that always has the potential for fresh disputes. But for now, Xi appears interested in moving past the latest tensions. In an official statement, Xi referred to “recent twists and turns” that “offered some lessons for both sides.” He said they should be “focusing on the benefits of cooperation rather than falling into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Both sides reduce tariffs, resume soybean sales to China Trump fired the first shot in the trade war in February when he imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods over the allegation that Beijing failed to stem the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl. That soared to as much as 145% after China retaliated, but Trump walked it back following market meltdowns. The two sides in May slashed their massive tariffs to 10% on each other, while Washington retained the 20% fentanyl-related tariff, and China its retaliatory tariffs of 10% or 15% on U.S. farm goods. Now, Trump said he has removed one 10% fentanyl tariff in exchange for Beijing’s cooperation in fighting the illicit drug. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said China would also withdraw the retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. A spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Beijing would “adjust accordingly” its countermeasures without giving details. In addition, China has agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of U.S. beans through January, and will buy at least 25 million metric tons annually for next three years, Rollins said on Thursday. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); That compares to China buying 17 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the first eight months of this year but importing zero in September.

On October 9, Beijing expanded the export rules, apparently in response to the U.S. decision to extend export controls to businesses affiliated with already-blacklisted foreign companies. Furious, Trump threatened to impose a new 100% tariff on China, but the two sides managed to cool down in time for Trump to meet Xi in South Korea. Beijing on Thursday said it would pause for a year the rare earth export rules from October to “conduct research to refine specific plans,” while the U.S. will suspend its affiliate rule for one year. The delay by Beijing “provides just enough time for the United States to accelerate investment in capabilities and innovation for rare earths and permanent magnets,” said Wade Senti, president of the U.S. permanent magnet company AML. “This needs to be on warp speed and at a scale never seen before since the COVID-19 response,” he said. Another fresh thorn was the U.S. introduction of port fees in October targeting China-linked vessels, as part of a plan to restore America’s shipbuilding capabilitie s. Beijing answered with countermeasures against the U.S. The port fees on each other are not removed but will be suspended for one year, the Chinese commerce ministry said. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The future is still uncertain Whether Trump accepts a return to the status quo or pushes to address fundamental issues that have persisted for years between the U.S. and China remains unclear. Nothing about Thursday’s meeting — the first between Trump and Xi in six years — affects Chinese manufacturing dominance that Trump has blamed for the loss of American blue collar jobs. !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}(); Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, called the latest developments “very encouraging” and added: “We hope that future negotiations will address long-standing market access barriers, help level the playing field for U.S. companies, and bring long-term predictability to the bilateral trade relationship.” There are more opportunities on the horizon to keep working on these challenges. Trump said he will go to China in April and Xi will visit the U.S. after that. If Trump isn’t successful, this period could be remembered for a lot of sound and fury but no change in the basic trajectory of China’s ascendant economy. “Generally, Trump grows impatient with anything beyond the immediate, and it is the Chinese that play for longer term advantage,” said Kurt Campbell, a former deputy secretary of state in the Biden administration and now chairman of The Asia Group. ___ Tang and Wiseman reported from Washington.

during racial justice protests in 2020, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. In recent weeks, federal law enforcement officials have issued subpoenas and served at least one search warrant as part of an investigation into the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. and other Black-led organizations that helped spark a national reckoning on systemic racism, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss an ongoing criminal probe by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.

Click here to hear Washington Bureau Chief Anna Johnson explain AP’s policy on the use of anonymous sources. It was not clear if the investigation would result in criminal charges, but its mere existence invites fresh scrutiny to a movement that in recent years has faced criticism about its public accounting of donations it has received. The recent burst of investigative activity is also unfolding at a time when civil rights organizations have raised concerns about the potential for the Trump administration to target a variety of progressive and left-leaning groups that have been critical of him, including those affiliated with BLM, the transgender rights movement and anti-ICE protesters. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Spokespeople for the Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.

The foundation said it took in over $90 million in donations following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose last breaths under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer sparked protests across the U.S. and around the world. Critics of the nonprofit foundation, and of the BLM movement broadly, accused organizers of not being transparent about how it was spending the donations. That criticism grew louder after BLM foundation leaders in 2022 confirmed they used donations to purchase a $6 million Los Angeles-area property that includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The leaders previously denied wrongdoing and publicly released tax documents. No prior investigations into the nonprofit’s finances have yielded proof of impropriety. Leaders of the foundation have received subpoenas. In a statement emailed to the AP on Thursday, the foundation said it “is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.” “We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,” the foundation said in the statement. Several localized BLM chapters, which are not affiliates of the foundation, have previously been at odds with the nonprofit over its plans for donations. Those chapters operate and fundraise independently of the foundation. The Black Lives Matter movement first emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida. But it was the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, that made the slogan “Black lives matter” a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Movement founders and organizers pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus of BLM chapters. But as the movement’s influence grew, so did the number of organizations that became affiliated with BLM. In 2020, a tidal wave of public contributions in the aftermath of protests over Floyd’s murder came mainly to the BLM foundation, although other organizations were resourced from those funds. Leaders of the foundation opened up about finances and organizational structure in 2022 , revealing detailed accountings of expenditures.

The top prosecutor there, Bill Essayli, was determined by a federal judge this week to have stayed in his temporary acting U.S. attorney job longer than allowed by law. He was permitted to effectively remain the office’s chief prosecutor but with a different title of First Assistant United States Attorney. Essayli had previously served as a Republican assemblyman in California, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s COVID-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against state policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); As a private practice attorney, he characterized BLM as a “radical organization” while defending a white couple charged in 2020 with a hate crime after they were videotaped defacing a BLM mural in Martinez, California . At the time, city-sanctioned BLM murals had been painted on roadways in cities throughout the U.S. in an expression of solidarity with the racial justice movement. Essayli was quoted as telling reporters that his clients were simply expressing their political viewpoints and that they disagreed with taxpayer funds being used to “sponsor” Black Lives Matter, which he described as a “radical” group. At the height of the Floyd-sparked reckoning on racial injustice, some state officials vowed their own investigations in the foundation’s finances, citing their responsibility to protect residents who may have donated to BLM. But most of those probes were resolved without official action. In 2022, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed a lawsuit against the BLM foundation for failing to comply with an investigation into the organization’s finances. Soon after, a representative of the foundation responded with the necessary information and documentation, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said, and the lawsuit was dismissed. ___ Alana Durkin Richer in Washington, D.C., and Graham Lee Brewer in Oklahoma City contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-afrikaners-refugees-trump-asylum-025bbfc3a252475222e044ea13d1e128","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"17:01:26Z","title":"South Africa Criticizes U.S. Refugee Policy Prioritizing Afrikaners","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, the U.S. government under former President Donald Trump announced a major shift in refugee policy, reducing the annual refugee ceiling to 7,500 and prioritizing Afrikaners—South Africa’s white minority group—based on claims of a 'genocide' in the country.

Vulnerability — not race — should guide humanitarian policy,” they wrote in the widely publicized letter. However, some Afrikaner groups continue to be very critical of the South African government’s handling of crime and redress policies even though they reject the “white genocide” claim.

to cemeteries across Mexico . Here, in the winding canals and farms on the fringes of Mexico City, the flower also known as the Mexican marigold has been farmed for generations, and takes the spotlight every year in the country’s Day of the Dead celebrations . But as 50-year-old Ortiz and other farmers busily bundle clusters of the plant to sell in markets around the capital, they quietly wonder what will be left of their livelihood down the line. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); That’s because cempasuchil growers say they’ve been left reeling by torrential rains, stretching drought and other impacts from climate change — caused by the burning of fuels like gas, oil and coal — that have grown increasingly common.

This year alone, cempasuchil producers said they lost up to half their flower crop from heavy rains and flooding. “This year, we lost a lot. We struggled to even grow the cempasuchil. There were moments in which we didn’t have the money to buy fertilizer we needed,” Ortiz said. “With the cempasuchil plants, we’ve sometimes been left with nothing.” ‘Flower of the dead’ The orange flower has become a symbol of the country’s celebrations that take place every Nov. 1 and 2. Also known as the “flower of the dead”, the cempasuchil is believed to be a point of connection between the worlds of the dead and the living, with bright petals that light the path of dead souls to the altars set out by their family. The flowers are also a crucial economic engine across Mexico, which commerce groups predict will rake in nearly 2.7 million dollars for farmers in 2025. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Ortiz and her family began growing the flower 30 years ago in their small plot of land in Xochimilco, a rural borough in the south of Mexico City where residents have continued to carry on ancient farming techniques using canals that wind through farmlands like a maze.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Every year, locals begin to plant the marigold seeds in July, and grow the plants as the rainy season winds down. But they say that they’ve been dealt a heavy blow for consecutive years as heavy rains, drought, floods and other climate shifts have made it increasingly difficult to keep their crops alive. This year, torrential rains stretching on for months wiped out more than 37,000 acres of crops across the country, according to government figures. In a visit to cempasuchil fields earlier this month in Xochimilco, Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said that as many of 2 million marigold plants were put at risk. Despite that, she said that production this year simultaneously broke a record of 6 million plants as farmers ramp up to meet increasing demand even as growing the flower has become more precarious. Ortiz said the excess of rain has brought on pests, diseases and rotted the roots of her plants. She estimates she lost at least 30% of her crop, while others say they’ve lost closer to 50%. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The family has been forced to drop money on insecticides, fertilizer and more to save their crops. As they have, razor thin profit margins have turned into losses, and they’ve had to cut back on basics like beef and sweets to make ends meet. “If I were to take a hard look at all our losses, I’d be incredibly disillusioned and even not want to grow them anymore,” she said. “We’re just trying to push forward and make sure this keeps going on.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Adapting to climate change Just down the road from Ortiz’s farm, government scientists are searching for long-term solutions beyond the short-term economic relief provided by the local government. In a small seed bank known as Toxinachcal, men in white suits meticulously pick through sprouts in a lab dish. The scientists have been at work for a year and a half saving up thousands of seed variants of native plant species, including 20 variants of cempasuchil, in jars lining giant freezers in the hopes that the storage facility will be a key tool in fighting the most adverse effects of climate change. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Biologist Clara Soto Cortés, head of the seed bank, said part of the reason that the crop has been devastated is because farmers in recent years have elected to use a hybrid marigold seed variant from the United States.

But that means farmers have turned away from sturdier, native breeds, which have longer stocks and widely vary in color, size and texture. The genetic diversity of these Mexican breeds makes them more resilient to drastic climate shifts like the ones seen this year, Soto said. “These native seeds have adapted to different geographies, in high altitudes and low, in places where there’s a lot of rain or there’s none at all, or where they need to be resistant to insects,” she said. “The (hybrid) seeds have been bred for another purpose. It doesn’t have the genetic diversity needed to take on climate change.” If more climate events, like the floods that roiled producers wipe out an entire crop, Soto said the bank will make seeds available to local producers to recover their crops – this time with a more resilient variant that their ancestors have been farming for centuries. Carrying on an ancient tradition Meanwhile, growers are scrambling to bounce back in the short term, saying the losses also represent a threat to the farming tradition their families have struggled to maintain on the edge of the dense city of 23 million people. Carlos Jiménez, 61, has long worked the fields of Xochimilco, but began to grow the shorter marigold plants eight years ago when he noticed the hybrid was more marketable. As he’s lost more crops and gotten lower prices for the plants because of the mildew gathering at their roots, he said he’s begun considering ways to adapt, like building greenhouses. “The plants get sick, they rot, and our business is snuffed out,” Jiménez said. “And with it goes our tradition because it’s our economy.” Flor Jimenez waters her crop of cempasuchil flowers in preparation for Day of the Dead celebrations in Xochimilco where marigolds are grown on the outskirts of Mexico City, Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025.

But their losses mean they have no money to build added infrastructure. Her family and other farmers have called on local authorities for help, but say they’ve received just pennies on the dollar of what they need to bounce back. Though the local government has said it continues to work to help offset the blow felt by farmers. She said she’s begun to look at other crops she might be able to farm that are more resilient than the crinkled orange flowers. Others like Jiménez said that while the roots of plants may rot around him, for now he’s holding strong. “This plant has a deeper meaning to our lost loved ones,” he said. “These are traditions we carry down from our ancestors.

And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/tropical-storm-melissa-takes-aim-at-caribbean-islands-on-alert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:29:43+00:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa takes aim at Caribbean, islands on alert","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season in the Caribbean, is threatening the region with extreme rainfall, flooding, and landslides.

2025-10-23T08:09:33+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/jamaica-braces-as-hurricane-melissa-strengthens-offshore","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"06:45:50+00:00","title":"Officials warn Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm with sustained winds over 250km/h and moving at just 7km/h, is forecast to make landfall on Jamaica’s southwestern coast, threatening catastrophic flooding, landslides, and storm surges.

Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/jamaica-declares-disaster-after-monstrous-melissa-ravages-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:27:00+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, devastated the Caribbean, killing at least 32 people across Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic.

killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica\n\nHurricane Melissa is pummeling the Caribbean island of Cuba after it first caused devastation in Haiti and Jamaica, leading to the deaths of at least 32 people.\n\nTwenty of the reported deaths on Wednesday came after a river burst its banks in the southern coastal Haitian town of Petit-Goave, flooding and collapsing dozens of homes.\n\nThe mayor of the town, Jean Bertrand Subreme, said that people were still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other deaths were reported from Melissa in Haiti. Eight people were killed in Jamaica, including a baby killed after a tree fell in the western side of the island, according to State Minister Abka Fitz-Henley. One person was also reported to have been killed in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs it crossed Cuba on Wednesday, it weakened to a Category 2 storm from its previous Category 5 classification. It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

in the town of Goleta, Aubrie Lugo, a local volunteer, walked down a suburban sidewalk with a stack of flyers.\n\nIt was her first time knocking on doors for a political campaign, but she said she felt compelled to get involved in the fight to pass a statewide measure known as Proposition 50.\n\n“It feels like a dire situation,” Lugo said, as she eyed houses festooned with Halloween decorations. “We’re trying to fight the rigging of our democracy.”\n\nProposition 50 is a measure on the November 4 ballot in California, but its success or failure will have implications for elections beyond 2025.\n\nThe measure gives California voters a choice: whether or not to adopt a congressional map designed to net the Democratic Party five additional seats in the United States House of Representatives.\n\nProponents say the move is necessary to counteract similar Republican efforts elsewhere in the country. Opponents argue that Proposition 50 would strip California Republicans of their voice in Congress.\n\nBoth sides have framed their campaigns as a fight to uphold democracy and ensure fair representation.\n\nThe outcome of Tuesday’s vote is likely to weigh heavily on the 2026 midterm elections, where control of the House of Representatives is up for grabs.\n\nPresident Trump’s Republican Party currently holds a slim majority in the chamber, and next year’s midterms are likely to serve as a referendum on his second term in the White House.\n\nTo help keep control of the House majority, Trump himself has successfully pushed for partisan maps to be drawn in Republican strongholds like Texas.\n\nDesigned as a response, the California ballot initiative has already generated widespread attention, pulling national figures into the state’s fight. Trump has berated the vote as “dishonest”, while his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, hailed its importance.\n\n“This vote will have critical implications,” Obama said in a social media post in support of the measure. “Not just for California, but for our entire country.”\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom first announced that Proposition 50 would go before voters in mid-August, arguing that Democrats could not afford to “unilaterally disarm” while Republican states pursue partisan congressional districts.\n\n“We’re asking the voters for their consent to do midterm redistricting in 2026, 2028 and 2030 for the congressional maps, to respond to what’s happening in Texas,” Newsom said.\n\nTexas was the inspiration for Proposition 50. In June, reports emerged that the Trump administration was quietly pressuring politicians in the southern state to revamp their congressional districts ahead of the pivotal 2026 midterm elections.\n\nEach district elects its own representative to Congress. And in the House of Representatives, the margins are so tight that a handful of votes could buoy or doom a bill.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a narrow majority of 219 seats, just six more than the Democrats.\n\nFearing Democratic gains in the midterms, the Republican-led Texas legislature ultimately passed a new congressional map that was drawn to disadvantage Democratic voters and gain Republican seats.\n\nRed-leaning states, including North Carolina and Missouri, have also moved forward with their own such efforts.\n\nMany see California’s ballot measure as a test of whether Democrats are willing to counter Trump’s efforts to reshape the electoral landscape, even if it means adopting methods they might otherwise oppose.\n\n“If the Democratic states don’t respond to what Texas did, all of the other Republican states are going to do the same thing,” said Doug Allard, a 77-year-old Goleta resident who voted in favour.\n\nIn California, however, the state legislature cannot simply vote on a new congressional map.\n\nThat’s because, in the 2010 election, California voters assigned that task to a nonpartisan group called the Citizens Redistricting Commission, which draws maps with an eye for proportional representation.\n\nNovember’s ballot measure would not eliminate the commission. But it would suspend its activities until 2030 and replace its existing map with a new version drawn by the legislature.\n\nThe result would be far fewer California Republicans elected to Congress.\n\n“California had nine districts in the last election decided by a margin of less than seven points,” Samuel Wang, the director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, told Al Jazeera. “Our estimate is that, if Prop 50 passes, there will only be one district that is that close.”\n\nThe campaign in favour of Prop 50 has stressed the temporary nature of the change: The nonpartisan commission would resume its work in five years.\n\nNewsom has also said that California will abandon the measure if Texas does the same with its partisan map.\n\nProponents also point out that California voters will get the chance to decide whether to adopt the new legislative map or not, something Texas voters did not do.\n\nThose caveats are seen as important for attracting California voters who might normally see gerrymandering — the practice of drawing districts in a partisan way — as anti-democratic. California had previously touted the nonpartisan commission as an example of fair redistricting.\n\nAdvertising campaigns, featuring national figures like Obama and US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have also sought to allay fears, positioning Proposition 50 as a necessary bulwark against a Republican power grab.\n\n“Prop 50 levels the playing field and gives power back to the people,” Ocasio-Cortez said, framing the vote as a part of a “fight for democracy in all 50 states”.\n\nBut opponents fear the ballot measure would empower state and national politicians to manipulate voting districts to secure majorities at the expense of individual voters.\n\nExperts like Wang also see California voters facing a trade-off: The measure embodies a tension between safeguarding fair representation at the local level versus the federal level.\n\n“The argument is that it is of no use to have a fairly elected representative from your district if the deck is stacked against the policies you favour at a national level,” Wang said.\n\nHe observed that many of the discussions surrounding Proposition 50 hinge on issues of national politics, with supporters largely united in opposition against Trump’s policies.\n\n“It appears to me that voters are looking at this through a national lens,” said Wang.\n\nSome critics have also expressed concern over the risks of ever-escalating, tit-for-tat tactics between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nFormer California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican long involved in anti-gerrymandering efforts, is among the most prominent voices urging voters to reject Proposition 50.\n\n“There’s this war going on all over the United States. Who can out-cheat the other one?” Arnold Schwarzenegger said during a recent TV interview.\n\n“Texas started it. They did something terribly wrong. And then all of a sudden, California says, ‘Well, then we have to do something terribly wrong.’ And then now other states are jumping in.”\n\nOne path to help de-escalate the redistricting fight could be to pass nonpartisan reforms at the national level, according to Wang. Such reforms would prevent individual states from drawing maps in a way that slants the odds in favour of one party or another.\n\n“There is abundant evidence that independent commissions draw fairer maps than legislatures do,” Wang said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have previously introduced legislation that would have made nonpartisan redistricting a national practice, but those efforts failed to attract Republican support. Rising tensions could make such an effort even less likely in the current political environment.\n\nEarlier this week, the Trump administration said that it would dispatch federal officials to California to “monitor” the November 4 election for irregularities. Newsom called the announcement an act of voter intimidation meant to dampen the turnout and cast doubt on the results.\n\nTrump has a long history of aggressively promoting conspiracy theories about “rigged” elections, particularly with regard to his own loss in the 2020 presidential race. That rhetoric was used to justify a series of aggressive efforts to cast out the election results.\n\nVoters like Hank, a 77-year-old California resident who asked that his last name not be used, cited the Trump administration’s actions as their reason for voting “yes” on Prop 50.\n\n“We can’t allow the current trend to dominate. Other states are gerrymandering, and our country is in too much of a crisis,” said Hank. “My concern is on a national level.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/death-toll-from-hurricane-melissa-climbs-to-49-with-many-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:15:49+00:00","title":"Death toll from Hurricane Melissa climbs to 49, with many still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, made landfall in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane, causing catastrophic damage, widespread flooding, and a death toll that has risen to 49.

in parts of Hue and Hoi An.\n\nVietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said the volume of rainfall in Hue marked the highest ever for a 24-hour period since the country started its record-keeping.\n\nThe newspaper VNExpress reported that water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers, which flow through Hue, reached 5.25m (17.2 ft) on Monday afternoon, shattering the previous historical high recorded in 2020.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, water levels from both rivers have receded, but Hue remains submerged by more than one metre (3.3ft) of water.\n\nImages showed a wide area of the ancient city, including the palace grounds, under murky waters.\n\nAuthorities in Hue were quoted by the state news agency Vietnam News as saying that the rain and flooding may last until Friday.\n\nThe area was designated a world heritage site in 1993 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nThe heavy rain also triggered a massive landslide of red mud on Tuesday morning about 3km (1.9 miles) long in coastal Quang Ngai province, leaving about 1,700 people isolated, authorities said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, more than 8,600 people in four central provinces were evacuated due to risks from severe flooding and landslides.\n\nHeavy flooding has also forced the state-run Vietnam Railways Corp to suspend services between the capital Hanoi and the business hub Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe government said in a separate report that more than 306,000 households and businesses in Hue, Danang and Quang Tri provinces were suffering from blackouts.\n\nScientists warn that storms are becoming increasingly powerful as the planet warms due to human-induced climate change.\n\nThis month’s rainfall comes after  Typhoon Bualoi  battered the country in September, leaving at least 13 people dead and 20 others missing.\n\nAccording to the General Statistics Office, natural disasters — mostly storms, floods and landslides — left 187 people dead or missing in the country in the first nine months of 2025, with total economic losses estimated at more than $610m."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/jamaica-haiti-and-cuba-take-stock-after-hurricane-melissa-destruction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:33:17+00:00","title":"Jamaica,

as dozens of deaths are reported in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.\n\nThe hurricane – at Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-caused-amazons-aws-outage-and-why-did-so-many-major-apps-go-offline","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:23:04+00:00","title":"What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major AWS outage that began at 07:11 GMT on October 20, 2025, disrupted over 113 services, including major apps like Snapchat, WhatsApp, Roblox, Fortnite, and financial platforms such as Venmo and Coinbase.

did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mosquitoes have been confirmed in Iceland for the first time in over 40 years, following record-breaking heat and glacial melting.

Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/guinea-bissau-arrests-senior-army-officers-for-alleged-coup-attempt","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:18:53Z","title":"Guinea-Bissau arrests senior army officers for alleged coup attempt","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Guinea-Bissau, senior army officers, including Brigadier General Dahaba Nawalna, Commander Domingos Nhanke, and Commander Mario Midana, have been arrested on charges of attempting a coup just before the start of the general election campaign on November 23, 2025.

intensifies, threatening major Caribbean flooding\n\nTropical Storm Melissa has strengthened into a  hurricane , the United States-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) says, as people across several Caribbean countries braced for heavy rainfall and dangerous flooding.\n\nHurricane Melissa was located about 380km (235 miles) southwest of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour, the NHC said in its latest advisory on Saturday afternoon.\n\nA hurricane warning was in place for Jamaica as the NHC said life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and landslides were expected in portions of southern Hispaniola island – shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic – and Jamaica into early next week.\n\nThe centre of Melissa was expected to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend and early next week, the NHC said, adding that it could be near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.\n\nA hurricane watch was also in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, from Port-au-Prince to the border with the Dominican Republic, according to the NHC advisory.\n\nAlready, three people have died in Haiti, including two killed in a landslide in the capital Port-au-Prince and another struck by a falling tree in Marigot, officials said.\n\nA fourth person was killed in the Dominican Republic, where another remains missing.\n\nJamaica’s Meteorological Service principal director Evan Thompson told The Gleaner that residents should brace for a “double effect” as the hurricane’s eye passes over the island, with the strongest winds hitting from opposite directions on either side of the centre.\n\nThe forecast marks a significant shift from earlier in the week, when landfall was considered only a “slim chance”.\n\nAuthorities have readied more than 650 emergency shelters across Jamaica and said airports will close once a hurricane warning is declared. Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned the public to treat the approaching storm as a serious threat. “Take all measures to protect yourself,” he said.\n\nThe storm has already wrought havoc in the Dominican Republic, where nearly 200 homes have been damaged and more than half a million people left without water.\n\nIn the Los Rios neighbourhood of the capital, Santo Domingo, families were forced to flee rising floodwaters on Thursday evening after surrounding streams burst their banks, according to the Listin Diario daily newspaper.\n\nMore than two dozen Dominican communities remain cut off by floodwaters, prompting mandatory evacuations and nationwide school closures.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for thousands displaced by gang violence in Port-au-Prince, now living in makeshift shelters with scant protection.\n\n“I’m dealing with two storms: the gangs and the weather,” Nephtali Johnson Pierre told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nMelissa is also forecast to strike eastern Cuba as a major hurricane on Wednesday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1346","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"23:44:44+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,346","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As of November 1, 2025, Ukrainian forces have launched attacks on 160 Russian oil and energy facilities this year, as reported by SBU head Vasyl Maliuk.

bodies of Palestinians who were detained by Israel have been returned to the besieged Gaza Strip, some showing signs of torture.\n\nThe return of the Palestinian remains, via the International Committee of the Red Cross, came as Israeli forces continued air strikes across the Strip despite a shaky ceasefire, killing at least three people on Friday.\n\nOne Palestinian was killed and his brother wounded by Israeli gunfire in the Shujayea neighbourhood of eastern Gaza City, while another was killed by Israeli shelling in the Jabalia refugee camp, Wafa news agency reported. A third Palestinian died of wounds sustained from previous Israeli shelling, it added.\n\nSeparately, civil defence workers in central Gaza said they had recovered the body of a Palestinian from the rubble of the Abu Medein family home in the az-Zahra neighbourhood.\n\nIsraeli warplanes also struck buildings in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Friday.\n\nThe return of slain Palestinian detainees comes as part of the prisoner-captive exchange deal agreed in early October. The latest handover brings the total number of bodies received to 225, the Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt said medical teams are identifying the bodies under standard protocols before documenting them and notifying families.\n\nIn the previous handovers, bodies of prisoners had exhibited signs of torture, including being blindfolded and handcuffed, medical sources said. Many had appeared decomposed or burned, while others were missing limbs or teeth.\n\nIsrael holds thousands of Palestinians in prison, many in administrative detention without filing official charges against them. Reports that Israel tortures Palestinian detainees in its jails have been common for years, and have increased since the start of its war on Gaza.\n\nUnder the United States-brokered accord to halt Israel’s two-year war on Gaza, Hamas released 20 living captives in exchange for Israel releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian political prisoners. Israeli forces have also completed a partial withdrawal from urban centres in Gaza.\n\nBut since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, Israeli attacks have  killed dozens of Palestinians  across the enclave. From Tuesday into Wednesday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said Israeli attacks killed 104 people, including 46 children and 20 women.\n\nThe Red Cross said it transferred the unidentified remains of three people to Israel late on Friday, but it was unclear if they were deceased captives.\n\nAn Israeli military source told news agency AFP the bodies had been transferred to a “forensic research laboratory” to confirm their identities.\n\nThe previous day, Hamas handed over  two bodies of dead Israeli captives . So far, the group has returned the remains of 17 captives, not including Friday’s three bodies.\n\nAs part of the deal, the Palestinian group committed to returning the remains of all 28 captives in exchange for the bodies of Palestinians killed in the war.\n\nThe group is continuing to press for proper equipment and support to comb through vast mounds of rubble and debris – where thousands of Palestinians killed in Israeli bombardments are still buried.\n\nThe Red Cross and members of Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, travelled to east Khan Younis on Friday to search for the remains of Israeli captives, sources in the armed group told Al Jazeera.\n\nAs Hamas appears to be committed to the ceasefire agreement, Israel has still refused to open vital border crossings and allow much-needed humanitarian aid trucks into the enclave, where famine in the north was declared earlier this year.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from az-Zawayda in central Gaza, said that, while Israel has allowed a new wave of aid trucks to access Gaza on Friday, “humanitarian aid trucks remain partially restricted”.\n\nPalestinians are “really struggling to get aid from the UN warehouses”, he said.\n\n“The situation is still very [difficult] and for many Palestinians, the ceasefire is not only about bringing food in but also about ensuring that shelter materials can [reach] people in need.”\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan announced that various foreign ministers will meet and discuss the Gaza ceasefire and its next steps on Monday.\n\nDuring a news conference in Ankara, Fidan said the meeting would include officials who had met US President Donald Trump in New York in September, and added that the discussions were continuing on forming a Gaza task force and a stabilisation force.\n\nHe added that Turkiye was concerned about whether the ceasefire would continue.\n\nYossi Beilin, Israel’s former justice and foreign minister, said he “would be surprised” if Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reversed course on the ceasefire, despite signs that it has come under increasing strain.\n\n“This is something that he committed himself to, mainly to President Trump, and I would be very surprised if he doesn’t go on with the agreement,” Beilin told Al Jazeera.\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli army’s top lawyer, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, has been dismissed over a video which was leaked last year showing a Palestinian detainee at Sde Teiman detention facility allegedly being sexually assaulted by Israeli troops.\n\nThe facility has been widely criticised for rights abuses. Rights groups say Palestinians have faced severe mistreatment in Israeli detention during the war. The Israeli military says it is investigating dozens of cases but denies systematic abuse, though such probes have often ended without accountability."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067258","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/trump-places-nigeria-on-watch-list-over-claims-of-anti-christian-violence","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"23:28:47Z","title":"Trump places Nigeria on watch list over claims of anti-Christian violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced that Nigeria would be placed on the U.S. Department of State's 'Countries of Particular Concern' list, citing alleged mass killings of Christians by radical Muslims.

that Nigeria will be placed on a watchlist for religious freedom, based on  vague claims  that Christians in the country are being “slaughtered” by Muslims.\n\nIn a social media  post  on Friday, Trump explained that the African nation would be added to a Department of State list of “Countries of Particular Concern”.\n\n“Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,” Trump wrote. “Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a ‘COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN’.”\n\nThe Nigerian government has denied such allegations in the past. But critics warn that designating Nigeria a “country of particular concern” could pave the way for future sanctions.\n\nTrump also appears to have bypassed the normal procedure for such matters.\n\nThe 1998 International Religious Freedom Act created the category of “country of particular concern” in order to help monitor religious persecution and advocate for its end.\n\nBut that label is usually assigned at the recommendation of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom – a bipartisan group established by Congress – and specialists in the State Department.\n\nIn Friday’s post, Trump explained that he had asked the House Appropriations Committee and two congressmen, Representatives Riley Moore and Tom Cole, to “immediately look into this matter”. Both are Republican.\n\nTrump’s claims appear to mirror language pushed by right-wing lawmakers, which frames fractious and sometimes violent disputes in  Nigeria  as a case of radical Islamists attacking Christians.\n\nExperts, however, have called that framing largely inaccurate, explaining that strife in the country is not explained simply by religious differences.\n\nNigeria is divided between a majority-Muslim north and a largely Christian south. The country has struggled with violent attacks from the group Boko Haram, which has created turmoil and  displacement  for more than a decade.\n\nDisputes over resources such as water have also exacerbated tensions and sometimes led to  violent clashes  between largely Christian farmers and largely Muslim shepherds. Nigeria has denied, however, that such clashes are primarily motivated by religious affiliation.\n\nStill, Representative Moore echoed Trump’s assessment in a statement after Friday’s announcement.\n\n“I have been calling for this designation since my first floor speech in April, where I highlighted the plight of Christians in Muslim majority countries,” Moore  said .\n\nHe added that he planned to “ensure that Nigeria receives the international attention, pressure, and accountability it urgently needs”.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas, another Republican, also applauded Trump’s decision. “I am deeply gratified to President Trump for making this determination,” he said in a news release. “I have fought for years to counter the slaughter and persecution of Christians in Nigeria.”\n\nSince returning to office for a second term in January, Trump has sought to bolster his base among the Christian right in the US.\n\nAt a prayer breakfast in February, he  announced  his administration was establishing a task force to root out anti-Christian bias in the federal government.\n\nLater, in July, his administration  issued a memo  allowing federal employees to evangelise in their workplaces.\n\nWhile Trump denounced alleged anti-Christian violence in Friday’s post, his administration has also been recently criticised for its policy towards refugees: people fleeing persecution or violence in their homelands.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced the  lowest-ever cap  on refugee admissions in the US, limiting entry to just 7,500 people for all of fiscal year 2026.\n\nIn a notice posted to the Federal Register’s website, he explained that most of those spots would “primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa” and “other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination”.\n\nCritics were quick to point out that refugee status is awarded for fear of systematic persecution, not discrimination.\n\nStill, Trump has continued to ratchet up diplomatic tensions with South Africa, falsely claiming that white Afrikaners are subjected to a “genocide”, an allegation frequently pushed by figures on the far right."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067270","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24Z","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' discusses a major hurricane making landfall in Jamaica, referred to as a 'storm of the century,' though the article is noted as having been closed and no detailed content is available for extraction.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590264","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-04:00","title":"The best new albums out Oct. 31","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights the best new music releases on October 31, 2025, celebrating Halloween-themed and seasonal music.

alleging that they have spied for Israel or had links to an Israeli air strike that killed the prime minister, according to officials.\n\nAbdulwahid Abu Ras, Yemen’s acting foreign minister, told the Reuters news agency on Friday that a cell within the UN’s World Food Programme was involved in directly targeting the government.\n\nThe Houthi prime minister and nine other ministers were killed in an Israeli strike on the capital Sanaa in August, the first such attack to kill senior officials.\n\nThe UN, which has repeatedly rejected Houthi accusations, said on Friday that a total of 36 UN employees were arrested after Israel’s attack. It says that at least 59 UN personnel are being held by the group.\n\nAbu Ras told Reuters that security agencies were acting “under full judicial supervision” and that public prosecutors were being kept informed “step by step”. It was certain, he said, that the process would lead “to trials and the issuance of judicial rulings”.\n\nSeparately, Nasruddin Amer, a senior Houthi official, told the dpa news agency on Friday that the detained UN workers would be tried on charges of spying for Israel.\n\n“The judiciary will determine the penalty for those accused of spying for Israel in accordance with Yemeni law,” Amer said. “This is not a law we enacted. It is a law that has been in effect and applied in the country by previous regimes.”\n\nThe UN defendants are Yemenis and could face the death penalty under the nation’s laws.\n\nHundreds of UN personnel, including a small number of international staff, remain in parts of Houthi-controlled Yemen, according to Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary general.\n\nHouthi security forces entered several UN offices in Sanaa on Sunday. The UN says it is operating under increasingly difficult conditions, hindering its ability to provide assistance to those in need in Yemen.\n\nAmer told dpa: “The trial is not against the organisations, but against those who exploited humanitarian work to carry out espionage against our country and our people.”\n\nAbu Ras claimed that the Houthis are supporting humanitarian provision, and will “assist organisations committed to the principles of humanitarian work, facilitating their activities and work”.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the World Food Programme.\n\nSince Israel launched its  war on Gaza  in October 2023, the Houthis have targeted vessels in the Red Sea and carried out drone and missile attacks against Israel, saying that they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians under fire in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has regularly struck the war-torn country, targeting civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings and the main international airport, while killing dozens at a time.\n\nLast month, Israeli strikes on Sanaa and the northern province of  al-Jawf  killed dozens of people, including journalists and children."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/war-in-sudan-october-round-up","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"19:00:51Z","title":"War in Sudan: Humanitarian, fighting, control developments, October 2025","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Sudan civil war between the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues into its third year, with both sides accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, particularly in Darfur.

that the administration of President Donald Trump cannot suspend  food assistance  to low-income individuals, signalling that the government must draw from contingency funds as a government shutdown drags on.\n\nFriday’s decisions were released within minutes of one another, and both concerned the fate of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.\n\nAbout 42 million people — or one in eight US citizens — rely on SNAP to feed their households. That assistance was set to come to a halt on Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that, since Congress failed to pass a budget bill in September, it can no longer fund the programme, nor can it use contingency funds to make up the shortfall.\n\nBut both of Friday’s rulings called that logic into question.\n\nThe first decision came from US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston, who gave the Trump administration a Monday deadline to address how it could fund SNAP, at least partially. It was “unlawful”, she wrote, to suspend the programme entirely.\n\nShe also ruled that it was indeed legal to draw from government contingency funds to pay for SNAP, as the government has done in the past.\n\n“Defendants’ suspension of SNAP payments was based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments,” Indira wrote.\n\n“This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program.”\n\nHer decision came in response to a petition from 25 Democrat-led states and the District of Columbia, which argued that the federal government did not have the authority to totally suspend the food assistance.\n\nThe second ruling came from the Rhode Island court of US District Judge John McConnell.\n\nA group of cities, nonprofits and a labour organisation had challenged Trump’s pause on SNAP benefits there. In response, McConnell came to a similar conclusion as his colleague in Boston.\n\n“There is no doubt and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn’t already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food, for their family,” McConnell said during a virtual hearing.\n\nHe called for SNAP funding to continue, using the government contingency funds, and asked for an update from the administration on Monday.\n\nA few hours after the decisions were rendered, Trump  issued a  response  on his Truth Social platform. He reiterated his administration’s position that accessing contingency funds was not legal.\n\n“Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do,” Trump wrote.\n\n“I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT. Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.”\n\nNever before has SNAP been suspended, as has been threatened under the Trump administration.\n\nPlaintiffs in both cases argued that the Trump administration’s actions appeared to be an effort to use food aid as a form of political leverage against Democrats.\n\nThey also pointed out that, prior to  the shutdown , the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said it would tap into emergency funds to maintain SNAP benefits should the Congress fail to pass a funding bill.\n\nBut on October 26, the Trump administration then reversed course, posting a message to the USDA website.\n\n“Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the message read. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.”\n\nThe USDA has at least $5.25bn in contingency funds that it can use to continue disbursing benefits, previously allocated by Congress for use when “necessary to carry out program operations”.\n\nWhile previous government shutdowns have caused interruptions and delays in government services, the Trump administration has pledged to use the situation to slash government employment and programmes it views unfavourably.\n\nThe shutdown is currently in its 31st day. Democrats and Republicans remain at loggerheads over the passage of a budget bill to keep the federal government open.\n\nDemocrats seek to ensure healthcare concerns are addressed in the legislation, while Republicans have refused to negotiate on the issue until a continuing resolution, keeping federal spending at its status quo, is passed.\n\nTop Trump officials on Friday continued to maintain that they could not legally touch the SNAP contingency funds.\n\n“By law, contingency funds can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing,” Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins told reporters.\n\nBut Democrats have applauded the rulings and criticised Trump for his threats. “The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so,” Senator Amy Klobuchar said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/tunisia-sentences-lawyer-and-saied-critic-to-five-years-in-prison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"21:03:36+00:00","title":"Tunisia sentences lawyer and Saied critic to five years in prison","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Tunisian court has sentenced lawyer Ahmed Souab, a vocal critic of President Kais Saied, to five years in prison and an additional three years of administrative supervision after a trial that lasted only seven minutes, with no closing arguments or defence pleas.

The prosecution of Souab and others under Decree Law 54—allegedly used to criminalize dissent and 'fake news'—has raised alarms among rights groups, who argue it marks a deepening crackdown on civil liberties. This is part of a broader pattern of repression, including the suspension of independent media outlet Nawaat and other civil society organizations, which authorities claim is justified by financial audits but critics say is a cover for silencing dissent. The appeal hearing on November 17 is expected to test the legality and fairness of these proceedings, potentially setting a precedent for future judicial actions in Tunisia.","keyTakeAways":["Ahmed

Ahmed Souab, a lawyer and fierce critic of President Kais Saied, to five years in prison, his lawyer said, in a case that rights groups say marks a deepening crackdown on dissent in the North African country.\n\nDefence lawyer Yosr Hamid said on Friday that her client had received an additional three-year sentence of “administrative supervision” after he was  arrested in April  following criticism of the legal process in a trial of prominent figures, including opposition leaders.\n\nSouab’s trial on “anti-terror” charges lasted just seven minutes, according to Hamid, who voiced fears it sets a troubling legal precedent.\n\nHundreds of opposition figures, lawyers, journalists, trade unionists and humanitarian workers in Tunisia are being prosecuted for “conspiracy” or in connection with a “fake news” decree by authorities.\n\nThat legislation, Decree Law 54, has been criticised by rights activists, who are concerned over its broad interpretation by some courts.\n\nSouab, 68, was not allowed to appear in court on Friday, declining to testify via videolink, according to Hamid. His legal team refused to enter a plea under the conditions.\n\nSouab faces around a dozen charges related to the presidential decree on false information.\n\n“The hearing lasted only seven minutes” before the judge retired to deliberate, Hamid told the AFP news agency on Friday.\n\nHe said there was a “lack of fundamental grounds for a fair trial” and that the decision to sentence after a one-day trial set “a precedent”.\n\nMongi Souab, the defendant’s brother, said authorities “prevented family members from entering” the court, criticising the brevity of the trial.\n\nSouab was arrested in April after criticising the trial process for about 40 prominent figures, including opposition leaders, in a case related to “conspiracy against state security”.\n\nAmong those targeted in that case are figures from what was once the biggest party, Ennahdha, such as the leader and former Speaker of Parliament  Rached Ghannouchi , former Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, former Minister of Justice Noureddine Bhiri, and Said Ferjani, a member of the party’s political executive.\n\nSouab was one of the principal defence lawyers.\n\nAfter a trial involving just three hearings, without closing arguments or defence pleas, Souab accused authorities of putting “a knife to the throat of the judge who was to deliver the verdict”.\n\nAn anti-terrorism court interpreted the comment as a threat to the judges, and he was detained over it, but Souab’s lawyers said it was a reference to the huge political pressure on judges.\n\nHeavy prison sentences of up to 74 years were handed down to those accused in the “conspiracy” mega-trial. The appeal related to that trial is scheduled to take place on November 17.\n\nSeveral dozen people demonstrated outside the court on Friday, brandishing photos of Souab and chanting that the country was “under repression and tyranny”.\n\nSeveral Tunisian and foreign NGOs have decried a rollback of rights and freedoms since Saied seized full powers in 2021 in what critics have called a coup.\n\nSeparately on Friday, Tunisian authorities ordered the suspension of the Nawaat journalists’ group, which runs one of the country’s leading independent investigative media outlets, as part of a widening crackdown.\n\nThe one-month suspension follows similar actions against prominent civil society groups such as the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights and the Association of Democratic Women, both known for defending civil liberties.\n\nAuthorities cited financial audits linked to foreign funding as justification, but rights advocates said the real aim was to silence dissenting voices.\n\nThe National Union of Tunisian Journalists condemned the suspension as “a dangerous escalation in efforts to muzzle independent journalism under an administrative guise”.\n\nFounded in 2004, Nawaat carried out investigations on corruption and human rights abuses before and after the revolution. In a statement, it said it would not be “intimidated by the current political climate or campaigns of defamation”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/lawsuit-alleges-horrific-conditions-at-us-immigration-facility-in-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:48:47+00:00","title":"Lawsuit alleges ‘horrific’ conditions at US immigration facility in Chicago","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A class-action lawsuit filed by two long-term Mexican immigrants, Pablo Moreno Gonzalez and Felipe Agustin Zamacona, alleges horrific and unlawful conditions at the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, which has become overwhelmed due to Operation Midway Blitz.

immigrants detained in Chicago, Illinois, have filed a class-action lawsuit against top officials at the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), alleging that they were denied access to legal counsel and subjected to “inhumane and unlawful” treatment.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a US rights watchdog, announced the emergency lawsuit ( PDF ) on Friday.\n\nIt highlights deteriorating conditions at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview since President Donald Trump began his immigration crackdown earlier this year.\n\n“Everyone, no matter their legal status, has the right to access counsel and to not be subject to horrific and inhumane conditions,” Alexa Van Brunt, the director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office and lead counsel on the suit, said in a news statement.\n\n“Community members are being kidnapped off the streets, packed in hold cells, denied food, medical care, and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights.”\n\nThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Pablo Moreno Gonzalez and Felipe Agustin Zamacona, are immigrants from Mexico who have lived in the US for more than 30 years. Both are currently detained inside the Broadview facility.\n\nTheir suit names senior Trump officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Director Todd Lyons, as defendants.\n\nThe complaint is the latest to allege  abusive conditions  and neglect at immigration facilities. A similar class-action suit was filed against the Trump administration in August, highlighting the detention centre at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City.\n\nFriday’s complaint, however, zooms in on the Broadview facility, a two-story office building that serves as the “primary processing facility” for ICE in the  Chicago  area.\n\nLawyers for the two immigrants, however, argue that the number of immigrants housed in the facility outstrips its ability to safely handle them.\n\nAccording to ICE data cited in the lawsuit, nearly 5,202 people have been held at Broadview between January and July of this year. At any given time, at least 200 people are inside the facility.\n\nBut the numbers have increased since the Trump administration launched what it calls Operation Midway Blitz on September 8. Led by Noem and the Department of Homeland Security, Midway Blitz was designed to increase immigration arrests in the Chicago area.\n\nThat push has placed strain on the Broadview facility, according to the class action. It explains that, while Broadview was intended as a “holding facility” for short-term detention, it is now being used for “warehousing people” for “days on end”.\n\n“ICE officers have even held eight women in an isolation room designed for a single person for at least a day,” the lawsuit alleged.\n\n“The increased number of immigration arrests during Operation Midway Blitz has resulted in overcrowding at Broadview so extreme that people are forced to stand in cramped conditions. There often is not even room for detainees to lie down on the floor.”\n\nIt also describes rooms with bodily fluid on the wall, overflowing toilets and infestations of cockroaches and centipedes.\n\n“We told the guards that the place was at full capacity, but they kept bringing people inside,” one anonymous woman is quoted as saying in the lawsuit. “They treated us like animals, or worse than animals, because no one treats their pets like that.”\n\nThe lawsuit also asserts that detainees have been denied access to adequate food, water, hygiene and medical care.\n\nWhile some detainees have been allowed to use a cellphone or landline for a brief period to contact legal representation or family, the complaint says that the conversations have been held in a central area where federal officers were able to listen to the conversations.\n\nSome detainees have been denied access to outside communication altogether, the lawsuit added, and lawyers and religious representatives have been prohibited from entering.\n\nWhile immigration facilities are subject to oversight by members of Congress, the lawsuit alleges that federal representatives have likewise been barred from entering the facility.\n\n“Access to counsel is not a privilege. It is a right,” Nate Eimer, a partner at the law firm Eimer Stahl and co-counsel in the lawsuit, said in a statement.\n\n“We can debate immigration policy, but there is no debating the denial of legal rights and holding those detained in conditions that are not only unlawful but inhumane.”\n\nThe Trump administration has consistently denied allegations of abusive conditions in ICE facilities.\n\nBut Operation Midway Blitz has been the subject of intense scrutiny since its launch, as reports of abuse mount.\n\nAdvocates have accused the aggressive immigration operation, often carried out by armed, masked agents, of demonstrating a “pattern of extreme brutality”.\n\nIncidents include a recent case where tear gas was deployed near a neighbourhood Halloween parade, with young children present."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/hurricane-melissa-now-category-3-threatens-heavy-floods-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:51:09+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa, now Category 4, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, now a Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 185 km/h, is threatening Jamaica and southern Haiti with catastrophic flooding, landslides, and power outages.

the past five years, according to a report issued by NGOs.\n\nDespite global efforts to phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/white-house-restricts-press-office-access-citing-sensitive-material","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"23:08:52Z","title":"White House restricts press office access citing sensitive material","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has restricted access to Room 140 of the White House press office, requiring reporters to obtain prior appointments to enter, citing the need to protect sensitive national security material due to increased coordination between the National Security Council and White House communications staff.

2025-10-31T22:25:19+00:00\n\nTitle: UN Security Council supports Morocco’s plan for Western Sahara\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has adopted a resolution stating that genuine autonomy for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty could be the most feasible solution to Rabat’s 50-year conflict with the Algeria-backed Polisario Front.\n\nWestern Sahara, a tract of desert the size of Britain, has been the scene of Africa’s longest-running territorial dispute since colonial power Spain left in 1975 and Morocco annexed the territory.\n\nThe UNSC, in a United States-drafted text, on Friday called for the parties to engage in negotiations based on an autonomy plan first presented by Morocco to the UN in 2007.\n\nMorocco considers the territory its own while the Polisario Front seeks to establish an independent state called the Sahrawi Republic.\n\n“We urge all parties to use the coming weeks to come to the table and engage in serious discussions,” US ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz told the council after the vote on Friday. “We believe regional peace is possible this year, and we will make every effort to facilitate progress.”\n\nRussia, China and Pakistan abstained, while Algeria did not vote. The remaining 11 council members voted in favour of the resolution, which also renewed for one year the mandate of the UN peacekeeping force in Western Sahara, known as the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).\n\n“The final decision on the future cannot, must not, belong to anyone other than the people under colonial domination,” Algeria’s UN ambassador, Amar Bendjama, told the council after the vote. “This text ignores the proposals of the Polisario Front … They are a party to the conflict, and their opinion must be heard.”\n\nMorocco’s autonomy proposal would establish a local legislative, executive and judicial authority for Western Sahara elected by its residents, while Rabat would retain jurisdiction over defence, foreign affairs and religious matters.\n\nThe Polisario instead wants to hold a referendum with independence as an option.\n\nMorocco is seeking a win-win and “face-saving” solution for all the parties to the conflict, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said after the UN vote. He urged Sahrawi refugees held in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps in southwestern Algeria to endorse autonomy.\n\nThe king also renewed his call for a “brotherly dialogue” with Algeria and said Morocco is committed to the Maghreb Union.\n\n“We are opening a new and victorious chapter in the process of enshrining the Moroccan character of the Sahara, which is intended to bring this issue to a definitive close,” King Mohammed said in a speech in which he expressed his “immense pride”.\n\nThousands gathered in the streets of Morocco’s cities to celebrate the vote, carrying flags and chanting patriotic slogans.\n\nPolisario Front representative Sidi Omar said the resolution does not imply any recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. He said the Polisario Front leadership would assess the UN resolution and make an official position public in due course.\n\nThe Security Council resolution also asked UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to provide within six months “a strategic review regarding MINURSO’s future mandate, taking into account the outcome of the negotiations”.\n\nUS President Donald Trump reaffirmed support for Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara in July, saying a Moroccan autonomy plan for the territory was the sole solution. Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff had said the US is working on a peace deal between Algeria and Morocco.\n\nFrance made a similar move, recognising Rabat’s sovereignty over the territory and greenlighting investments there. In June, Britain became the third UNSC member to back autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. Spain has also backed Rabat’s position, along with an increasing number of European states, signalling a shift in European Union member states’ foreign policy on the issue."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on October 19, 2025, through its space agency SUPARCO.

2025-10-31T00:11:41.551+00:00\n\nTitle: The US bet big on Argentina bailout - is it paying off?\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been the point-person entrusted with selling financial markets on some of President Donald Trump's riskiest economic gambles: sweeping global tariffs, trade talks with China and preparations to install a new leader at the US central bank.\n\nBut Bessent's trickiest task may just be the White House bet on Argentina.\n\nThe US stepped onto the scene in mid-September, responding to a plunge in the peso - the Argentine currency - which officials feared could imperil Trump ally President Javier Milei and his party in looming midterm elections.\n\nBessent said the US would do whatever was needed to stabilise the situation, calling the country a key ally in the region.\n\nIn political terms, the US intervention - which included purchases of pesos and the establishment of a $20bn (£15bn) currency swap line that gives the Argentine central bank access to dollars - was a success for Milei.\n\nHis party not only fended off losses in the midterm elections but made inroads, strengthening his position.\n\nBut whether the US intervention in the country will be a success financially is another question.\n\nThe peso has fallen roughly 30% this year, including roughly 4% over the last month. The drop came despite the US commitments - and a modest rally after the election.\n\nIt's an indication of the ongoing risk. At the end of the day, the US could find itself holding a pile of pesos worth much less than they were originally.\n\nThe intervention in Argentina was a highly unusual move - especially from a White House known for its \"America First\" approach.\n\nMilei has endeared himself to conservatives in the US with his embrace of free-market reforms and radical spending cuts. He has met frequently with Trump, who has called him his \"favourite president\".\n\nBut the US has rarely offered financial bailouts to other countries - especially in a case that posed no wider financial stability risks - and direct purchases of a struggling emerging market currency are unprecedented, says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAdding to the risk is Argentina's long history of currency devaluation and debt default, including most recently in 2020.\n\nFew are positioned to be as aware of the potential pitfalls as Bessent, who made his name as a currency trader working for George Soros.\n\nBessent famously took part in the 1992 speculation against the British pound. At that time, investors who bet that Sterling had been overvalued were said to have broken the Bank of England with their heavy selling.\n\nThis time, Bessent finds himself on the opposite side of similar gamble. He has defended his moves, invoking the spectre of fellow South American country, Venezuela, and arguing that failure to shore up Argentina as a US ally could lead to destabilisation in the region.\n\n\"These results are a clear example that the Trump Administration policy of Peace through Economic Strength is working,\" Bessent wrote on social media after the recent election in Argentina.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bessent posted again to say: \"the Argentine economic bridge has now turned a profit for the American people\".\n\nThe US Treasury Department did not respond to inquiries seeking more details.\n\nBut it has kept quiet about key information needed to assess Bessent's claims - including the timeline and scale of its peso purchases - or sales - and what, if any, other assets the Argentine government pledged in order to secure the swap deal.\n\nAnalysts have estimated the US has purchased as much as $2bn worth of pesos so far - hardly an earth-shattering figure.\n\nBut Democrats have criticised the help at a time of White House spending cuts and an ongoing government shutdown, accusing Bessent of wanting to protect finance \"buddies\" with investments in the country.\n\nEven some members of Trump's own Republican Party have questioned how the aid aligns with the president's \"America First\" goals.\n\nBessent has disputed any characterisation of the US support for Argentina as a \"bailout\", promising there will be \"no taxpayer losses\" and even declaring the peso \"undervalued\".\n\nBut while that could be true for a short-term trade, that view is not the general consensus.\n\nTo the contrary - most analysts say the peso is overvalued, but has been propped up by support from the Argentine central bank, which set trading limits for the peso in April.\n\nEconomists say maintaining such limits is not sustainable. They cite the surge in Argentines travelling to make purchases in neighbouring countries where their money travels farther as one of the signs that the peso is being held artificially high.\n\nThe Argentine central bank has insisted it is committed to the trading band, which was intended to protect the country from wild currency swings destabilising prices and support Milei's efforts to control inflation.\n\nBut it has already had to spend billions buying pesos to keep the currency steady, burning through International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding and dipping into its foreign reserves, which are key to paying its debt obligations.\n\nEconomists say they expect the bank will have to change its policy to allow the peso to fall more - or the country risks needing another bailout.\n\nThat choice presents a dilemma for Bessent, given his promises to guard the US against losses.\n\n\"Is the US willing to provide support to Argentina so that Argentina can defend the peso at this level?\" Mr Setser asks. \"Bessent has to decide in a sense whether to double down... or he has to let the peso adjust and recognise that his intervention was a bridge to the election.\"\n\nThe peso plummeted ahead of the midterms, as businesses and households in Argentina rushed to trade the currency for dollars.\n\nPeople wanted to protect themselves, remembering the way the currency collapsed in 2019   after the election loss of former president Mauricio Macri, who was also known for economic reform,   says Joaquín Bagües, managing director of Buenos Aires-based Grit Capital Group.\n\n\"Every single guy that I talked to, they wanted to buy dollars... they have very fresh memories about that,\" he said, describing the run as a \"confidence crisis.\"\n\nMr Bagües says the demand for dollars has eased since the election.\n\nBut the peso has not experienced the kind of sustained relief seen in other assets, like bonds or the stock market, which surged more than 20% the day after the election and has continued to rise.\n\nWhile Argentine companies are starting to tap international lending markets again, after being frozen out ahead of the election, analysts say they expect US banks to remain wary of lending to Argentina, despite a push by Bessent to arrange an additional $20bn in private financing.\n\nAnd Mr Bagües says there are too many policy questions ahead to predict what will happen to the peso.\n\nKathryn Exum, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy Funds Management, suggests that the peso could rise \"over the medium term\" if the government is able to continue advancing economic reforms.\n\nBut, she adds, \"there's a lot that needs to be done between now and then\".\n\nFor now, Anthony Simond, investment director on the emerging market debt team at Aberdeen Group, says he expects the peso has farther to fall.\n\n\"Bessent may say one thing, but I think the economic reality may force them to be a little bit more flexible in terms of currency management,\" he says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjekdqj7529o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"14:28:26.339+00:00","title":"Just Stop Oil activists cleared over Stonehenge protest","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Three Just Stop Oil activists — Rajan Naidu, Niamh Lynch, and Luke Watson — were acquitted of charges of causing a public nuisance after spraying Stonehenge with orange powder on 19 June 2024.

Just Stop Oil activists cleared over Stonehenge protest\n\nThree Just Stop Oil activists who sprayed Stonehenge with orange powder have been cleared of causing a public nuisance.\n\nRajan Naidu, 74, Oxford University student Niamh Lynch, 23, and Luke Watson, 36, were acquitted following a  10-day trial at Salisbury Crown Court .\n\nThey had denied all charges of damaging an ancient protected monument and causing a public nuisance, after  targeting Stonehenge  as part of an ongoing fossil fuel protest by the direct action group.\n\nThe trio accepted taking part in the protest and cited in their defence \"reasonable excuse\" and their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights to freedom of speech and freedom to protest.\n\nMr Naidu from Birmingham, Ms Lynch from Bedford and Mr Watson from Essex, had been accused of using two colour blasters filled with cornflour, talc and an orange dye to spray the monument in a  protest on 19 June 2024 .\n\nThe court was told the trio targeted Stonehenge the day before last year's summer solstice where around 15,000 people were due to gather and celebrate.\n\nMr Watson had bought the equipment used in the attack and had  borrowed his grandmother's petrol car  to drive the co-accused to Stonehenge that morning.\n\nAfter the attack, both Mr Naidu and Ms Lynch sat in silence in front of the stones, where they were then arrested by police.\n\nThe powder was promptly cleaned from the stones at a cost of £620.\n\nThe defendants argued that it was a \"peaceful protest\", that the rights of others were not \"greatly interfered with\", that care had been taken in choosing the type of powder to use.\n\nThere was no lasting damage to the stones and they argued that protesting about fossil fuels was a legitimate cause.\n\nSimon Jones prosecuting alleged the protest, which was filmed by other Just Stop Oil supporters, had been \"carefully planned\" and it was \"an act of blatant and clear vandalism\".\n\nGiving his legal directions to the jury, Judge Paul Dugdale said they had to determine whether a conviction would be a \"proportionate interference\" with the protestors rights and said \"everyone's entitled to express their own opinion\" even if we disagree.\n\n\"If individuals disagree with what our Government is doing on certain matters they are entitled to protest about the Government's actions or inactions,\" he said.\n\n\"There are times when protecting the right to freedom of speech and freedom to protest can mean that activity that would otherwise be unlawful would be regarded as lawful by the court to protect those rights,\" he added.\n\nAfter the jury, which took six hours to deliberate, returned its verdict the trio hugged each other in the dock.\n\nRepresenting the protestors, solicitor Francesca Cociani, from law firm Hodge Jones & Allen, said her clients were \"incredibly relieved\" by the verdict.\n\n\"The public nuisance charge in this case, which argued their protest could have caused serious distress, annoyance or inconvenience to the public, was wholly inadequate and, in our view, should never have been brought, and amounted to an affront to their right to protest,\" she said.\n\n\"It is a relief that the jury has decided to uphold the right to peaceful protest,\" she added.\n\nMs Cociani said the right to peaceful protest was \"an essential pillar of our democratic society\" which \"time and time again\" is being \"eroded\".\n\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on  Facebook ,  X  and  Instagram .

titles and privileges of the former Prince Andrew have been completely removed.\n\nThere are no modern precedents for such a colossal loss of royal status.\n\nUnlike the previous statement on his future, this was from Buckingham Palace rather than Andrew himself.\n\nIt's a ripping off the bandage moment, which the Palace will hope will finally draw a line under the endless oil slick of bad news stories about Andrew.\n\nThe sliver of dignity given to him, that he was voluntarily choosing not to use his titles, has been taken away.\n\nTitles such as Duke of York, the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh will be forcibly removed.\n\nAll that remains is his place in the line of succession, and new guidance from the House of Commons Library has shown that too could be removed by Parliament, if Commonwealth realms give their consent.\n\nAfter more than a year of pressure, the so-called Siege of Royal Lodge is over, with Andrew losing his independent lease and moving to the King's estate in Sandringham. It's not revealed where exactly, but it's not Wood Farm.\n\nSandringham is privately owned by the King, ending any reliance on a Crown Estate property.\n\nHis ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is said to be making her own separate arrangements, not currently expected to be with Andrew in Norfolk.\n\nIt makes Andrew dependent on the King for his home and his money. And also it has to be said, a duty of care for his brother's welfare.\n\nThis announcement might head off the immediate threat of Parliament taking matters into its own hands and voting to strip Andrew of his titles. MPs had become increasingly vocal about debating the scandal and the Public Accounts Committee had been flexing its muscles over protecting public funding.\n\nBut it's going to be much harder for the Palace to settle an authentic feeling of public outrage. The sense of unchecked privilege surrounding Andrew has genuinely irritated the public and it will take more than taking away his titles to dispel the sense of ugly entitlement.\n\nPolling by YouGov published on Thursday showed Andrew now has the worst ever popularity ratings for a royal, with 91% holding a negative view of him.\n\nAnd the King heard that unhappiness first hand from a heckler in Lichfield this week, who shouted: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\"\n\nFor the Palace, there will be questions about why such longstanding problems around Andrew weren't dealt with before now. So much of this has been known for so many years - the unsuitable business links, the unexplained funding, the connections with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The cast list changes - alleged Chinese spies or dictators' wealthy relatives - but the story has remained the same.\n\nThe unsavoury link with Epstein was being widely discussed 14 years ago when Andrew was stripped of his role as trade representative.\n\nAndrew has been losing jobs but continuing to live in a royal style for many years now and it's stretched public patience. It felt arrogant and out of touch.\n\nA few clicks on Google will find decades of stories raising doubts about his suitability, often accompanied by pictures of Andrew in a top hat, like a renegade Monopoly piece.\n\nThere might be some public fatigue around this Andrew story. People might feel they've heard enough and are sick of it. But there was also an angry public mood that expected a clearer sense of accountability.\n\nWhat remains to be seen now is whether a wider can of worms has been opened.\n\nWho knew what and when at the Palace about Andrew and Epstein? Do we need more transparency around royal property and finance? How many houses do they have up their sleeve in Windsor? And what fresh scandals about Andrew could still emerge?\n\nBut this scorched earth approach to Andrew's future might also show an unexpectedly steely side to the King.\n\nWhile other members of the Royal Family were part of the decision, including Prince William, it's understood that it was the King who made this big call on his brother's future. Whatever the grandstanding of pundits, it can't have been an easy decision.\n\nThere seemed to have been an irrevocable change of attitude when  an email from Andrew to Epstein emerged,  showing their continued contact. It seemed to destroy Andrew's promises in the Newsnight interview to have cut ties.\n\nIt no longer seemed tenable that Andrew should have the honour of being a prince and living in some splendour among the royals in Windsor.\n\nInstead the King highlighted the victims of abuse, whose stories lie at the dark heart of Epstein's circle.\n\nIt's not long since Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, was grinning on the Buckingham Palace balcony, waving to the crowds. He'll wake up tomorrow morning for the first time in his life as Mr Mountbatten Windsor, private citizen.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis  every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

Banks can't get pennies from the federal government, so businesses can't get them from the banks.\n\n\"We first heard about the issue in late August, early September,\" Mr Jeon said. \"It's really impacting any business that deals with cash payments.\"\n\nNow store clerks don't know what to do when their tills are bare and someone needs change in pennies from a cash purchase.\n\nThe temporary solution for many, Mr Jeon said, is rounding the price of the sale up or down to the nearest five cents so the customer can use a nickel, the next lowest tender in the US.\n\nBut some cities, including New York, require retailers to give exact change and others don't allow cash payments to differ from card payments for the same item, Mr Jeon said.\n\nTo avoid lawsuits and customer complaints, many retailers have chosen to just round down.\n\n\"You're talking about losing up to four cents for every cash transaction across multiple stores across the country,\" he said. \"It's unsustainable.\"\n\nMany stores are now urging customers to pay in exact change. Others are hosting promotions for customers to bring in extra pennies they have at home.\n\nConvenience stores are some of the hardest hit by the shortage, said Jeff Lenard, a spokesperson for the National Association of Convenience Stores.\n\nConvenience giant Kwik Trip has announced it is rounding down to the nickel, which it says will cost it up to $3m (£2.3m) this year.\n\nAmerican coins have been discontinued before, including the half-cent, three-cent and 20-cent pieces that were retired in the 1800s, Mr Lenard said. It's been many years, though, since a staple like the penny - which entered ciruclation in 1793 - has ceased production.\n\n\"People don't want the penny until they can't get it back in change,\" he said.\n\nIt costs nearly four cents to make a penny.\n\nBut keeping the zinc and copper coins in circulation will help lower-income Americans who primarily pay in cash, said Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents.\n\n\"These are people that don't have the access to checking accounts and charge cards and banking services,\" he said. \"You hurting lower-income groups when you start rounding transactions.\"\n\nHe also thinks the government savings from not producing pennies will be offset by the need for more nickels, which are worth five cents but cost nearly 14 cents to make.\n\nPeople watching the penny world believe there needs to be federal guidance for both businesses and shoppers on rounding, how to carry out transactions during the shortage, and generally what to do with the coins.\n\n\"There will always be pennies out there, it's just such a low-utilisation coin,\" said Mr Jeon. \"People forget about them in their pockets, they lose them in their couch, they're sitting in jars. Those are coins that aren't making it into circulation.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e3de5ny14o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:45:28.153+00:00","title":"South Africa hits back at US plan to favour white Afrikaner 'refugees'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Africa has strongly rejected the US administration's proposal to prioritize refugee applications from white Afrikaners, dismissing claims of a 'white genocide' as false, unsubstantiated, and racially motivated.

These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.\n\n\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"\n\nThe language of Buckingham Palace's statement was \"very brutal,\" royal historian Kelly Swaby told the BBC.\n\n\"Ordinary people don't care about the semantics, they want to see punishment, and public opinion is very much against Andrew, the Palace knows that, and the language very much reflects that\".\n\nThe decision was made, and action taken, due to serious lapses in Andrew's judgement, it is understood.\n\nIt is also understood that the wider Royal Family and the government was consulted, and made clear it supports the decision.\n\nThe BBC's former royal correspondent Jennie Bond said she thought the Prince of Wales had pushed for the recent action.\n\n\"I think this line had to be drawn and William was probably pushing for the King to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"William is about to go to Brazil on a very important tour - and the recent tour by the King and Queen to the Vatican was very nearly overshadowed by what was going on with Andrew, and that could not be allowed to continue.\"\n\nIt is understood Andrew will be relocated to the  Sandringham estate  in Norfolk, but details about his specific housing have not been released.\n\nThe wider Sandringham estate covers approximately 20,000 acres (8,100 hectares) with 600 acres (242 hectares) of gardens - and the Palace has not said which property he will stay in.\n\nIt is understood that Andrew is unlikely to move into Sandringham's Wood Farm, his late father's former home.\n\nFormal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday and it is understood that Andrew's move to Sandringham will take place \"as soon as practicable\".\n\nAndrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, 66, will also move out of Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements, it is understood.\n\nShe lost her courtesy royal divorcee title as a duchess in early October, when Andrew lost the use of his Duke of York title - reverting to her maiden name.\n\nThough the public had long referred to her as \"Fergie\", royal commentator Richard Palmer  told the BBC at the time  the title change would \"no doubt\" have an impact.\n\n\"She will have lost a bit of cachet over this,\" he said. \"She certainly does use the title.\"\n\nFor their daughters - Beatrice, 37 and Eugenie, 35 - there is no formal change.\n\nThey will still be princesses because they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign - in line with King George V's Letters Patent of 1917.\n\nTheir places in the line of succession will also stay the same.\n\nAndrew remains eighth in line to the throne despite losing his titles - followed by Beatrice and Eugenie in ninth and twelfth place.\n\nBut their positions in the family are \"low down\" and will likely slip further with time, royal commentator Victoria Murphy said previously - adding that she could not see them, as non-working royals, step into official duties any time soon.\n\nThere was an \"appreciation of the fact that this scandal doesn't involve them,\" she also said, \"and it's not fair for it to impact them directly in the independent lives they are carving out for themselves\".\n\nIt is understood Andrew's accommodation will be privately funded by the King.\n\nAnd the King will make \"appropriate private provision\" for his brother as he moves out of his home.\n\nRoyal sources have previously said the King has tried to apply pressure, and last year cut off Andrew's funding.\n\nAndrew also cultivated his own independent sources of funding since leaving public life, including business connections with China, the Gulf States and a recently curtailed project with a Dutch start-up company.\n\nEarlier this week, Parliament's spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee wrote a letter detailing the \"considerable and understandable public interest in the spending of public money\" relating to Andrew.\n\nThe letter asked what the Crown Estate's plan was to ensure value for money in any future agreements with Andrew.\n\nAndrew is understood not to have objected to the King's decision to remove his titles.\n\nHis birth certificate does not need to be changed and the title change will not apply retrospectively.\n\nThe titles being stripped are: Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh. And he will no longer have the right to be called His Royal Highness. The honours of Order of the Garter and Knight Grand Cross of the Victorian Order will also be removed.\n\nTo remove the titles, the King will send Royal warrants to the Lord Chancellor - who is David Lammy - to officially remove them.\n\nIt comes just weeks after Andrew voluntarily gave up his other royal titles, including the Duke of York.\n\nOn 17 October, Andrew said he would stop using the titles because the \"continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family\". \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\" he said.\n\nUntil this month, Ferguson kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York - but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew was stripped of his Duke of York title.\n\nThe surname Mountbatten Windsor was created in 1960, and combines the surnames of the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip when they married.\n\nIn 1917, fearful of the anti-German sentiment in the UK the reigning monarch, George V, adopted the name Windsor to replace the original Germanic sounding house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty.\n\nHe renamed the lineage Windsor, after the castle.\n\nMountbatten is an anglicised version of Battenberg. The Duke of Edinburgh's mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg, but during the First World War the family opted to change it to Mountbatten, again to avoid more anti-German sentiment.\n\nThe double-barrelled name was a concession to the Duke of Edinburgh, who was said to have complained that his children would not bear his name.\n\nAndrew is already not invited to attend royal public events, and his recent appearances have been limited to private, family events, such as funerals or memorials.\n\nThis fiasco will continue to dog the Royal Family, says historian and author Andrew Lownie.\n\n\"They're finally getting ahead of the story, but this isn't the end of it,\" Lownie told the BBC.\n\nThe Palace is \"finally taking some decisive action\" - but it \"won't completely satisfy the public disquiet\".\n\nCampaigners against the monarchy say there should be a wider investigation into what the Royal Family might have known about Prince Andrew's links to Epstein.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that then Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection.\n\nAndrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges, but large sections of the media will continue digging into the case.\n\nAndrew's links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are at the centre of this latest announcement.\n\nIn recent weeks, pressure has increased on the monarchy to resolve the issue of Charles's brother, with the King heckled earlier this week by a protester.\n\nAlthough Andrew denies the accusations, the Royal Family considers there have been \"serious lapses of judgement\" in his behaviour.\n\nEarlier this month, emails from 2011 re-emerged, showing Andrew in contact with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein months after he claimed their friendship ended.\n\nIn her posthumous memoir, Nobody's Girl Virginia Giuffre repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three separate occasions – claims he has always denied."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c201zvrpvw9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:46:11.747+00:00","title":"Where might Andrew live on the Sandringham estate?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, recently stripped of his 'prince' title, is relocating from Royal Lodge in Windsor to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, marking a major shift in his royal residence.

Andrew is moving from his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, it is understood.\n\nFormal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday, and the move will take place as soon as possible.\n\nThe historic, sprawling estate spans approximately 31 sq miles (80 sq km) of gardens - making it around the same size as Nottingham or Brighton and Hove.\n\nIt was bought as a private country retreat for the future Edward VII when he was Albert, Prince of Wales in 1862, and has since been passed down from monarch to monarch.\n\nThe estate itself covers several residential villages and hamlets, and includes 15 sq miles (40 sq km) of farmland.\n\nThe main building - Sandringham House - is thought to have more than a hundred rooms, including a ballroom.\n\nIt remains a country retreat for the Royal Family and is where they traditionally gather at Christmas.\n\nAndrew will be moving some 140 miles (225km) north-east of his Windsor mansion - and away from senior royals like King Charles III and Queen Camilla, who reside in London, and the Prince and Princess of Wales in Windsor.\n\nSome assumed Andrew would move from Royal Lodge to another property on the Windsor estate, Frogmore Cottage for example, royal biographer Robert Hardman told the BBC.\n\n\"But no,\" he said, \"he's off the estate, he's out of Windsor, he's out of royal Berkshire - he's been sent up the M11 to the royal equivalent of Siberia to sit in Sandringham for the rest of his life.\"\n\n\"This is - some might say brutal, others might say definitive.\"\n\nSandringham is a private estate - not an official royal residence - and it is understood the King will be privately funding Andrew's accommodation there, and that it will not be directly funded by the taxpayer.\n\nThe Palace has not yet said exactly where on the estate Andrew will live, or when he could move.\n\nBut royal sources have said it will not be immediate, and instead be \"as soon as possible and practicable\".\n\nHere is a look at some of the options on the estate.\n\nOriginally known as Bachelor's Cottage, York Cottage is about a quarter of a mile from the main house.\n\nIt has its own set of stables and kennel buildings, according to Historic England, and overlooks one of two man-made lakes on the estate.\n\nThere were reports ahead of Prince Harry's marriage to the Duchess of Sussex that the pair might have been gifted the use of York Cottage by Elizabeth II for use as a country home, but no such plan was ever confirmed and the move never materialised.\n\nIt has reportedly been used as an office and accommodation for staff in recent years.\n\nThe birthplace of Diana, Princess of Wales and her childhood home, Park House was rented by the Spencer family for many years.\n\nIn 1983 it was gifted to Leonard Cheshire, a disability charity, which used it to run a 16-bedroom hotel for the disabled, their carers and family.\n\nThe charity planned a £2.3m refurbishment before the pandemic hit, but announced in 2020 it would not go ahead with the proposal and said instead that it was working with the Sandringham estate to exit the lease.\n\nAnother option is the Gardens House, which was once the residence of the head gardener on the Sandringham estate.\n\nThe Edwardian house has six bedrooms and three bathrooms, is dog-friendly and is one of two properties on the estate available to the general public as a holiday let.\n\nIts grounds hold a working sawmill and organic farm.\n\nIt was  put on the market in July  at a weekly price of £4,110. It is not unusual for royal residences to rent out property to holidaymakers - with eight cottages and lodges available for hire at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\n\nAnother possibility is The Folly - a three-bedroom, two-bathroom lodge built in the 1800s.\n\nComplete with a turret and a wraparound balcony, it has been used as a hunting lodge and a place to take afternoon tea.\n\nAlso listed as a holiday let to the public, it is said to have room for six guests - a change from the 30-room Windsor mansion Andrew will be vacating.\n\nGiven the lodge's \"grandeur\", Majesty Magazine's managing editor Joe Little told the BBC earlier this year, there is a \"a heightened awareness that the privately owned royal estates are actively striving to bolster\" the Royal Family's revenue streams.\n\nThis is one option that is understood to have been ruled out.\n\nThe farmhouse, described as \"small and intimate\" by former housekeeper Teresa Thompson, has strong associations with Andrew's parents.\n\nHis father, the late Duke of Edinburgh, chose the secluded property as his permanent home when he retired from public life in 2017.\n\nHe and the late Queen already regularly stayed there in preference to opening up Sandringham House when it was just the two of them.\n\nAnmer Hall was gifted to the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales as a wedding present by the late queen in 2013 - so this may be an unlikely choice.\n\nThey spend much of the school holidays in the 10-bedroom, Grade II*-listed house, which is about 2 miles (3km) east of the main Sandringham house.\n\nThe Georgian property dates back to about 1802, but some parts are much older - and it has formed part of the Sandringham estate since 1898."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2emmdnw82yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:22:09.991Z","title":"Andrew Mountbatten Windsor will not leave Royal Lodge immediately","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III has stripped Andrew Mountbatten Windsor of his titles and honours, citing serious lapses in judgment tied to his connections with Jeffrey Epstein and allegations of sexual misconduct involving Virginia Giuffre.

Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has said it had no plans to pass a law to formally remove Andrew from the line of succession.\n\nAndrew remains eighth in line to the throne, the only significant position he still holds - but there have been calls to bring in legislation to stop any chance of him becoming King.\n\nIt would take an act of Parliament to formally remove him which would be complex and would need to be agreed with all the Commonwealth realms, including Australia and Canada.\n\nBuckingham Palace has said Andrew's move from Royal Lodge in Windsor to Sandringham will take place \"as soon as possible and practicable\".\n\nBut according to royal sources, a delay in Andrew moving until the new year would avoid the embarrassment of him being in Sandringham at Christmas - where the Royal Family traditionally gathers for the festive season.\n\nAndrew will move to an undisclosed property on the privately-owned estate, with the accommodation funded by the King who will also make private financial provisions for his brother.\n\nSandringham was bought in 1862 by the then Prince of Wales, who later became Edward VII, as a private country retreat.\n\nThe historic, sprawling estate spans approximately 31 sq miles (80 sq km) of gardens - making it around the same size as Nottingham or Brighton and Hove.\n\nOn Friday, fresh court documents were published in the US showing Andrew said in 2010 it would be \"good to catch up in person\" with Epstein, after the convicted sex offender was released from prison for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nIn an email on dated 15 April 2010, Epstein suggested the then-prince should meet American banker Jes Staley, which Andrew said he was not able to do due to his schedule.\n\n\"I have no immediate plans to drop by New York but I think I should at some stage soon,\" he told Epstein.\n\n\"I'll look and see if I can make a couple of days before the summer.\n\n\"It would be good to catch up in person.\"\n\nThe pair were later pictured together in Central Park in New York in December 2010 in a meeting that Andrew claimed in his 2019 Newsnight interview was to break off their friendship.\n\nIt is understood the move to remove Andrew's titles was taken by the King in light of the serious lapses of judgement his brother made, and that his decision was supported by the wider Royal Family.\n\nThe public also seems to back the decision - according to a YouGov poll published on Thursday, 79% of people backed taking away the title and 53% thought the King had now done all that he could.\n\nThere were 58% who thought this response should have come sooner, with concerns that the royals had been too slow to take action over the links to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nSir Keir Starmer also \"fully supports\" the Palace's decision, Downing Street said, and echoed Buckingham Palace's statement of support for Epstein's victims.\n\nThe controversy around Andrew has been rumbling on for years, but came to a head when he was accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager.\n\nAndrew has strenuously denied the allegations.\n\nIn 2022 he paid millions to settle a civil case with her, despite insisting he did not remember meeting her.\n\nVirginia Giuffre's family said  she had \"brought down a prince\"  following the King's decision.\n\nHer brother Sky Roberts called for Andrew to be \"investigated\" and said the King's decision to remove his titles was \"not enough, in the sense that he's still walking around a free man\".\n\n\"I mean, let's not be naive, that he's not going to be living on the side of the road here, he's still in a very, let's say, cushy spot... He should be investigated, let's put it that way,\" he told Sky News.\n\nThe UK trade minister Chris Bryant told the BBC Andrew should, if asked, go to the US to answer questions about the crimes of Epstein.\n\n\"I think that, just as with any ordinary member of the public, if there were requests from another jurisdiction of this kind, I would expect any decently minded person to comply with that request,\" he said.\n\nGloria Allred, who has represented victims of Jeffrey Epstein, said Andrew losing his title and grand home was \"long overdue\" and \"definitely welcome\".\n\n\"This is a man who should no longer walk with honour. He should be ashamed of himself,\" the American lawyer said.\n\nMs Allred has long called for Andrew to speak to US law enforcement about his former friend Epstein \"under oath\" - something he has \"declined\" to do so far, she said.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has previously said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that Andrew tried to obtain personal information about his accuser Ms Giuffre through his police protection."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylqpyg8pjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"15:29:21.919+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa: Death toll rises as aid effort struggles to reach parts of Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful category five storm, made landfall in Jamaica on October 22, 2025, causing catastrophic damage, with at least 19 deaths in Jamaica and 30 in Haiti.

Jamaica as a result of Hurricane Melissa, Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon says, as search and rescue efforts continue and authorities try to get aid to hard-hit areas.\n\nThe hurricane, one of the most powerful to strike the Caribbean, also killed at least 30 people in Haiti, officials say.\n\nIn Jamaica, \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened\", Dixon said, with \"devastating\" scenes in western regions.\n\nElectricity remains out to most of the island and as people try to salvage damaged homes and belongings from flood water and mud, many thousands are growing increasingly desperate for aid.\n\nParts of the country have been without water for several days and food is growing increasingly scarce.\n\nAid supplies are starting to arrive more rapidly with the main airport in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, largely back to normal, but smaller regional airports, some of which are located near to where humanitarian assistance is most needed, remain only partly operational.\n\nAid agencies and the military are bringing in the urgently needed supplies from Kingston by land but many roads remain unpassable in places.\n\nA journey from Mandeville, in the centre of the country, to Black River - normally an hour - is taking eight hours because the roads are so torn up.\n\nArmy vehicles and relief convoys are struggling to get past fallen trees and poles, leaving many who live in western areas very much without the aid they need.\n\nOn the drive towards Black River, the BBC saw devastating scenes that repeated throughout the country. Chunks of road were missing. Men in flip flops worked on the roofs of boarded houses, patching up missing shingles or nailing down sheets of zinc.\n\nOne woman, Olivia Cream,  who lost her house by the beach in Black River, told BBC she was sheltering in a neighbour's attic when the hurricane hit. The roof ripped off while they were in the attic, leaving them totally exposed.\n\n\"We watched everything come apart around us, we watched 30ft waves come in and throw everything into the sea,\" Cream said.\n\nWhen Cream returned to her own house, she saw that everything was gone - one kitchen cabinet remained intact, and luckily it had some food in it, she said.\n\n\"There are whole families living on the streets, with infants,\" Cream said of her town. \"We are trying to get them food. The area looks like Hiroshima, it looks like the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nIn Santa Cruz, the hum of running generators filled the air, as did the smells of gasoline, diesel exhaust and fresh mud. Everything was mud-soaked - walls, floors, people. Random coconuts were scattered across an empty lot and store owners swept water out of buildings.\n\nBarrington Robinson carried a long muddied machete over his shoulder as he stopped to talk in the parking lot, next to a grocery store where he works as a janitor. He was only able to reach this part of town by chopping through broken branches in his neighbourhood.\n\n\"Every place flooded out,\" he said. \"Me uncomfortable. Me don't know what to do.\"\n\nSatellite imagery shows  nearly all buildings in some Jamaican villages  have been destroyed by the hurricane.\n\nResidents of towns in western Jamaica told the BBC on Thursday that \"words can't explain how devastating\" the storm has been for the country.\n\n\"No-one is able to get through to their loved ones,\" Trevor 'Zyanigh' Whyte told the BBC from the town of White House in Westmoreland parish.\n\n\"Everyone is just, you know, completely disconnected... Every tree is on the road, right, so you can't get too far with the cars, not even a bicycle,\" he said.\n\nOn the drive from Kingston to Falmouth towards Montego Bay, the scene worsens. Walking around, there are buildings with half a roof and people drying their mattresses by the sides of the road.\n\nPeople are struggling to get their lives back together and trying to clear the streets, as the power company is trying to get poles moved.\n\nJamaica, a very green and mountainous country, has been stripped - leaving what looks like twigs and matchsticks.\n\nIn Haiti, many of the victims in the storm died when a river overflowed in Petit-Goave. A full assessment is ongoing, as there are still areas that authorities have not been able to access.\n\nAround 15,000 people were staying in more than 120 shelters in Haiti, interim UN co-ordinator for the country Gregoire Goodstein said.\n\nIn Cuba, more than 3 million people were \"exposed to life-threatening conditions\" during the hurricane, with 735,000 people \"safely evacuated\", according to the UN's resident co-ordinator for Cuba Francisco Pichon.\n\nNo fatalities have been reported so far in Cuba, but almost 240 communities have been cut off due to flooding and landslides, Cuban authorities said.\n\nHurricane Melissa made landfall on Tuesday in Jamaica as a category five storm, packing winds of up to 185 mph (295 km/h), before impacting other countries in the Caribbean.\n\nGovernments, humanitarian organisations and individuals around the world are pledging support for the nations hardest hit by the storm.\n\nThe World Food Programme said it is collaborating with partners to coordinate logistics, cash and emergency supplies across Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe US State Department said it is deploying a disaster response team to the region to help with search and rescue operations, and assisting in efforts to provide food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits and temporary shelters.\n\nThe UK government on Friday said it is mobilising an additional £5m ($6m) to send humanitarian supplies, including shelter kits and solar powered lanterns, to help people without power and whose homes have been damaged.\n\nThat is on top of £2.5m ($3.36m) already announced in emergency humanitarian funding to support recovery in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Foreign Office is also preparing flights to evacuate British nationals unable to come home on commercial flights.\n\nWhile Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti assessed the damage left in Melissa's wake, Bermuda braced for impact.\n\nThe Bermuda Weather Service expected Melissa to be a category two hurricane when it passed the British overseas territory on Thursday night.\n\nGovernment offices in Bermuda will close until Friday afternoon and all schools will shut on Friday.\n\n\"Until the official 'All Clear' is issued, residents are urged to stay off the roads so Government work crews can safely assess and clear debris,\" a public alert from the government said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Gabriela Pomeroy\n\nIf you experienced the hurricane in Jamaica,  please share your story ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6z5e5y55eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"16:48:17.555+00:00","title":"Dutch centrist Rob Jetten claims victory over Wilders in neck-and-neck election race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rob Jetten, leader of the centrist liberal party D66, has narrowly won the Dutch general election in a historic and closely contested race against anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.

claimed victory in Wednesday's nail-biting Dutch election, after vote analysis indicated his party could not be beaten by anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.\n\nJetten's D66 party currently has a narrow lead of 15,000 votes over Wilders' Freedom Party, and Dutch news agency ANP says even though the vote count is not complete, Wilders can no longer win.\n\n\"We are the biggest party in the Netherlands! Now we'll get to work for all Dutch people,\" Jetten posted on X.\n\nWilders said it was the electoral council not a news agency that decided the result: \"What arrogance not to wait for that.\"\n\nProjections from about 99% of the vote put both parties on 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament - but ANP says Jetten's centrists could win a 27th seat.\n\nJetten, 38, told reporters he was \"very proud of this historic result\" and now felt a great responsibility to form a stable and ambitious government.\n\nWilders had led opinion polls going into Wednesday's election, but Rob Jetten succeeded in winning in some of the main Dutch cities including Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht with a positive campaign using a catchphrase of \"Yes, we can\".\n\nNo Dutch election race has ever been so close, and if Jetten does become prime minister he will be the youngest in Dutch history.\n\nUntil now Jetten was careful not to declare victory until all votes were in, but ANP said based on figures from postal voters abroad he could now be declared the winner.\n\nWilders said even if D66 did go on to become the biggest party, his Freedom Party (PVV) would \"not let the Netherlands be broken up by Jetten and his people\".\n\nJetten told reporters that his party had \"shown to the rest of Europe and the world that it is possible to beat the populist movements if you campaign with a positive message\".\n\nThe Dutch electoral system is based on proportional representation in one nationwide constituency, so whichever party secures most votes wins most seats.\n\nJetten's liberals have so far won 16.9% of the vote, while Wilders' Freedom Party is on 16.7%. As results came in on Thursday, the race was so close that the lead flipped between the two parties.\n\nIn a sign that he was not ready to concede victory, Wilders dubbed the Dutch news agency \"ANP66\" and shared unfounded claims from social media of vote-rigging. One local authority, in Zaanstad outside Amsterdam, rejected the allegation as \"fabricated\".\n\nAlthough the D66 leader's path to forming a coalition is not straightforward, Jetten has said he wants to make a quick start.\n\nJetten said after the vote that never before had a party won a Dutch election with fewer than 30 seats.\n\nHe will need the support of at least three other parties to gather the 76 seats needed to form a coalition. The most obvious candidates would be the conservative-liberal VVD, the left-wing Labour (PvdA)-GreenLeft alliance and the Christian Democrats, but it could take months if that is to happen.\n\nVVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz has so far ruled out working with the left, but Jetten said he favoured a broad-based government from the centre of Dutch politics.\n\nThe weekend would be a good chance for all the parties to reflect, before a \"scout\" is given the task next Tuesday of sounding them out.\n\nJetten said he wanted to construct a coalition that represented best the millions of voters who had backed other parties to tackle the main issues, including the housing shortage and asylum and migration.\n\nHis path to victory has stunned observers. Less than two years ago he led D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - to fifth place and just nine seats.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago they were still languishing in the opinion polls, but gradually improved as Jetten put in several polished performances in TV debates and even  competed in the final of a TV quiz show 11 days before the election.\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Dick Schoof predicted on Friday that Jetten's task of forming a coalition would prove complicated. \"I reckon I'll still be prime minister at Christmas - I'd be surprised if it happened [by then]\".\n\nSchoof, a former chief of Dutch intelligence, was picked for the top job by Geert Wilders, who abandoned his bid to lead the country last year because his prospective coalition partners would not support having a far-right prime minister.\n\nWilders won the last election in November 2023, and a government was only formed in July 2024. Eleven months later, he brought his own government down, in a row with his coalition partners over asylum and migration policy."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr433x9zqq4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:22:22.188+00:00","title":"US judges say Trump administration must keep paying Snap food benefits during US shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two federal judges, in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, ruled that the Trump administration must continue paying SNAP food benefits during the ongoing government shutdown, despite claims by the USDA that emergency funds are insufficient.

judges say Trump administration must keep paying Snap food benefits during US shutdown \n\nThe Trump administration cannot suspend food aid used by more than 40 million low-income Americans amid the ongoing US government shutdown, two federal judges have ruled.\n\nThe decisions, issued within moments of each other on Friday by judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, said the government must pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap, benefits using emergency funds.\n\nThe Snap programme works by giving people reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy essential grocery items.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced this week it would not distribute food assistance funds in November due to the shutdown, saying \"the well has run dry\".\n\nA family of four on average receives $715 (£540) per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 (£4.50) per day, per person.\n\nThe states administer the benefits, using money from the federal government, which has been unfunded and shut down since 1 October.\n\nSeveral states have pledged to use their own funds to cover any shortfall, however the federal government has warned that they will not be reimbursed.\n\nHalf of US states had sued the Trump administration over its plans to halt funding, hoping to force it to use a roughly $6bn (£4.5bn) emergency contingency fund for  Snap, also known as food stamps.\n\nThe Massachusetts judge said the administration must access the contingency funding to pay the benefits and had until Monday to report back to the court on whether they will authorise at least partial benefits for November.\n\nMassachusetts US District Judge Indira Talwani wrote in her decision that the  states who sued are likely to win in court on their claim that \"Congress intended the funding of SNAP benefits, at a reduced rate if necessary, when appropriated funds prove insufficient\".\n\nJudge Talwani also wrote that the Trump administration \"erred in concluding\" that the USDA is blocked by law from tapping the emergency reserves in the contingency fund when there is a lapse in federal funding.\n\nThe USDA had said those reserves were insufficient to pay full benefits, which cost $8.5bn to $9bn each month. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had said she would only use the fund for an emergency such as a natural disaster.\n\nEven if the government turns to the contingency fund, it would only be able to cover about 60% of beneficiaries in a single month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families.\n\nJudge Talwani has asked the administration to report on Monday whether it will use the fund to pay reduced benefits or if it will pay full benefits for the month by moving money from other programmes, similar to the administration transferring military research funds earlier this month to pay members of the armed forces.\n\nSeparately in Rhode Island, a lawsuit was brought by a number of US cities and NGOs who sued over what they called the \"unlawful suspension\" of the programme.\n\n\"There is no doubt and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food, for their family,\" US  District Judge John  McConnell said.\n\nThe White House and the USDA did not comment on the decisions. The BBC has also contacted the Office of Management and Budget for comment.\n\nAt a news conference before the rulings were issued, Rollins said \"we're looking at all the options\" when asked whether the administration would comply if courts required it to release funds.\n\nOn Friday, the group behind the lawsuit filed in Rhode Island said in a statement that the ruling \"is a lifeline for millions of families, seniors, and veterans who depend on SNAP to put food on the table\".\n\n\"It reaffirms a fundamental principle: no administration can use hunger as a political weapon.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have traded blame for the federal shutdown, which will soon enter its second month, and there has not been any meaningful progress toward a deal."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50j43pp9go","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:10:19.408+00:00","title":"BBC News quiz of the week: How many years since Lily Allen last released an album?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC News quiz of the week highlights a range of current events, including Kamala Harris's potential re-election bid, King Charles III's unveiling of a memorial to LGBT+ military personnel, and a question about how many years have passed since Lily Allen last released an album.

2025-10-31T14:28:31.984+00:00\n\nTitle: Royal finances: Where does the King get his money?\n\nAndrew Mountbatten Windsor is expected to be dependent on his brother, King Charles III, for his home and money after being stripped of his \"prince\" title and asked to leave his mansion.\n\nThe King is understood to be funding Andrew's new accommodation himself and to be making \"appropriate private provision\" as he moves from Royal Lodge.\n\nThe Royal Family receives tens of millions of pounds each year from the Sovereign Grant and uses it to cover the cost of official duties, but this is not the King's only source of income.\n\nIn 2025-26, the  Sovereign Grant, which provides state funding for the monarchy, increased to £132.1m , following a sharp rise in profits for the Crown Estate.\n\nThe figure in 2024-25 was £86.3 million, for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nThat included £51.8 million for the core Sovereign Grant and £34.5 million towards the modernisation of Buckingham Palace, a 10-year £369m project.\n\nThe  Royal Household's annual financial statement  said additional income increased to £21.5m, following a record number of visitors to Buckingham Palace.\n\nPublic funding for the Royal Household has tripled  in real terms since 2012, official figures show. The Sovereign Grant was £31m per year when it was introduced in 2012.\n\nA report by the House of Commons Library said much of the increase had been driven by the Buckingham Palace project.\n\nA Palace spokesperson said: \"It has always been anticipated that the level of the Sovereign Grant will drop once the project is completed.\"\n\nProfits of the Crown Estate - a property business owned by the monarch but run independently - go to the Treasury.\n\nThe level of profit is used to calculate the funding given by the government to the Royal Family.\n\nThe Crown Estate had assets worth £15bn in 2023-24, with billions of pounds worth of properties in London, including Regent Street, as well as nearly half the land along the coast of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe estate is not the King's private property - it merely belongs to the monarch for the duration of their reign. The King cannot sell its assets or keep any profits for himself.\n\nThe Sovereign Grant was initially worth 15% of the Crown Estate profits generated two years previously. That increased to 25% in 2017-18, to help pay for the Buckingham Palace repairs, before reducing to 12% since 2024-25.\n\nHowever,  soaring profits from the Crown Estate  due to six new offshore wind farms still led to the £45m increase in the Sovereign Grant in 2025-26.\n\nUnder the Sovereign Grant Act 2011, if the Crown Estate's profits fall, the monarch still receives the same amount as the previous year, with the government making up the difference.\n\nThe UK government said that over the last 10 years, the revenue received from the Crown Estate was £5bn, which was used for public spending.\n\nThe King and other working members of the Royal Family use the money to pay for expenses related to their official duties.\n\nThe vast majority is spent on the upkeep of properties and staffing, but it also covers costs such as travel to royal engagements.\n\nMembers of the Royal Family carried out 1,900 engagements across the UK and abroad during 2024-25.\n\nMore than 93,000 guests attended 828 events at official Royal palaces, including receptions, award investitures and garden parties.\n\nThe King also receives money from a private estate called the Duchy of Lancaster, which is passed down from monarch to monarch.\n\nIt covers more than 18,000 hectares of land in areas such as Lancashire and Yorkshire, as well as property in central London.\n\nAt the end of March 2025, it was worth £679m and had made £24.4m in annual profits.\n\nWhoever holds the title of Duke of Cornwall (currently the Prince of Wales) benefits from the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nIt mainly covers land in south-west England. In the year to the end of March 2025 it had assets worth £1.1bn and had made annual profits of £22.9m.\n\nThe King and Prince William receive the profits from the duchies personally, and can spend them as they wish. However, they are not entitled to any proceeds from the sale of any estate assets, which must be reinvested.\n\nThe monarch also owns the royal palaces (which are not part of the Crown Estate) and part of the Royal Collection of art, but these do not generate income.\n\nSome palaces are looked after and funded by the Royal Family itself. Others - such as the Tower of London - are managed by Historic Royal Palaces, an independent charity.\n\nThe King also privately owns properties such as Balmoral and Sandringham.\n\nIt is understood Andrew will be relocated to the  Sandringham estate  in Norfolk, which covers approximately 8,100 hectares.\n\nIn addition, some Royal Family members have private art, jewellery and stamp collections which they can sell or use to generate income as they wish.\n\nIn 1992, Elizabeth II volunteered to pay income tax and capital gains tax on her personal income, and the King does the same.\n\nThe two duchies are exempt from corporation tax, but the King and Prince William voluntarily pay income tax on the revenue they generate. However, the amount of tax they pay is not made public.\n\nThey do not pay capital gains tax because they do not benefit personally from any increase in the duchies' assets.\n\nMembers of the Royal Family pay tax on any income generated from privately-owned assets.\n\nKing Charles does not have to pay inheritance tax on the money he received when the late queen died, under the \"sovereign to sovereign\" exemption agreed in 1993 by then Prime Minister John Major.\n\nThe Sovereign Grant does not cover the Royal Family's security arrangements, which are usually paid for by the Metropolitan Police, although the cost is not disclosed.\n\nSome major events are also not included.  The late queen's funeral in 2022 cost the government an estimated £162m .\n\nThe Coronation of the King cost taxpayers £72m, including £22m for policing.\n\nRepublic, a group campaigning for an elected head of state, has argued that factors such as security need to be included in the cost of the Royal Family.\n\nThe group claims that the total cost of the monarchy is about £510m per year."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy1n438dk4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:33:07.377+00:00","title":"The American adoptees who fear deportation to a country they can't remember","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights the growing crisis among American adoptees—particularly those adopted before 1983—who lack U.S. citizenship due to outdated adoption policies.

fear deportation to a country they can't remember\n\nShirley Chung was just a year old when she was adopted by a US family in 1966.\n\nBorn in South Korea, her birthfather was a member of the American military, who returned home soon after Shirley was born. Unable to cope, her birth mother placed her in an orphanage in the South Korean capital, Seoul.\n\n\"He abandoned us, is the nicest way I can put it,\" says Shirley, now 61.\n\nAfter around a year, Shirley was adopted by a US couple, who took her back to Texas.\n\nShirley grew up living a life similar to that of many young Americans. She went to school, got her driving licence and worked as a bartender.\n\n\"I moved and breathed and got in trouble like many teenage Americans of the 80s. I'm a child of the 80s,\" Shirley says.\n\nShirley had children, got married and became a piano teacher. Life carried on for decades with no reason to doubt her American identity.\n\nBut then in 2012, her world came crashing down.\n\nShe lost her Social Security card and needed a replacement. But when she went to her local Social Security office, Shirley was told she needed to prove her status in the country. Eventually she found out she did not have US citizenship.\n\n\"I had a little mental breakdown after finding out I wasn't a citizen,\" she says.\n\nShirley is not alone. Estimates of how many American adoptees lack citizenship  range from 18,000 to 75,000 . Some intercountry adoptees may not even know they lack US citizenship.\n\nDozens of adoptees have been deported to their countries of birth in recent years, according to the Adoptee Rights Law Center. A man born in South Korea and adopted as a child by an American family - only to be deported to his country of birth because of a criminal record - took his own life in 2017.\n\nThe reasons why so many US adoptees do not have citizenship are varied. Shirley blames her parents for failing to finalise the correct paperwork when she came to the US. She also blames the school system and the government for not highlighting that she did not have citizenship.\n\n\"I blame all the adults in my life that literally just dropped the ball and said: 'She's here in America now, she's going to be fine.'\"\n\n\"Well, am I? Am I going to be fine?\"\n\nAnother woman, who requested anonymity for fear of attracting the attention of authorities, was adopted by an American couple from Iran in 1973 when she was two years old.\n\nGrowing up in the US Midwest, she encountered some racism but generally had a happy upbringing.\n\n\"I settled into my life, always understanding that I was an American citizen. That's what I was told. I still believe that today,\" she says.\n\nBut that changed when she tried to get a passport at the age of 38 and discovered immigration authorities had lost critical documents that supported her claim to citizenship.\n\nThis has further complicated her feelings surrounding identity.\n\n\"I personally don't categorise myself as an immigrant. I didn't come here as an immigrant with a second language, a different culture, family members, ties to a country that I was born in… my culture was erased,\" she says.\n\n\"You are told that you have these rights as an American - to vote and to participate in democracy, to work, to go to school, to raise your family, to have freedoms - all these things that Americans have.\n\n\"And then all of a sudden they started pushing us into a category of immigrants, simply because they cut us from legislation. We should have all equally had citizenship rights because that was promised through adoption policies.\"\n\nFor decades, intercountry adoptions approved by courts and government agencies did not automatically guarantee US citizenship. Adoptive parents sometimes failed to secure legal status or naturalised citizenship for their children.\n\nThe Child Citizenship Act of 2000 made some headway in rectifying this, granting automatic citizenship to international adoptees. But the law only covered future adoptees or those born after February 1983. Those who arrived before then were not granted citizenship, leaving tens of thousands in limbo.\n\nAdvocates have been pushing for Congress to remove the age cut-off but these bills have failed to make it past the House.\n\nSome, like Debbie, whose two adopted children have special needs and requested that her full name not be used, have spent decades trying to secure citizenship for their dependents.\n\nShe adopted two children from an orphanage in Romania in the 1990s after watching them on Shame of a Nation - a documentary about the neglect of children in orphanages following the 1989 Romanian Revolution, that sent shockwaves around the world when it aired.\n\nThe most recent rejection of citizenship came in May, and was followed by a notice stating that if the decision was not appealed in 30 days, she would have to turn in her daughter to Homeland Security, she said.\n\n\"We'll just be lucky if they don't get picked up and deported to another country that isn't even their country of origin,\" she said.\n\nThose fears for adoptees and their families have risen even further since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a vow to remove \"promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of federal law\".\n\nLast month, the Trump administration said \"two million illegal aliens have left the United States in less than 250 days, including an estimated 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and more than 400,000 deportations\".\n\nWhile many Americans support deportations of illegal migrants, there has been uproar over some incidents.\n\nIn one case, 238 Venezuelans were deported by the US to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. They were accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang  despite most of them having no criminal records.\n\nLast month, US officials detained 475 people - more than 300 of them South Korean nationals - who they said were working illegally at Hyundai's battery facility, one of the largest foreign investment projects in Georgia.  The workers were taken away in handcuffs and chains to be detained , sparking outrage in their home country.\n\nAdoptee rights groups say they have been flooded with requests for help since Trump's return and some adoptees have gone into hiding.\n\n\"When the election results came in, it started to really cascade with requests for help,\" said Greg Luce, an attorney and founder of the Adoptee Rights Law Center, adding he's had more than 275 requests for help.\n\nThe adoptee who arrived from Iran in the 1970s said she has started avoiding certain areas, like her local Iranian supermarket, and shares an app with her friends so they always have access to her location, in case she is \"swept up\".\n\n\"At the end of the day, they don't care about your back story. They don't care that you're legally here and it's just a paperwork error. I always tell people this one single piece of paper has essentially just ruined my life,\" she said.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned right now, I feel stateless.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite adoptees being left in limbo for decades, Emily Howe, a civil and human rights attorney who has worked with adoptees across the US, believes it is just a case of political will that should unite people from across the political spectrum.\n\n\"It should be a straightforward fix: adopted children should be equal to their biological siblings of parents who were US citizens at the time of birth,\" Ms Howe said.\n\n\"The applicants have two, three, or four US citizen parents, and are now in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. We're talking about babies and toddlers who were shipped overseas through no fault of their own and lawfully admitted under US policy,\" she added.\n\n\"These are people who literally were promised that they were going to be Americans when they were two years old.\"\n\nShirley wishes she could get the US president into a room, so she and others like her could explain their stories.\n\n\"I would ask him to please have some compassion. We're not illegal aliens,\" she said.\n\n\"We were put on planes as little itty-bitty babies. Just please hear our story and please follow through with the promise that America gave each one of the babies that got on those planes: American citizenship.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/world/americas/hurricane-melissa-jamaica-flooding.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:44:14-04:00","title":"In a Jamaican Town, Melissa Leaves Floods ‘Infested’ by Dead Livestock","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded, communities in New River, St. Elizabeth parish, Jamaica, face severe flooding due to a blocked drainage system.

his storm-battered house in the New River community in St. Elizabeth parish, on Jamaica’s storm-battered southwestern coast. His home was on the other side of a large pool of chest-high water.\n\nBut he thought better of it when he saw the dead livestock.\n\n“There is a dead cow and hog; the water is starting to get infested,” he said. “The water is coming from all sides.”\n\nThree days after Hurricane Melissa roared across Jamaica, many people in communities stricken by the powerful storm find themselves trapped by floodwaters that keep rising, apparently because of a drainage system that had become blocked.\n\nThe hurricane, one of the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, ripped through several island nations, leaving behind death and widespread destruction.\n\nAt least 19 people were killed in Jamaica, and at least 30, including children, in Haiti, officials said. Jamaican officials said they expected the death toll to climb as the authorities reached and searched through the worst hit areas.\n\nThe Jamaican authorities would be “all-hands on deck” to help the country recover from “unimaginable” devastation, the country’s information minister, Dana Morris Dixon, said at a news conference.\n\nIn New River, where there was still no power on Friday, residents said they thought the worst of the storm was behind them — until the water started coming. Water began seeping into people’s homes two days ago and started rising considerably again on Friday, residents said.\n\nAt the height of the storm, one person said, the wind kept peeling the roofs off homes, forcing people to run from house to house in search of safe shelter.\n\nBefore the storm, Mr. Beck said, he had been boarding up windows at a local infirmary, and ended up riding out the storm there.\n\nWhen he was able to get back to his home, he said, the roof had been torn off.\n\n“My house is rubbish,” Mr. Beck said.\n\nReginald Campbell, 64, dragged cushions and mattresses into the sunlight from his flooded house.\n\n“I am trying to get some sun on it because it is starting to stink,” he shouted from his porch, which was surrounded by water.\n\nMr. Campbell said the blocked drainage system was causing the water to keep rising.\n\n“We are anxious,” he said.\n\nElsewhere, a man with a chain saw tackled a palm tree that had fallen across his front yard. He climbed another tree that had power lines draped across it, trying to cut it down.\n\nAbout 2,000 feet down the road, drone footage of the area showed the dead cow and pig that had given Mr. Beck pause. People in houses with roofs torn off peeked through windows in homes surrounded by water. Those with a bit of exposed land had scattered their belongings outside to try to dry them in the sun.\n\nTwo little boys, one barefoot and both shirtless, walked down the street carrying their belongings in plastic bags on their heads. They reached a large pool of water and debated going further.\n\nThey waded through the knee-high water.\n\nWeston Brown, who works as an embalmer for funeral homes, drove to check the conditions at the Bailey Parlor funeral home, which had part of its roof torn off.\n\nMr. Brown was certain that the death toll would rise, as the authorities received more and more reports of bodies deteriorating inside homes.\n\n“We are going to have more people dying,” he said. “People are going to start dying from hunger.”\n\nEmiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/upshot/snap-food-shutdown-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:27:07-04:00","title":"Who Will Be Affected by Disruptions to Federal Food Aid","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which serves nearly 42 million Americans, is at the center of a major legal and political conflict during a government shutdown.

2025-10-31T17:13:09.441+00:00\n\nTitle: Canada Prime Minister Carney to visit Xi Jinping in China, marking 'turning point' \n\nCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney accepted an invitation to visit China extended by President Xi Jinping, signalling a \"turning point\" in the countries' relationship.\n\nThe invite came after the two leaders met for 40 minutes on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on Friday. It was the first meeting between a Canadian prime minister and the Chinese president since 2017.\n\nThe countries have had a strained relationship since a diplomatic row in 2018 and been locked in a trade dispute since 2024.\n\nBut as trade tensions between Canada and the US continue to rise, Carney has said the country will turn to strengthening its ties with other major economies.\n\nHe has signalled his desire to double Canada's non-US exports in the next decade, in response to President Donald Trump placing punishing tariffs on Canadian goods and some of its critical sectors.\n\nThat includes closer trade ties with  \"the economic giants of Asia\", Carney said last week.\n\nSpeaking briefly to reporters after his meeting with Xi on Friday, Carney said he believes Canada and China have hit a \"turning point\" in relations that will yield positive developments for the Canadian economy.\n\n\"Distance is not the way to solve problems, not the way to serve our people,\" the prime minister said.\n\nIn his own remarks, Xi said \"China is willing to work with Canada to push China-Canada relations back onto a healthy, stable, and sustainable correct track\" that benefits both countries.\n\nThe two leaders directed their officials \"to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants,\" according to a readout released by Carney's office after the meeting.\n\nA trade dispute  has been escalating since Canada placed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) in October 2024, mirroring similar action by the US. Later that same month, Canada placed a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminium.\n\nChina retaliated in March by imposing tariffs on several Canadian agricultural products, including a 76% levy on Canadian canola seed imports and a 100% levy on canola oil, meal and peas.\n\nThese measures have hurt farmers in the western part of the Canada, as China is by far the largest importer of the country's canola seeds.\n\nSome western provincial premiers, including Wab Kinew of Manitoba and Scott Moe of Saskatchewan, have since called on the federal government to drop tariffs on Chinese EVs. Kinew said earlier this month that Canada has now found itself in a \"two-front trade war\" with its two largest trading partners — the US and China.\n\nSeparately, the US has imposed a 35% tariff on all Canadian goods not covered by an existing free trade agreement, as well as a 50% levy on steel and aluminium and a 25% levy on automobiles.\n\nLast week, US-Canada relations hit a new low after Trump suspended all trade talks over an anti-tariff advertisement run by Ontario Premier Doug Ford that featured an address on free trade by former US president Ronald Reagan.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said the two countries will not restart trade talks.\n\nTrump has also threatened to raise tariffs on Canada another 10%, though it is unclear if and when that would come into effect.\n\nPrior to the tariffs, Canada-China relations were already reeling from a diplomatic row that resulted in Beijing detaining two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovring.\n\nThe two were accused by China of espionage and were taken into custody in 2018. Their arrest came days after Canada detained Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese technology executive and chief financial officer of Huawei, at the request of the US.\n\nAll three were subsequently released in 2021 after the US Department of Justice dropped an extradition request for Ms Wanzhou on charges of fraud.\n\nChina was also one of the countries called out for possibly meddling in Canada's 2019 and 2021 elections, prompting a Canadian public inquiry into foreign interference. That inquiry concluded that attempts by foreign states to meddle in recent elections were \"troubling\" but had \"minimal impact\".\n\nChina has denied any allegations of meddling.\n\nCarney's APEC meeting with Xi in South Korea comes one day after the Chinese president met with Donald Trump - the first between the two in six years.\n\nIn that Thursday meeting, Xi and Trump agreed to dial back their countries' trade war. No formal agreement has been signed, but the two signalled they are closer to a deal that would lower tariffs."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/world/africa/darfur-sudan-atrocities.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:01:31-04:00","title":"Twenty Years On, Darfur Tips Into Chaos Again","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two decades after the Darfur conflict brought global attention to ethnic violence and humanitarian crises, the region is again engulfed in chaos.

After not finding any survivor, the Navy said it planned to stop actively searching on Saturday morning, in accordance with typical practices of a 96-hour search.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard said on Friday that the strikes occurred on Monday afternoon. It was unclear exactly when U.S. officials alerted Mexico of the person clinging to the wreckage.\n\nThe Coast Guard said it received word from the Mexican Navy on Tuesday afternoon that it had not found any survivors. The Coast Guard and the Pentagon referred further questions to Mexican officials.\n\nIn announcing the round of three deadly strikes on four boats on social media on Tuesday, Mr. Hegseth said that a “total of 14 narco-terrorists were killed during the three strikes, with one survivor.”\n\n“All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed,” he said, adding that Mexican search-and-rescue authorities had “accepted the case and assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue.”\n\nThe Pentagon statement on Friday said the U.S. forces acted “in accordance with international protocols for a distressed person in the water” and “relayed the precise location and status of the person in the water” to a Mexican military aircraft that was operating nearby.\n\nSince late August, the U.S. military has deployed about 10,000 troops to the Caribbean, about half of them on eight warships and half in Puerto Rico, for what the administration says is a counterterrorism and counternarcotics mission. Mr. Hegseth last week also ordered the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford to Latin America from the Mediterranean. The Ford carries about 5,000 sailors and has more than 75 attack, surveillance and support aircraft, including F/A-18 fighters.\n\nIn his social media post on Tuesday, Mr. Hegseth compared the strikes against the boats to America’s wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan over more than two decades.\n\nBut a broad range of outside experts in laws governing the use of armed force have said the campaign is illegal because the military is not permitted to deliberately target civilians — even criminal suspects — who are not directly participating in armed hostilities.\n\nThe Trump administration has asserted that the president has the power to “determine,” without any authorization from Congress, that drug cartels and those who work for them are enemy combatants.\n\nMr. Trump has falsely asserted that each destroyed boat saves 25,000 American lives. In reality, about 100,000 Americans die each year from drug overdoses, but most of those deaths are from fentanyl, which comes from labs in Mexico. South America produces cocaine.\n\nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico has criticized the attacks, suggesting they violate international treaties. She said Mexico’s foreign minister met with the U.S. ambassador to Mexico this week in part to discuss the issue, and on Friday, the head of Mexico’s Navy was set to talk with Coast Guard officials about the strikes.\n\nMexican officials have felt especially uneasy about the Trump administration’s willingness to use military force against what it calls “narcoterrorists” because some of the most powerful drug cartels are based in Mexico and are the sources of most of the fentanyl in the United States.\n\nMr. Trump has suggested that he would like to use military force against Mexican cartels. Ms. Sheinbaum has strongly rejected that idea and, for now, it appears that U.S. and Mexican officials are largely satisfied with their cooperation to combat the gangs.\n\nBipartisan frustration over the administration’s failure to provide detailed information about the strikes and their legal underpinnings is mounting on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn Friday, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee released two letters they had sent to Mr. Hegseth in recent weeks requesting the specific military orders as well as detailed legal rationale for the Pentagon’s operations against what it says are drug trafficking cartels in the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific.\n\nThe senators, Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, and Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said they had also requested any written opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel regarding the domestic or international legal basis for the military operations.\n\nThey asked for a complete list of all designated terrorist organizations and drug trafficking organizations with whom Mr. Trump has asserted the United States is engaged in armed conflict.\n\n“To date, these documents have not been submitted,” the committee said in a statement on Friday.\n\nEric Schmitt contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/magazine/frankenstein-guillermo-del-toro-shelley.html","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Quantum Computing Breakthrough: New Error Correction Method Achieves Significant Progress in Stability and Reliability","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major breakthrough has been achieved in the field of quantum computing, specifically in the area of error correction.

What Does It Show Us Now?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T05:01:21-04:00\n\nIt is, perhaps, the most famous origin story in literature, and it begins with blood-red snow falling from the sky. The year 1816 brought forth freakish weather set off by the explosion of a volcano in Indonesia. Blizzards battered New England in June. Rivers swelled and filled with the bodies of drowned animals. Crops failed, hay rotted, typhus raged. In Paris, the pamphleteers warned of the end of the world.\n\nIn Switzerland, near Lake Geneva, heavy summer rains forced a group of friends to huddle indoors at the Villa Diodati. To amuse themselves, they competed to see who could come up with the most terrifying tale. Their little circle had been named “the league of incest” by the British press, not entirely without reason. Among their ranks was “mad, bad” Lord Byron, who was said to have gotten a touch too close to a half sister. Also in residence: the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and a young woman who was decidedly not the very pregnant Mrs. Shelley. This pale girl of 18 with a bright blaze of hair and a new baby in her arms (Percy’s) was Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin.\n\nThe Villa Diodati still stands, looking like a slice of wedding cake among the tall trees. It appears to bear no mark of its history, of the evening Mary reported a curious waking dream: “I saw — with shut eyes, but acute mental vision — I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half-vital motion.”\n\nOut of that initial vision emerged “Frankenstein,” the tale of a young scientist intent upon discovering the secret of life. He collects body parts from the charnel houses, stitches them together and by mysterious means animates his creation. Mary filled 11 notebooks with a strong, slanted hand that races down the page, the words tipping so close to the line that they look driven by a strong wind. It is a book full of rain, full of the storms and electricity in the air — the theories of galvanism, the stirrings of the abolitionist movement — all of which its young author followed keenly.\n\nThe novel is made up of three autobiographies, each one nested in another, like a set of Russian dolls — of the sea explorer Robert Walton, the scientist Victor Frankenstein and Victor’s creature. We begin at sea, with Robert, who has embarked on an expedition to the North Pole when he comes across Victor, battered and close to death. He has been hunting and trying to kill his creature, who has turned deadly.\n\nIt is the creature’s account, his eloquence, that lies at the heart of the book. His story begins with the very kindling of his consciousness — we encounter, perhaps for the first time in literature, the memoir of an infant. He narrates how his senses were, at first, deliriously muddled, how he came to identify them, to name cold and pain. He realizes he is alone, and he cries. Abandoned, he wanders. He finds a place to conceal himself, where he can spy on a family. Watching them, he is comforted; he learns to speak, to read. He understands what he is.\n\nHe tracks down his maker, pleads for a companion, some creature like him, to ease his loneliness. Victor agrees to make him a mate, but he feels a sudden revulsion and tears the female monster’s body to pieces. Mad with grief, the creature destroys nearly every person Victor loves. At the end of the novel, Victor dies on the ship. The creature comes aboard, mourns him and wanders away, to prepare his own pyre.\n\n“Frankenstein” is a book about the mystery of creation — but what accounts for its own, this strange and desolate work of the imagination? Mary herself addressed this question in the introduction to the 1831 edition; how did she, a teenage girl who never had a day of formal schooling, “dilate upon so very hideous an idea”? And what accounts for its longevity? Byron and Percy Shelley feel like relics, but Mary’s work is still read, recast, passionately debated. Reportedly the most assigned college text in the United States, “Frankenstein” has been hailed as revolutionary and reactionary, feminist and drearily misogynist. It is interpreted as thinly veiled autobiography, a warning against scientific hubris, a critique of the French Revolution. It has been described as a book about fathers and sons but also might be read as the keenest expression of a daughter’s longing for her mother.\n\nThe creature appears in at least 400 films, and this season brings another, “Frankenstein,” from Guillermo del Toro, the Oscar-winning director of “The Shape of Water.” It is the movie he has been trying to make his entire career. “My Everest,” he calls it. “Every movie I’ve done is the training wheels for this one.”\n\n“Frankenstein” is a story famous for its depiction of the anxiety of creation, but its endurance comes from its own vibrating strangeness, the swivel of its sympathy between creator and creature, father and son. To bring Mary Shelley’s monster back to life, some 200 years later, del Toro had to plumb the past — hers and his own. “It’s like mudlarking in the Thames,” he told me. “Everything that is worth finding is at the bottom. There is a dense layer of tarlike mud in which she has buried her mother, feeling despised by her father, hated by her stepmother, all these things are there.” Shelley has her scientist animate the scraps of corpses to show us what we already know and pointedly avoid: how the dead walk among us and ghosts can edge out the living, how we struggle to emerge from the long, obliterating shadows of our origins.\n\nThe first time I met Mary Shelley, she was wearing a crisp white nightgown, with her bright hair brushed back over her brow. She was sitting at her desk — pen lifted, midthought — in waxen reverie, as del Toro knelt before her to delicately adjust the pillow beneath her bare feet.\n\nThis life-size silicone statue of Shelley occupies a large room on the second floor of a home in Santa Monica, Calif., that del Toro uses to store and display a vast collection of sculptures, specimens and props from his films. He calls it Bleak House, and like Dickens’s original, it is “delightfully irregular,” full of wandering little arteries of passageways and hidden rooms, stuffed with skeletons, Pinocchio puppets, family portraits (del Toro as a child, pretending to drink his sister’s blood), 13 separate libraries (e.g., fairy tales, forensics, horror), models of babies floating serenely in jars.\n\nOn the wall is a framed paint brush that once belonged to James Whale, who directed the classic “Frankenstein” (1931), starring Boris Karloff, responsible for the monster in our minds — the bolts in the neck, the animal way of moving, the muteness. There is a life-size statue of Karloff himself, sitting shirtless in a barber chair, having his makeup applied, while drinking a cup of tea, a small stain of black lipstick on the rim.\n\nDel Toro saw the 1931 film as a monster-mad child, and when Karloff’s face filled the screen, he was transfixed. “That is my Jesus,” he thought. “That is my patron saint.” He saw himself in the creature’s innocence and awkwardness and ill-fitting suit; he saw the Catholic martyrs in the heavy-lidded eyes rolling back, as if in ecstasy.\n\nMuch has been written about how that particular production itself brought together a group of outsiders, how they might have encoded their own alienation into the film — many of them were immigrants, the director was gay and Karloff himself concealed his Anglo-Indian ancestry. Del Toro, too, felt like an outsider. He was bullied mercilessly for growing up blond and wispy, “like little Lord Fauntleroy,” in Guadalajara, Mexico. The monsters he obsessively drew sanctified imperfection, offered some respite from oppressive “mandatory beauty.” They made it acceptable to be hairy, to have crooked teeth, to feel a bit shy, to disappoint.\n\n“I think that ‘Frankenstein’ is maybe the first moment in which we recognize ourselves in the monster,” del Toro told me. “The monstrous and the demonic and terrifying narratives prior to ‘Frankenstein’ were mostly outside forces coming after us. Most of them had a Judeo-Christian sense of good and evil: We were good; the things that were coming after us were evil.”\n\nWe were sitting in the illustration library, talking across the cleared corner of a table, the other half laden with papers, props, figurines, an empty vitrine. He fiddled with a small skull as we spoke. In person, he is gentle and gregarious in his customary black hoodie and the circular, wire-rimmed glasses that seem to magnify his huge blue eyes. He is prone to enveloping hugs, to clapping you on the shoulder with such verve that you will drop everything you are holding, to crying while watching his own films. His sets are said to be joyful places. There are no secrets, says Oscar Isaac, who plays Victor Frankenstein in the new film. “I like it!” del Toro will roar when a shot pleases him; if not, merrily, “That was shit!”\n\nWhen we met, in late summer, he was finalizing the cut of the film. Although deeply influenced by James Whale’s interpretation, his own version returns the story to its roots, to Villa Diodati. There are three editions of the novel: the 1818 version (published anonymously in three volumes, albeit heavily edited by Percy Bysshe Shelley, who tried to “elevate” the language), the 1823 version (published under Mary Shelley’s name and edited by her father; for a time the most commonly read edition), the 1831 version (edited by Mary Shelley in light of public criticism and tamed into lifelessness; avoid).\n\nDel Toro’s interest, however, lies in another document. It is the manuscript he is most drawn to, the original text that Mary began writing as an 18-year-old — the “most impulsive and the least ‘organized’” of the bunch, he calls it. It is the purest distillation of her voice and intentions, before she added the heavy allusions to “Paradise Lost” that mark the published editions. “What I love is the way a teenager asks questions,” he said. “I don’t need John Milton superimposed upon that.” Who else but a teenager could pose the creature’s questions with such raw fury and need: “Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination?”\n\nDel Toro takes considerable liberties with the plot — his creature is immortal; he introduces a love triangle, of sorts. It’s the spirit of the text that interests him, not fidelity. “A text is like a house; you have to move in,” del Toro told me. “What I can do is have the same urgency from my own questions that she had. And use the same questions to interrogate my own biography, which is that I’m the son of a man that tried to learn to be a father, and I tried to learn to be a father.”\n\nThe film explains Victor’s cruelty by giving him a cruel father of his own, a doctor who spits his son’s name with contempt and whips his face for making mistakes at his lessons. When Victor’s mother dies in childbirth, he holds his father responsible for not saving her. His scientific ambition is competitive, to bring life forth where his father failed.\n\nIn the novel, Victor is repelled by the creature’s ugliness — the “shriveled complexion, and straight black lips.” But del Toro, who got his start doing monster makeup, wanted to make the creature beautiful. Played by Jacob Elordi, who studied infant development and Butoh movement for the role, his motions are languid. Like a baby, he is entranced by his own hands; when tied up, he plays with his chains. His skin is not the brutal patchwork of sutures, as often depicted, in the 1994 Kenneth Branagh version, for example, but reminiscent of cracked porcelain, almost kintsugi — the Japanese art of pottery repair, in which gold or silver lacquer is used to accentuate the breaks.\n\nIn the film, Victor is dazzled by his creation. He flings open the shutters and lets light fall on the creature’s body; he demonstrates how to take in its warmth. “Sun, sun!” Victor cries (although it very well could be “Son, son”). It is only later that he will grow frustrated with the creature. It won’t learn fast enough; it whimpers. Victor will mock and taunt him, beat him. But not yet; in that first meeting, he touches his creature with wonder.\n\nUntil now, del Toro’s films have hewed to a tidy moral calculus. The villain is invariably the beautiful man in the nice suit, the one with the sharp part in his hair and the shiny boots. He torments the vulnerable within reach — his wife, children, subordinates — but his threat looms larger; we are led to look at how the desire to contain fear or conceal weakness can become an impulse toward power and control. Del Toro’s heroes are virtuous, bruised, misunderstood — innocents who possess little language and a great spiritual power.\n\nBut in “Frankenstein,” we feel the effort to embody both father and son more completely, to sympathize with them. In his own life, del Toro told me, “I was so busy being a son, I did not realize I was a father.” (He has two daughters, in their 20s.) Victor is endowed with a tragic back story and somewhat exonerated; the creature is given a taste for violence and lightly indicted. This is the complexity of the original text speaking through the film; in the novel, the creature describes his pleasure in killing a child. “We can’t deny the rage of the creature,” del Toro said. “In the past, I would have made him superior to human beings.”\n\nInstead, the film has Victor and his creature double and overlap; they invite the question: Who is the monster?\n\nThe walls of Bleak House are painted a dark, internal shade of red — earthy, with a touch of rust. The color follows you — it’s the color of the binding of del Toro’s childhood encyclopedias and the ink in his journals. It finds an echo upstairs, in Mary Shelley’s neatly combed russet hair. When he showed me the room in which he writes — warm and dim and pulsing with the gentle rumbling of a recorded storm — I teased him: “This is a womb. You have returned to the womb.”\n\n“You can really bloom here,” he responded happily, turning a little figurine on a shelf to display it at a more becoming angle. “Like a hydroponic plant.”\n\nWhen del Toro was a child, his father won the lottery. The family moved into a bright white, very modern mansion, but he spent as much time as he could with his great-aunts in a wonderfully old and spooky home, full of sighing ghosts and visitations. He had waking dreams of goatlike creatures emerging from the wardrobe (he would recreate the scene in “Pan’s Labyrinth”). The great-aunts fussed over and tormented him in turn; one put bottle caps in his shoes, telling him that suffering was a fast-track to penance, which came to a stop only when his mother discovered his bloody socks. His father was perplexed by his introverted, bookish son and seemed to prefer the company of his older, athletic brother. But his mother was a soul mate of a kind — “a bit of witch.” They wrote poetry together, and she taught him to read tarot.\n\nShe was a woman of great imagination and intuition, but “her life was made of regret,” del Toro told me. Her own mother had died giving birth to her. Her father remarried but never recovered. He made his wife a saint and prayed to her. He was never fully sober again. How could the daughter not regard herself as the instrument of his loss? She lived in tentative possession of her own life, which had taken her mother’s. She could not step out of the shadow of her mother, nor could she fight it. Her own motherhood was fraught — she suffered stillbirths and miscarriages, terrible experiences that del Toro recalls learning about as a child.\n\nListening to him, I had the odd feeling of already knowing this history even though I had not heard it before. He is a filmmaker who nurtures recurring motifs: twisted trees, underground caverns, damaged eyes, enchanted books. Above all there is the figure of a woman who dies in childbirth. A woman in a nightgown who stands up suddenly and is bleeding; babies who are born wrong or too soon. There is an obsessive attentiveness to the precariousness of birth.\n\n“Mary and I have a shorter gap spiritually than you think,” del Toro says. For whose story is this but Mary Shelley’s? Her own mother was Mary Wollstonecraft, one of the principal forerunners of modern feminism and an iconoclast in her time, who spoke and loved freely. She sickened quickly after giving birth to Mary. She could not pass the placenta. A doctor was sent for; he reached into her body and pulled it out, piece by agonizing piece. (Impossible not to link those torn pieces of flesh to Victor assembling his creature.) Puppies were brought to latch at her breasts to draw the milk away for fear it was infected. She died when Mary was not 10 days old.\n\nHer husband, the political philosopher William Godwin, bereft, raised the girl in the shadow of her illustrious mother. He taught her to read, the story goes, by tracing the letters in her mother’s headstone. Mary’s own years bearing children were marked by tragic loss. By age 21, she had married Percy Shelley, borne three children and lost two of them. “Dream that my little baby came to life again,” Mary wrote in her journal in 1815 after losing her first child; “that it had only been cold, and that we rubbed it before the fire, and it lived. Awake and find no baby. I think about the little thing all day.”\n\nCuriously, there are no mothers in “Frankenstein.” The creature is born out of a man’s scientific ambition, not a woman’s body. The family the creature spies on is missing a mother as well; so is Victor’s betrothed. I have never understood this dogged slaughter of mothers in Shelley’s fiction (motherless characters are common in her subsequent books as well), until del Toro told me of his own mother’s story, how she was blotted out by her mother’s ghost. Absence is more powerful than presence, he explained to me. “Presence is fleeting. Absence is eternal.”\n\nThe figure of the dead mother is deep in our DNA, almost a precondition for narrative. Every culture produces ghosts in their own image to reflect their own fears and taboos. But she is found everywhere — a ghost representing a woman who died in childbirth: the Japanese ubume, soaked in blood from the waist down, or the churail, as she is known in India, with her backward turned feet and long unkempt hair, said to lurk at crossroads and burial grounds and (horrifyingly to me as a small child) near toilets. Or consider the missing mothers in fairy tales and children’s literature.\n\nI used to think of the missing mother as precondition for story because only when she — with her penchant for safety and order — was banished could the adventure begin. The opposite might be true: The story coalesces around her lack — preserves it; the adventure leads not away but toward her radiant absence.\n\nHow do you depict such absence in film? How can we see that the missing mother saturates everything she has left behind? In del Toro’s “Frankenstein,” Victor’s mother is introduced to us wearing a trailing red veil. When she goes into labor, she reaches for her son with a bloody hand, marking him. After her death, red creeps into his costumes — specifically in his red leather gloves — everything he touches, we see, is stained with her loss. In del Toro’s films, the urge to narrate is always knotted together with a maternal body that holds life and death. In his telling, every story is, at its heart, the story of return.\n\nWhat makes a monster? Every new version of “Frankenstein” must answer this question for itself. In “Presumption! or the Fate of Frankenstein,” the 1823 play that made the story famous (the novel itself sold poorly), the creature is blue-skinned and wild-eyed. Before he even steps onstage, his unnatural creation has been commented upon — Victor is said to be raising the devil. As soon as he bounds onstage, he is perceived as murderous and powerful, snapping his creator’s sword in two. It’s a softer creature we encounter in the Karloff film, but his monstrosity is also inborn. The doctor’s bumbling assistant breaks into a university classroom and steals the wrong brain — an abnormal, criminal brain — to complete the creature.\n\nIn the novel itself, the monster is not born but made — by Victor’s revulsion, his abandonment, his refusal to care for that which he has created. Victor himself experiences brief and awful flashes of guilt. Mary makes a transitive verb out of the word “compassionate.” Listening to the creature’s account, Victor registers that “his words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him, and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.”\n\nThere are many wounded and hurt children in literature — Dickens’s orphans, Nabokov’s nymphets — but none speaks so clearly, makes their accusations as forcefully as the creature. “Hear my tale,” he insists when at last face to face with his creator. His plaint feels like the basis of so much modern memoir — hear what I have endured. There is an implicit faith in the act of giving one’s testimony, the hope that finding the precise language for pain (“How can I move thee?” the creature asks) might bring forth redress. What feels almost unbearable in his account, even now, is not the injustice he reports, but his need for his creator despite it all. “I am thy creature,” he says. “You my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures, who owe me nothing?”\n\nDestroy me, the creature says, but hear me first, “and then, if you can and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.” Victor, in turn, curses those hands; he cries out for relief from the sight of this “detested form.” And the creature reaches out to cover Victor’s eyes with his own hands, to spare his creator the sight of himself — “Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he says, “thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor.” His tale is the story of the unrequited love of the child for the parent — the shame of dependency; the bottomless, almost perplexing willingness to forgive.\n\nPercy Shelley made the fewest edits to this section. It is mostly Mary, alone on the page — that strong, sloping hand. It is the closest, I think, that we can come to hearing her real voice. She is a writer easy to speak for, easy to claim, because she remains so difficult to find. As a child, she reportedly hid behind the sofa when company came, to eavesdrop (much like her creature). The “cold chaste moon” in Percy’s poetry supposedly refers to her, as if her natural tendency was to reflect, not make her own light. As a writer she hid expertly, too, behind the overlapping testimonies of the characters in this book, through whom she titrated the details of her life.\n\nHer journals, especially in her later years, are laconic. The later entries read as if she were trying to erase herself in real time, as if baffled to find herself alive. For she outlived everyone, starting with her mother. Her half sister overdosed on laudanum. Percy’s first wife drowned herself. Percy drowned too, in a sailing accident, not six years into their marriage. Byron died shortly after, of fever in Greece. Only one of her four children survived into adulthood, and he, famously dull. She wrote in her journal, “Seule avec mes tristes souvenirs” (Alone with my sad memories).\n\nThere is a mystery in those journals that has long preoccupied scholars. Mary was in the habit of noting daily activities: “1st March Nurse the baby, read ‘Corinne,’ and work.” What does it mean when she indicates that she “worked”? “Work” is noted as distinct from “writing” or “translating,” which she specified explicitly. It is unlikely to refer to housework, because housework would not occur in bursts and then vanish for long periods as “work” does. “Work” erupts unpredictably, at moments when the Shelleys were scrambling for money but also when they could afford a maid; “work” happened in company and did not require solitude, unlike writing, which did. Comparing these dates with Mary’s biography, the historian Nora Crook offered a theory. “Work” might mean “sewing,” for its dates correspond with pregnancies, when layettes and maternity clothes would need to be made, and with other points when clothes needed to be replaced, when worn out or ruined after breastfeeding. “Work,” Crook noticed, corresponded with times of grief, too — when new mourning clothes had to be stitched.\n\nEvery work of art is, in some way, about its own creation. Del Toro has always been confused about why the creature’s body had to be made of scraps of corpses. If Victor was so brilliant and could animate flesh, why couldn’t he reanimate an intact body? But this was Shelley’s “work,” in every sense, the piecing and patching together of parts, of sewing the clothes that might bear a body through new life and death, of weaving a story capacious enough to contain her prodigious self-education, the pain of losing her children, her mother’s absence, her father’s abandonment, the exhilaration of thinking alongside her husband and friends. She draws together these strands into unity, stitching them a story of loneliness, vengeance and the possibilities for repair.\n\nHer sure hands pull the plot very taut at the end. In the final scenes, as creature and creator hunt each other across the Arctic, what does the creature do but leave food for Victor — he nourishes his tormentor. Mary Shelley, let us recall, dedicated this novel to the father who had rejected her for running away with Percy Shelley; the father who sent her stepsister to school but kept her home; the father she would support financially for the rest of his life.\n\nAt the end of the novel, the creature is profoundly alone, mourning his creator, preparing to die himself. He evokes Mary Shelley on the stage of her own life, littered with the bodies of her children, her half sister, her husband. She wondered if, in conjuring such loss and loneliness, she had prophesied her own; it might be one explanation for her retreat from the intensity of the imaginative world of “Frankenstein,” why nothing she wrote could match it. “The novel ends up in a really bleak romantic existentialism. And I wanted to end with Frankenstein accepting the son, with the Catholic idea that forgiveness liberates everybody,” del Toro told me, and then put his own spin on a Borges quote: “To forgive is the greatest of gifts or the most violent of punishments.” In the film, there is an embrace, a moment of mutual recognition — and yet something ambiguous lingers.\n\nAfter walking away, into the sun, del Toro’s creature bows his head — a moment signaling acceptance of his fate, I think. But I wonder if he is remembering, as we are, the morning of his birth, when his creator showed him the same sun, showed him how to take its warmth, those few, fleeting days when he was the source of only wonderment and pride. There is fresh pain in store, none keener than remembering yourself beloved. Is it the cruelty that makes the monster or is it the longing?\n\nPhoto illustration: Prop stylist: Heather Greene.

is of his own making, but it has had a profound impact on his immediate family: his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, and their two daughters.\n\nMs Ferguson, 66,  has been haunted by her own links  with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nShe will now move out of Royal Lodge and will make her own living arrangements, although it's believed she won't be moving to Sandringham in Norfolk with Andrew.\n\nPrincesses Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, will retain their titles, as they are the daughters of the son of a Sovereign.\n\nBut questions have also been raised about whether they can disentangle themselves from their parents' mess.\n\nMs Ferguson, who lost her duchess title when Andrew gave up his Duke of York title a few weeks ago, had, until recently, sidestepped the firing line of the controversy around Epstein.\n\nBut in September,  several charities dropped her as patron or ambassador  after the emergence of an email from 2011 in which she called Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.\n\nThe only charity she is still linked with is her own foundation, Sarah's Trust.\n\nIt used to have a \"duchess collection\" - a range of products including tea and biscuit sets to raise funds for the charity - but the website for that is no longer active.\n\nIts causes include supporting vulnerable communities, including \"forgotten women\" globally.\n\nBBC News has made multiple attempts to contact the charity to ask if such a cause is appropriate given Ms Ferguson's ties to Epstein. But the phone number listed is not recognised, and emails bounced back.\n\nWe raised this with the Charity Commission, who said one of its team has been in touch with the charity reminding it to keep their contact details up to date.\n\nAway from her philanthropy, Ms Ferguson has various business ventures, and has written several children's books, non-fiction about Queen Victoria, and her own memoirs.\n\nHer latest children's book, which was due to be published on 9 October according to a press release in Bookseller, is now showing as available from 28 November on Amazon.\n\nWaterstones bookstores told BBC News that the publication date for Flora And Fern: Kindness Along The Way, had \"moved\" and that they didn't have a new publication date.\n\nHer publisher, New Frontier Publishing, has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nHowever, one industry source told the BBC that \"it would be an entirely sensible decision\" to delay publication.\n\nMs Ferguson's other publishers have remained tight-lipped when asked whether they plan to sever links with her.\n\nHarper Collins, which has published two of her titles, the most recent being A Most Intriguing Lady which came out in 2023, declined to comment but pointed to the fact that both her books remain in print and available.\n\n\"Publishers don't tend to drop authors, they just quietly don't renew contracts,\" said Neill Denny, editor of the book trade news website Book Brunch.\n\nHe said that while there has been speculation that Ms Ferguson, or indeed Andrew, could write a tell-all memoir, \"I think the publishers would be wary of taking on the ex Duchess of York's story.\"\n\nAs for Beatrice and Eugenie, they have kept their princess title - which will be a small victory for Andrew, who will have wanted to protect his daughters, even at his own expense.\n\nBoth appear to have escaped the UK this week.\n\nBeatrice was pictured at an investment summit in Saudi Arabia. Her family have long-held links to the Middle East and she also recently appeared in a promotional picture  for a UAE bank .\n\nMeanwhile, Eugenie was pictured in Paris with friends.\n\nAnd while there has been some sympathy for the princesses, they also haven't been able to completely avoid the scandals around their parents.\n\nEarlier this week, a picture resurfaced  showing Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Harvey Weinstein  at Beatrice's 18th birthday party in Windsor.\n\nThe Telegraph also reported a leaked email from Epstein to his UK-based lawyer that suggested Ms Ferguson and the princesses visited Epstein in New York after he was released from prison in 2009.\n\nA source close to Ms Ferguson insisted that neither she nor her daughters had any recollection of such a visit,  according to the newspaper .\n\nIn 2018, Beatrice  told British Vogue in a joint interview  with her sister: \"We are young women trying to build careers and have personal lives, and we're also princesses and doing all of this in the public eye.\"\n\nThe princesses are not working royals, and both have jobs - Beatrice founded advisory firm BY-Eq, while Eugenie works at the gallery Hauser & Wirth.\n\nBoth are married with children, with Beatrice splitting her time between her Cotswolds property and an apartment in St James' Palace. Eugenie lives between Portugal and a property in the grounds of Kensington Palace.\n\nOn Friday night, royal sources said the late Queen's corgis are still going to be looked after by Andrew, Sarah and their daughters - although it's uncertain whose home they will reside in.\n\nBoth princesses also have their philanthropic endeavours. Eugenie set up the anti-slavery collective, a charity whose focus includes victims of sex trafficking. According to the most recently available accounts, it has raised £1.5m in donations last year but has so far distributed very little, with £1.3m carried forward.\n\nBBC News approached the charity to ask for a comment in light of the latest controversy surrounding Andrew and Epstein, but it has not responded.\n\nAt the end of this tumultuous week, there are still many unanswered questions.\n\nFamily time will clearly be harder now. Andrew is moving to Norfolk, which means he is no longer close by to his daughters and grandchildren.\n\nMs Ferguson - who maintained a close relationship with Andrew and lived at Royal Lodge with him, despite their divorce in 1996 - will also now move, although it's unclear where.\n\nShe recently sold her Belgravia flat, which she purchased for £4.2m. It is still listed in her name on Land Registry records, but her spokesperson confirmed to BBC News that the sale has gone through.\n\nAnd then there's a question mark over Christmas.\n\nIt's been previously announced that Andrew would be excluded from the traditional royal family gathering which takes place in Sandringham at Christmas.\n\nWhere Ms Ferguson will be is also not clear.\n\nBut either way, the princesses will face a choice, whether to spend it with their parents, their in-laws, or the wider Royal Family.\n\nWhat they decide may be telling. With the York brand now tainted beyond repair, who they choose to celebrate with may be a sign of who they will align with in future."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/elections-new-jersey-california-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"18:16:16-04:00","title":"What Tuesday’s Elections Might Tell Us About Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes Tuesday’s U.S. elections as a key indicator of political trends following Donald Trump’s narrow 2024 loss.

Trump\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T18:16:16-04:00\n\nThe elections on Tuesday hardly seem to be top of mind for President Trump.\n\nHe has spent the last week crisscrossing Asia, talking trade, nuclear weapons and rare earths, and is headed to Florida this weekend. He has not appeared in person in any of the major states hosting elections, like New Jersey or California, to pump up his party’s candidate or cause. In Virginia, where a weak Republican candidate for governor is lagging behind an impervious-looking Democrat, he’s offered only a tepid endorsement late in the campaign.\n\n(This has not, of course, stopped Democrats from talking about him, either in California, where they are fighting to pass a ballot measure that could give them five more safe House seats, or anywhere else.)\n\nNone of this is unusual for a president in an off-year. But the contests — particularly the governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia — are essentially the opening salvos of the midterm elections. And even if Trump has relatively little to say about them, the results will offer signals about his political strength and his party’s strength more broadly, as it considers ways to keep his supporters in the fold when he is barred from once again topping the ticket.\n\n“Will those Trump voters become Republican voters?” asked Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who worked on Chris Christie’s successful off-year campaigns for New Jersey governor in 2009 and 2013. “Do they think any other race, other than presidential, is important enough to come out for?”\n\nHere are three story lines that show how even elections that aren’t directly about Trump can’t help but be a little Trumpy.\n\nWhen Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker and a Republican, first ran for governor of New Jersey in 2017, he cut a wonky profile and occasionally criticized Trump, who he knew repulsed swing voters.\n\nFast forward eight years — and a second unsuccessful run for governor in 2021 — and you have a candidate who has fundamentally shifted his approach, my colleague Nick Corasaniti wrote in a perceptive profile. Ciattarelli doesn’t talk so much about Trump. But he talks like him, decrying “open borders” and appearing with vaccine skeptics and far-right Trump-backers like Jack Posobiec. Nick wrote:\n\nSuch an approach amounts to a bet not yet tested in a competitive election since Mr. Trump’s return to power last year: that the margins in a close race can be made up by tacking closer to the Republican base in a general election, and that Trump supporters will turn out even without Mr. Trump atop the ticket.\n\nIt’s a departure from the timeworn tactic of playing to the middle, and if it works in a blue state, it will say a lot about the staying power of Trump’s political style.\n\nCiattarelli’s decision to tack so close to Trump reflects the president’s performance there in 2024, when he lost to former Vice President Kamala Harris by less than six percentage points, but showed remarkable strength in the state’s most diverse areas. Every single majority-Hispanic township in the state swung Trump’s way between 2020 and 2024, by 25 percentage points on average.\n\nThat, Shane Goldmacher and Christine Zhang wrote, makes Tuesday’s results in New Jersey an early test of whether that movement was “evidence of a durable political and racial realignment or a passing phenomenon specific to Mr. Trump.”\n\n“New Jersey ends up being the first meaningful temperature check since the last election,” said Carlos Odio, a Democratic pollster who specializes in studying Latino voting patterns and lives in New Jersey.\n\nCiattarelli appears to understand precisely what’s at stake, campaigning frequently in Black and Latino areas that were once considered safe Democratic turf.\n\nThere is no chance that a Republican is going to win New York City’s mayor’s race. But that hasn’t kept Trump entirely away from the contest to govern his hometown.\n\nHe mulled getting involved to stop Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, from winning. He spoke directly with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the Democrat and former Trump foil now running as an independent, about the race. His advisers discussed giving Mayor Eric Adams, the embattled Democratic incumbent, an administration job in exchange for dropping out (Adams eventually did drop out, sans job offer).\n\nNone of that has stopped the rise of Mamdani, a democratic socialist, but Trump has tried one more tactic: threatening the city with major cuts to federal funding if Mamdani is elected.\n\nTrump seems unlikely to change the outcome of the race. But the question for New York is how, if Mamdani is elected, the president might flex his power to shape the city itself.\n\nPOSTCARD FROM SACRAMENTO\n\nPolls suggest that California voters are likely to pass Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting measure on Tuesday, a win that could help Democrats flip five House seats next year — and that could pay political dividends for Newsom, too. My colleague Laurel Rosenhall, who covers California government, explains.\n\nThe ballot measure was framed as a way to fight President Trump’s mid-decade redistricting push with fire. But it could also serve as a foundation for a 2028 presidential campaign for Newsom himself.\n\nOver the course of the campaign, Newsom expanded a national list of supporters that helped him raise an astonishing $114 million in less than three months. The haul from small donations is especially notable, with $38 million from people across the country who responded to email and text message appeals.\n\nTheir contact information is on a list Newsom has been methodically building since his earliest days in politics. More than 25 years ago, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Newsom began collecting emails for a bond measure to fund San Francisco parks. Since then, he told me he’s been disciplined about expanding and maintaining the list that he calls “the most valuable asset” of his political career.\n\nNewsom leveraged that asset to turn a state level redistricting measure into an attention-grabbing national campaign. And that’s a platform he can draw on again in 2028, if he wants to.\n\nProponents for California’s new redistricting measure say voters are motivated by stopping Trump.\n\nThe Virginia legislature took the first step to redrawing Congressional maps to benefit Democrats in 2026.\n\nOhio is now the latest Republican-led state to redraw its congressional map to benefit the G.O.P.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\nThat’s what a spokesman for John Thune, the Senate majority leader, told my colleague Carl Hulse on Friday, shutting down a demand from President Trump to dispose of the filibuster in order to end the government shut down.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump took to Truth Social to call for Senate Republicans to “go for what is called the Nuclear Option.”\n\n“Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” he wrote.\n\nThune has weakened the filibuster, but he and other Senior Republicans fear that getting rid of it entirely would spectacularly backfire if Democrats regained control of the Senate.\n\nMore on Senate Republicans:\n\nSenators opposed the president’s plan to import Argentine beef and voted three times this week to end his power to enforce sweeping tariffs, indicating growing Republican angst over Trump’s trade agenda.\n\nIt was the end of President Trump’s five-day visit to three countries in Asia — a tour packed with extravagant welcome dinners, an aircraft rally and the gift of a replica gold crown — and The New York Times’s photographer Haiyun Jiang thought she was done for the day.\n\nShe had already photographed Trump and Xi Jinping of China shaking hands, and watched them recede into the bilateral meeting the whole trip had built up to. She and the other photographers had been told they wouldn’t see the two men together again.\n\nBut, about 90 minutes into Trump and Xi’s meeting, the media was told that the plan had changed, and the two men were coming out once more — together. That’s when Haiyun took this photo showing Trump whispering some final words to a smiling Xi, as the men in his delegation solemnly looked on.\n\nHaiyun keeps cameras on her all the time in the event of surprises like this. That happened earlier on the trip, too, when Air Force One flew from Tokyo to Busan, and the captain told the passengers that they would soon be able to see a spectacular view of Mt. Fuji.\n\nHaiyun, of course, had two cameras at hand, slung over the seat in front of her, poised to capture the unexpected.\n\nLaurel Rosenhall, Taylor Robinson and Ama Sarpomaa contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dd7yyly9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"21:56:03.985+00:00","title":"Tchéky Karyo, star of Nikita and The Missing, dies at 72","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"French actor Tchéky Karyo, born in Istanbul and raised in Paris, has died at the age of 72 due to cancer.

72\n\nFrench actor Tchéky Karyo, who had a starring role in the film Nikita and the TV series The Missing, has died aged 72.\n\nKaryo, who was born in Turkey but grew up in Paris, died of a cancer on Friday, AFP news agency reported.\n\nKnown largely for supporting roles, Karyo acted in films for nearly four decades, finding a second career in TV series in his final years.\n\nKaryo's wife, actress Valérie Keruzoré, and their children announced his death in a statement to the news agency.\n\nKaryo first made his mark in crime thriller La Balance (1982) and he played the handler Bob in Luc Besson's assassin film Nikita (1990).\n\nBBC audiences might best remember him for his role in The Missing (2014).\n\nThe first eight-part series, about the search for a missing boy in France, starred Karyo as French detective Julien Baptiste. James Nesbitt and Frances O'Connor played the boy's parents.\n\nThe second eight-part series, about a missing girl in Germany, was brodcast in 2016. Karyo returned as Baptiste, with David Morrissey and Keeley Hawes as the girl's parents.\n\nBoth series received positive reviews, with critics praising the cast, especially Karyo's performance.\n\nIn February 2019, a spin-off series titled Baptiste was broadcast on BBC One.\n\nLindsay Salt, Director of BBC Drama, said: \"We are so sad to learn of the passing of Tchéky Karyo. He was a truly brilliant and much loved actor and he will be fondly remembered by BBC viewers for his roles in The Missing, Baptiste and most recently Boat Story. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this time.\"\n\nKaryo was born on 4 October 1953 in Istanbul, the son of a Turkish lorry driver of Spanish-Jewish origin and a Greek mother, Le Monde newspaper writes.\n\nAfter several years as a theatrical actor, he saw his role in La Balance earn him a nomination for the César Award for Best Male Revelation.\n\nWith his strong jaw and penetrating stare, he went on to star in dozens of films of all kinds.\n\nOther French films included Besson's Joan of Arc (1993) and the anti-war epic A Very Long Engagement (2004). He was also cast in Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) and in the James Bond film GoldenEye (1995).\n\nOne of his starring roles was as the medieval prophet Nostradamus in the 1994 film of the same name, while his tiniest role was undoubtedly in Amélie (2001) where he only appeared as a face on an ID photograph in an album."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz91jyxj88ko","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:19:47.213+00:00","title":"How teenager gave street concert and was caught up in Russia's repressive past","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article follows the story of 18-year-old Diana Loginova and her music band Stoptime, who perform songs by politically critical Russian artists like Noize MC and Monetochka in St Petersburg.

the edge of St Petersburg they're reading out a list of names.\n\nEach name is a victim of the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's Great Terror.\n\nIn this part of Russia there are thousands of names to be read. Thousands of lives to remember on Russia's annual Remembrance Day for Victims of Political Repression.\n\nBuried in the Levashovo Wasteland are believed to be at least 20,000 people - possibly as many as 45,000 - who were denounced, shot and disposed of in mass graves; individuals, as well as whole families destroyed in the dictator's purge in the 1930s.\n\nNailed to the trunks of pine trees are portraits of the executed. Standing here you can feel the ghosts of Russia's past.\n\nBut what of the present?\n\nToday, Russian authorities speak less about Stalin's crimes against his own people, preferring to portray the dictator as a victorious wartime leader.\n\nWhat's more, in recent years a string of repressive laws has been adopted here to punish dissent and silence criticism of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nKremlin critics might not be denounced as \"enemies of the people\" like under Stalin. But increasingly they are being designated \"foreign agents\".\n\nThe authorities claim the labelling helps to protect Russia from external threats.\n\nMore than three and a half years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities have two main objectives: victory abroad and conformity at home.\n\nAnyone here who publicly challenges, questions or even hints they doubt the official narrative that, in this war Russia is in the right, risks becoming a target.\n\nAt Leninsky District Courthouse, the stairwell outside Courtroom 11 is packed with journalists. There is barely room to move.\n\nI get talking to Irina. Her daughter Diana is on her way here in a police car for a court appearance.\n\n\"This must be frightening for you,\" I say.\n\nIrina nods.\n\n\"I never thought anything like this could happen,\" says Irina softly. \"You can't imagine it. Until it happens to you.\"\n\nMinutes later, 18-year-old Diana Loginova arrives in the building guarded by three police officers. She hugs her mother and is taken into court.\n\nDiana has already spent 13 days in jail for \"organising a mass public gathering of citizens resulting in a violation of public order\".\n\nBut the charges keep coming.\n\nThe \"mass gathering\" was an improvised street concert which the authorities claim obstructed pedestrian access to a Metro station.\n\nDiana Loginova is a music student and, under the name Naoko, lead singer with the band Stoptime.\n\nOn the streets of St Petersburg, Stoptime have been performing songs by exiled Russian artists like Noize MC and Monetochka, singer-songwriters fiercely critical of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nMany of these prominent musicians, now abroad, have been officially designated foreign agents by Russian authorities.\n\nVideos posted online show that Stoptime's street concerts have been attracting quite a crowd, with dozens of mainly young people singing along and dancing to the music.\n\nWhilst it is not forbidden in Russia to sing or play songs by foreign agents, in May a Russian court banned Noize MC's track Swan Lake Cooperative, claiming it contained \"propaganda for the violent change of the constitutional order\".\n\nSwan Lake is seen by many as a symbol of political change in Russia.\n\nIn the USSR, Soviet TV often showed the ballet following the death of Soviet leaders, and it was back on Soviet TV screens in 1991 during the failed coup by communist hardliners. Lake (Ozero in Russian) is also the name of a dacha co-operative widely associated with President Putin's inner circle.\n\nA video clip of Stoptime performing the song went viral recently on social media.\n\nDiana Loginova was detained on 15 October. Police also arrested her boyfriend, guitarist Alexander Orlov, and drummer, Vladislav Leontyev.\n\nThe three band members were sentenced to between 12 and 13 days behind bars.\n\nIn Courtroom 11 Diana is facing an additional charge: discrediting the Russian armed forces. It relates to one of the songs she sang: You're a Soldier by (\"foreign agent\") Monetochka.\n\n\" You're a soldier, \" begins the chorus.\n\n\"And whatever war you are fighting,\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'll be on the other side.\"\n\nAfter a brief hearing the judge finds Diana guilty of discrediting Russia's army and fines her 30,000 roubles (£285).\n\nBut she is not free to go. The police take Diana back to the police station and prepare more charges.\n\nThe next day she and her boyfriend Alexander are brought to Smolninsky District Court. I manage to have a word with them before they enter the courtroom.\n\n\"I'm very pleased, and it's important, that people have been supporting us, that many people are on our side, on the side of truth,\" Diana tells me.\n\n\"I'm surprised by how things have been exaggerated. We've been accused of lots of things we didn't do. All we were doing was bringing the music we like to a mass audience. The power of music is very important. What's happening now proves that.\"\n\n\"I think it's not the words, it's the music that is most important,\" guitarist Alexander Orlov tells me. \"Music says everything for people. It always has.\"\n\nAlexander reveals he proposed to Diana when the police van they were being transported in stopped at a petrol station.\n\n\"I made a ring out of a tissue,\" he tells me. \"I had time to get on my knees, and she said yes.\"\n\n\"We hope we'll be back home soon,\" says Diana. \"That's what we're dreaming of most.\"\n\nThey won't be going home yet. At this latest court hearing the judge sends Diana and Alexander back to jail for another 13 days for more public order offences.\n\nCivil society in Russia is under intense pressure. Yet supporters of Diana Loginova and Stoptime are trying to make their voices heard.\n\n\"I was on the street when Diana was singing and people were singing along so beautifully,\" says Alla outside the courthouse. \"For me it was important to be here to support Diana and show her some people do care. This should not be happening.\"\n\nTo another of Diana's supporters I suggest that, in Russia now, displaying solidarity for anyone accused of discrediting the Russian army requires a degree of courage.\n\n\"It's people like Diana who are the brave ones,\" says Sasha. \"We're cowards. Some people are heroes. Others just follow behind.\"\n\n\"Some people [in Russia] are scared,\" continues Sasha. \"But others here do support the authorities and what's going on. Unfortunately, I know people like this. It came as a blow when I discovered that people I've been friends with for 40 years support what's happening. For years they've been watching Russian TV. I haven't.\"\n\nIn the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Mikhailov expressed his solidarity through music. The street musician performed songs in support of Diana Loginova. He was detained and jailed for 14 days for \"petty hooliganism\".\n\nDespite the crackdown, young street musicians in St Petersburg continue to perform music by artists labelled foreign agents by Russian authorities.\n\nIt's a chilly autumn evening. But passers-by have stopped to listen to a teenage band outside a St Petersburg Metro station. Among the songs they're performing are compositions by \"foreign agents\" Noize MC and Morgenshtern.\n\nSuddenly the police turn up. The concert is over.\n\nI look on as three band members are taken away in a police car.\n\nI go to meet someone else in St Petersburg accused of \"discreditation\".\n\nLudmila Vasilyeva, 84, was born two months before Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nShe survived the Nazi siege of Leningrad (then the name for St Petersburg) and has carried with her all her life how devastating war can be.\n\nSo, when Vladimir Putin ordered a mass invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ludmila was deeply shocked.\n\nEarlier this year, on the third anniversary of Russia's \"special military operation\", Ludmila went on to the street to express her anti-war stance.\n\n\"I wrote on my placard: 'People! Let's stop the war. We bear responsibility for peace on Planet Earth!'\"\n\nFollowing her personal protest Ludmila received a letter from the police instructing her to report to the police station.\n\n\"They told me that I had discredited our soldiers. How? By calling for peace? I let them know that everything I'd wanted to say I'd already made quite clear on my placard and that I wouldn't be going down to the station. They threatened to take me to court. And in the end that's what they did.\"\n\nLudmila was fined 10,000 roubles (£95) for \"discrediting the Russian armed forces\".\n\nShe has no regrets and seemingly, despite the growing repression around her, no fear.\n\n\"Why should I be scared?\" Ludmila asks me. \"Of what and of whom should I be frightened? I'm not scared of anyone. I speak the truth. And they know that.\"\n\nShe believes that increasing authoritarianism stems from those in power fearing the public.\n\n\"People are scared. But [the authorities] are more scared. That's why they're tightening the screws.\"\n\nLudmila Vasilyeva's outspokenness is an exception, not the rule. Today few Russians engage in public protest. I ask Ludmila why that is: is it fear, indifference, or because of support for the authorities?\n\n\"Most people are focused on their own lives, on just surviving,\" Ludmila replies.\n\nBut she claims that when she speaks her mind publicly many people agree with her.\n\n\"When I go to the shops, I always strike up a conversation. No one has ever sneaked on me or put in a complaint about me.\n\n\"Once I was saying something down at the post office. Someone turned to me and said: 'Quiet, keep it down.' I replied: 'Why should I be quiet? What I'm saying, isn't it the truth? Truth must be spoken loudly.'\"\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n\"When I was standing with my placard and talking to a policeman, a man in his 50s came up to us. He leant forward and said: 'Just strangle her.'\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/technology/ai-spending-accelerating.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:02:30-04:00","title":"Big Tech’s A.I.

Spending Is Accelerating (Again)\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T05:02:30-04:00\n\nFour of the tech industry’s wealthiest companies made it clear this week that their spending on artificial intelligence was not about to slow down.\n\nBut the outlays from Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon — which all raised their spending by billions of dollars, saying they needed to meet demand for A.I. — are increasingly feeding concerns that the tech industry is heading toward a dangerous bubble.\n\nArtificial intelligence remains an unproven and expensive technology that could take years to fully develop. How much companies will ultimately get back in return from A.I. products like chatbots is unclear. And smaller companies pursuing A.I. gold, financial analysts pointed out, are not nearly as wealthy.\n\nLast week, the Bank of England wrote that while the building of data centers, which provide computing power for A.I., had so far largely come from the cash produced by the biggest companies, it would increasingly involve more debt. If A.I. underwhelms — or the systems ultimately require far less computing — there could be growing risk.\n\n“This is a fast-evolving topic, and the future is highly uncertain,” the bank wrote.\n\nConcerns mushroomed this week after a series of earnings reports. On Wednesday, Google said it was increasing what it planned to spend on A.I. data center projects this year by $6 billion, after dropping nearly $64 billion on them over the past nine months.\n\nMicrosoft said it had spent $35 billion in its latest quarter, $5 billion more than what it had told investors to expect just a few months ago. And Meta raised its spending forecast to at least $70 billion by the end of the year, which would be nearly double what it spent last year.\n\nOn Thursday, Amazon also said it would be “very aggressive” in adding more data centers and would spend $125 billion this year on capital expenditures — and even more next year.\n\nGoogle, Microsoft and Amazon, which are the three largest providers of cloud computing in the United States, said they did not have enough computing power to meet customer demand. That’s despite shelling out a combined $112 billion in just the last three months on capital expenditures, which included construction of data centers. Over the last 12 months, those three and Meta totaled more than $360 billion in capital expenditures.\n\n“I thought we were going to catch up,” Amy Hood, Microsoft’s finance chief, said in a call with investors on Wednesday. “We are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one place. It is increasing across many places.”\n\nThat same day, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, addressed concerns that the A.I. build-out was unsustainable. He said he did not believe the A.I. investments resembled the late-1990s dot-com boom. Back then, he said, there “was a clear bubble” when the businesses driving the market “were ideas rather than companies.”\n\nNow, Mr. Powell said, the largest companies behind the transformation are highly valued and largely funding their expansions from their own businesses, rather than loose lending.\n\n“I won’t go into particular names, but they have earnings, and it looks like they have business models and profit and that kind of thing, so it is really a different thing,” he said.\n\nMr. Powell did not comment on concerns that, unlike the biggest tech companies, smaller companies — often the customers and partners of those cloud computing giants — were also spending fast on A.I. projects without the safety net of enormously lucrative online advertising or software businesses.\n\nBut for the moneyed foursome that announced earnings this week, spending hundreds of billions of dollars on new data centers is not a worry — not when they churned out a combined $109 billion in operating profit, which excludes taxes and investments, in just the last quarter.\n\nMs. Hood said Microsoft had $400 billion in future sales under contract. “That’s for booked business,” she said. “Today.” The number did not include the $250 billion in computing power that OpenAI, the creator of the ChatGPT chatbot, committed to buy from Microsoft in an announcement this week.\n\n(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)\n\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, raised estimates for how much it planned to spend this year to at least $91 billion from $85 billion. The company is processing at least 20 times as much data through its various A.I. products as it did a year ago, the chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said.\n\nAmazon has doubled its cloud infrastructure capacity since 2022 and expects to double it again by 2027 to meet demand, its chief executive, Andy Jassy, told investors on Thursday. “As fast as we’re adding capacity right now,” he said, “we’re monetizing it.”\n\nMeta, which owns Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, also raised its spending estimate for the year, from at least $66 billion to at least $70 billion. But it made a different case for the expenditures.\n\nUnlike the large cloud providers, which have other customers that can use their data centers, Meta makes money from A.I. only when it uses the systems itself — in its core products to make digital ads more effective or its social networking products more engaging. It is also investing heavily to develop what it calls “superintelligence,” a theoretical technology where A.I. systems become smarter than humans.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, said he would rather build more and not less to be ready should superintelligence arrive quickly. “That way, if superintelligence arrives sooner, we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift in many large opportunities,” he said.\n\nIf it takes longer, Mr. Zuckerberg said, Meta could use the infrastructure for its core business. “In the worst case,” he added, “we will just slow building new infrastructure for some period while we grow into what we build.”\n\nInvestors were less sure. Meta’s stock fell 11 percent on Thursday.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/business/elon-musk-aaron-greenspan-tech.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:00:14-04:00","title":"What If You Spent Every Waking Moment Taking On Elon Musk?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Aaron Greenspan, a 30-something tech entrepreneur, chose to invest his wealth in betting against the tech industry rather than pursuing startup ventures or traditional consumer purchases.

He wasn’t moved by the prospect of homeownership; he didn’t even buy a car. His only splurge was an order of five long-sleeved T-shirts, on sale. As for the rest of his nest egg? He decided to use it to bet against the tech industry, which he saw as a bubble on the verge of bursting.\n\nOver the next several years, he placed financial bets against Facebook, which he believed was rife with fake accounts; and Nvidia, because he was deeply skeptical of crypto companies, some of Nvidia’s key customers at the time. He built up a significant position in an index fund that allowed him to short the Nasdaq because he believed that tech stocks had galloped ahead of any price that their future earnings could justify.\n\nSome of his deepest convictions were about Tesla, which he came to see as an elaborate exercise in market manipulation. In August 2018, Elon Musk, the company’s chief executive, posted on social media that he had secured funding to take the electric-vehicle maker private at $420 a share — far above where it was trading — and the stock appreciated soon after. But the Securities and Exchange Commission said the post misled investors and accused Musk of securities fraud the next month. Musk and Tesla agreed to a $40 million settlement soon after.\n\n“Because he was in the cross hairs of the government, I was like, ‘How solid is this business really?’” Greenspan recalled.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Is Making Death Threats Way More Realistic\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T12:45:06-04:00\n\nEven though she was toughened by years spent working in internet activism, Caitlin Roper found herself traumatized by the online threats she received this year.\n\nThere was the picture of herself hanging from a noose, dead. And another of herself ablaze, screaming.\n\nThe posts were part of a surge of vitriol directed at Ms. Roper and her colleagues at Collective Shout, an Australian activist group, on X and other social media platforms. Some of it, including images of the women flayed, decapitated or fed into a wood chipper, was seemingly enabled — and given a visceral realism — by generative artificial intelligence. In some of the videos, Ms. Roper was wearing a blue floral dress that she does, in fact, own.\n\n“It’s these weird little details that make it feel more real and, somehow, a different kind of violation,” she said. “These things can go from fantasy to more than fantasy.”\n\nArtificial intelligence is already raising concerns for its ability to mimic real voices in service of scams or to produce deepfake pornography without a subject’s permission. Now, the technology is also being used for violent threats — priming them to maximize fear by making them far more personalized, more convincing and more easily delivered.\n\n“Two things will always happen when technology like this gets developed: We will find clever and creative and exciting ways to use it, and we will find horrific and awful ways to abuse it,” said Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. “What’s frustrating is that this is not a surprise.”\n\nDigitally generated threats have been possible for at least a few years. A judge in Florida was sent a video in 2023, most likely made using a character customization tool in the Grand Theft Auto 5 video game, that featured an avatar who looked and walked like her being hacked and shot to death.\n\nBut threatening images are rapidly becoming easier to make, and more persuasive. One YouTube page had more than 40 realistic videos — most likely made using A.I., according to experts who reviewed the channel — each showing a woman being shot. (YouTube, after The New York Times contacted it, said it had terminated the channel for “multiple violations” of its guidelines.) A deepfake video of a student carrying a gun sent a high school into lockdown this spring. In July, a lawyer in Minneapolis said xAI’s Grok chatbot had provided an anonymous social media user with detailed instructions on breaking into his house, sexually assaulting him and disposing of his body.\n\nUntil recently, artificial intelligence could replicate real people only if they had a huge online presence, such as film stars with throngs of publicly accessible photos. Now, a single profile image will suffice, said Dr. Farid, who co-founded GetReal Security, a service that identifies malicious digital content. (Ms. Roper said she had worn the blue floral dress in a photo published a few years ago in an Australian newspaper.)\n\nThe same is true of voices — what once took hours of example data to clone now requires less than a minute.\n\n“The concern is that now, almost anyone with no skills but with motive or lack of scruples can easily use these tools to do damage,” said Jane Bambauer, a professor who teaches about A.I. and the law at the University of Florida.\n\nWorries about A.I.-assisted threats and extortion intensified with the introduction this month of Sora, a text-to-video app from OpenAI. The app, which allows users to upload images of themselves to be incorporated into hyper-realistic scenes, quickly depicted actual people in frightening situations.\n\nThe Times tested Sora and produced videos that appeared to show a gunman in a bloody classroom and a hooded man stalking a young girl. Grok also readily added a bloody gunshot wound to a photo of a real person.\n\n“From the perspective of identity, everyone’s vulnerable,” Dr. Farid said.\n\nAn OpenAI spokeswoman said the company relied on multiple defenses, including guardrails to block unsafe content from being created, experiments to uncover previously unknown weaknesses and automated content moderation systems. (The Times sued OpenAI in 2023, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems, an assertion that OpenAI has denied.)\n\nExperts in A.I. safety, however, said companies had not done nearly enough. Alice Marwick, director of research at Data & Society, a nonprofit organization, described most guardrails as “more like a lazy traffic cop than a firm barrier — you can get a model to ignore them and work around them.”\n\nMs. Roper said the torrent of online abuse starting this summer — including hundreds of harassing posts sent specifically to her — was linked to her work on a campaign to shut down violent video games glorifying rape, incest and sexual torture. On X, where most of the abuse appeared, she said, some harassing images and accounts were taken down. But the company also told her repeatedly that other posts depicting her violent death did not violate the platform’s terms of service. In fact, X once included one of her harassers on a list of recommended accounts for her to follow.\n\nSome of the harassers also claimed to have used Grok not just to create the images but to research how to find the women at home and at local cafes.\n\nFed up, Ms. Roper decided to post some examples. Soon after, according to screenshots, X told her that she was in breach of its safety policies against gratuitous gore and temporarily locked her account.\n\nNeither X nor xAI, the company that owns Grok, responded to requests for comment.\n\nA.I. is also making other kinds of threats more convincing. For example: swatting, the practice of placing false emergency calls with the aim of inciting a large response from the police and emergency personnel. A.I. “has significantly intensified the scale, precision and anonymity” of such attacks, the National Association of Attorneys General said this summer. On a lesser scale, a spate of A.I.-generated videos showing supposed home invasions have caused the targeted residents to call police departments around the country.\n\nNow, perpetrators of swatting can compile convincing false reports by cloning voices and manipulating images. One serial swatter used simulated gunfire to suggest that a shooter was in the parking lot of a Washington State high school. The campus was locked down for 20 minutes; police officers and federal agents showed up.\n\nA.I. was already complicating schools’ efforts to protect students, raising concerns about personalized sexual images or rumors spread via fake videos, said Brian Asmus, a former police chief who was working as the senior manager of safety and security for the school district when the swatter called. Now, the technology is adding an extra security challenge, making false alarms harder to distinguish from true emergency calls.\n\n“How does law enforcement respond to something that’s not real?” Mr. Asmus asked. “I don’t think we’ve really gotten ahead of it yet.”\n\nStuart A. Thompson contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/business/interest-rates-money-markets-stocks-bonds.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:58:45-04:00","title":"Interest Rates Are Falling.

Why Are People Still Buying Money Market Funds?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T10:58:45-04:00\n\nMoney market funds seem to be defying gravity. They are paying less in interest to investors, but becoming more popular.\n\nGiven a choice, people usually want more for their money, not less. Yet since the Federal Reserve began pushing short-term interest rates down more than a year ago, investors have been funneling hundreds of billions of additional dollars into these funds.\n\nThat may seem strange but there are good reasons for it. Thanks to a combination of convenience, good returns, and favorable comparisons with alternatives, money market funds are likely to continue attracting enormous wads of cash, even though the Fed announced on Wednesday that it was lowering short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nBig money market funds have been paying more than 4 percent annualized interest, according to Crane Data, an independent financial market research firm. Within the next several weeks, these funds are almost certain to offer about a quarter of a percentage point less. But Peter G. Crane, a founder of Crane Data, is quite confident that their appeal will be undiminished.\n\n“I expect about $100 billion to pour into money market funds each month for the rest of the year,” he said in an interview. “The funds will probably reach $8 trillion in assets by the end of this calender year,” up from around $7.8 trillion now, he said. “That’s very likely to happen, even though rates are going lower.”\n\nWhy the continuing popularity?\n\nBasically, it’s because money market funds are still a good deal, even if they are no longer paying more than 5 percent interest, as many of the biggest funds did through much of last year.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

after he said that he hoped that his wife, Usha Vance, who is of Indian heritage and was raised in a Hindu family, would eventually convert to his own Catholic faith.\n\n“Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by in church?” he said during an event at the University of Mississippi on Wednesday, in response to a question from the audience. “Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way.”\n\nThe comments, which were made in front of thousands of students as part of a Turning Point USA event honoring the slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk, were widely reported by news media outlets and quickly criticized on social media.\n\nBeyond partisan salvos, there was also criticism from some Indians and Indian Americans across the political spectrum who said that Mr. Vance was not respecting his wife’s religious decisions. Some also said his remarks suggested that Hinduism was inferior at a time when aggressive immigration enforcement has left many South Asian Americans and people of non-Christian faiths feeling uncertain and afraid of their place in American society.\n\nThe backlash reflected worries by some in the South Asian community over the Trump administration’s immigration policies and its embrace of conservative Christian groups.\n\nSuhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, described Mr. Vance’s remarks as “basically saying that my wife, this aspect of her is just not enough.”\n\n“If you were any ordinary pastor, then whatever,” said Ms. Shukla, who has been critical of both Democrats and Republicans in the past. “But he’s not the pastor in chief, he’s the vice president wanting to be president.”\n\n“There’s a lot of uncertainty in the community,” Ms. Shukla said. “This just added kind of fuel to those fears.”\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Vance responded to the upswell of criticism. In a reply to a commenter on X who accused him of throwing his wife’s religion “under the bus,” Mr. Vance called the message “disgusting” and full of “anti-Christian bigotry.”\n\nHe also called Mrs. Vance the “most amazing blessing” in his life, noting that he had also said that at the Turning Point event. He said that she had encouraged him to re-engage with his faith and that while he still wished that she would convert, he would “continue to love and support her” regardless.\n\nIt is not unusual for people in interfaith relationships, and especially for Christians across denominations, to hope for their partners to convert. And the Roman Catholic Church teaches that baptism is required for salvation.\n\nRaised in a loosely evangelical family, Mr. Vance has described himself as going through an “angry, atheist phase” before later converting to Catholicism. Mr. Vance’s embrace of the Catholic faith is evident in his politics, as seen through his frequent emphasis on traditional family principles, social conservatism and economic populism.\n\nMrs. Vance, who was born and raised in Southern California by parents who immigrated from India, has spoken about growing up in a religious Hindu household. The couple, who first met when they were studying at Yale Law School, have spoken publicly before about her role in Mr. Vance’s conversion and their approach to raising their three children in an intercultural and interfaith household.\n\nIn a June interview on Meghan McCain’s podcast, Mrs. Vance said that while the children went to Catholic school, they could choose whether they wanted to be baptized.\n\n“The kids know that I’m not Catholic, and they have plenty of access to the Hindu tradition from books that we give them, to things that we show them, to the visit recently to India and some of the religious elements of that visit,” she said. “So it is a part of their lives and they know many practicing Hindus as a part of their lives in their own family.”\n\nThese family issues, though, can take on a different valence when placed within a broader political and historical context.\n\nThere is a sensitivity in India to proselytizing by non-Hindus because of the long history of Muslim rule and Christian missionary work.\n\nMr. Vance’s comments also appeared to have struck a nerve at a time when rhetoric against immigrants has been growing. An August report from Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that tracks acts of violence against Asian Americans, documented recent spikes in online hate rhetoric against South Asians related mainly to the mayoral run of Zohran Mamdani and the ongoing debate around H-1B visas.\n\nEarlier this month, a City Council member in Palm Bay, Fla., was censured over a series of social media messages in which he disparaged Indians as coming to the United States to “drain our pockets” and called for them to be deported en masse. The member, Chandler Langevin, is now suing the city of Palm Bay saying that the censure restrictions violated his First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nSangay Mishra, an associate professor at Drew University and the author of “Desis Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans,” said that Mr. Vance’s comments may have come from a deeply personal place, but they were interpreted by some as effectively “nodding to these larger politics of anti-immigration, anti-migrants, anti-replacement theory and white Christian nationalism.”\n\nNot all Indian Americans were bothered by Mr. Vance’s comments.\n\nRami Reddy Mutyala is chairman of Shri Mandir, a Hindu temple in San Diego that Mrs. Vance’s parents occasionally attend. Even though he is a Republican, he said that he disapproved of President Trump, who he said was acting like a “monarch.”\n\nBut he saw nothing wrong with the vice president’s remarks.\n\n“They are adults, they can decide whatever is good for them,” he said. “We cannot force anybody — even I cannot force my children to convert to Hinduism.”\n\nElizabeth Dias contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/world/europe/prince-andrew-explainer.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:02:48-04:00","title":"What’s Next for Andrew After He Loses His Royal Titles?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to sustained public and political pressure, King Charles III has stripped Prince Andrew of his royal titles and evicted him from his official residence.

shutdown to fund the things he considers important. He has found ways to pay military service members and F.B.I. agents. He has distributed tariff revenues to women with small children and arranged billions of dollars in financial support for Argentina. He has even ordered the Interior Department to keep federal lands open for hunting.\n\nAnd what has Mr. Trump refused to fund?\n\nAs the shutdown enters its second month, the president still will not agree to an extension of the federal tax credits that allow millions of Americans to afford health insurance. Last week the Trump administration also said it would stop distributing food stamps to more than 40 million lower-income families, declining to tap the program’s emergency reserve fund.\n\nA federal judge in Rhode Island intervened on Friday, ordering the administration to use the program’s reserves. A second federal judge, in Massachusetts, indicated that she was also prepared to rule against the administration if it did not agree to continue distributing food stamps. We urge the administration to abide by the decision and allow millions of Americans to receive food aid.\n\nThe government has never paused the distribution of food stamps, even during past shutdowns, and the threat is just one of the ways this shutdown is causing pain. More than a million federal workers are not being paid. The Small Business Administration is not making loans. Regulators are not conducting many routine safety inspections of food processing plants.\n\nMr. Trump and his congressional allies could end all of this by doing what they should have done months ago: making a deal. Under current Senate rules, Republicans manifestly do not have enough votes to pass a funding bill on their own, and it is absurd that they continue to insist that Democrats should simply acquiesce. The hard work of governing in a democracy is hammering out a compromise.\n\nMr. Trump already has sought to pile pressure on Democrats by suspending funding for projects in blue states, including the important Hudson River train tunnel between New Jersey and New York and mass transit in Chicago. The attempt to raise the stakes by suspending the distribution of food stamps is unconscionable. The administration would literally be keeping food from the mouths of hungry children. Food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provide a monthly credit to millions of households that do not make enough money to feed themselves. Many recipients work low-wage jobs. Others are disabled or elderly.\n\nThe Agriculture Department, which administers the program, has an emergency reserve of $5.5 billion that could have been used to maintain benefits. During the last long shutdown, in Mr. Trump’s first term, the department said it would tap that fund to delay any interruption in the distribution of benefits. As recently as Sept. 30, the day before the current shutdown began, the department said that remained its plan. Instead, however, the Trump administration insisted the reserve was “not legally available” because it was meant for the aftermath of natural disasters.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, have remained united in their insistence that Republicans must agree to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits as part of any funding bill. They have resisted despite the pain Mr. Trump is causing because the credits are worth fighting for. The cost of health insurance plans sold through the A.C.A. marketplaces is set to rise sharply next year. The expiring tax credits would have shielded buyers from most of the increase. Without the credits, the average amount that people must pay each month is expected to rise to $159 from $74, according to KFF, a health research group.\n\nFor many, the difference — about $1,000 a year on average — would make the plans unaffordable. Indeed, one reason the premiums are rising is that insurers anticipate the cost increases will cause a significant number of relatively healthy people to drop their insurance, raising costs for everyone else.\n\nRepublicans say their party has become the party of the American working class. But many working families rely on the tax credits to afford health insurance. And many of those same families rely on food stamps to put enough food on the table. Mr. Trump can serve their needs by demonstrating his skills as a negotiator. It’s time to make a deal.\n\nSource photographs by juefraphoto, Oksana Dolgikh and Muhammad Labib Adilah, via Getty Images.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Now, the Trump administration is seeking to thwart similar state efforts, potentially eroding protections for Americans who struggle to pay health care bills.\n\nFifteen states have passed laws in recent years restricting the inclusion of medical debt on credit reports in some way. The reports, and the three-digit credit scores that summarize them, act as financial gatekeepers that determine if people can qualify for loans and what interest rate they’ll pay. A blemished credit history can also make it hard to rent an apartment or get a job.\n\nAbout 14 million people, or 6 percent of adults, owed more than $1,000 in medical debt in 2021, according to an analysis by KFF, a health research group.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published guidance saying Biden-era guidance was “wrong” in concluding that states can regulate the use of information like medical debt in credit reports.\n\nFederal credit reporting law, the new guidance said, overrides state laws that “touch on broad areas of credit reporting.” The notice in the Federal Register was signed by Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, who is also serving as the bureau’s acting head.\n\nThe Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents credit bureaus, applauded the consumer bureau’s action, saying there should be “one national standard” to govern how information is provided to the credit bureaus.\n\nThe consumer bureau’s guidance, formally known as an interpretive rule, “does not have the force or effect of law,” the bureau noted.\n\nBut the new guidance may well invite court challenges to the state laws, said Ted Mermin, executive director of the Center for Consumer Law & Economic Justice at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law.\n\nBenjamin Corb, a spokesman for the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in an email that “the industry is keeping all options open at this time.”\n\nAs Mr. Vought and the Trump administration have worked to defang the watchdog consumer bureau, consumer advocates have looked to states as a backstop for consumer protections.\n\nAllison Sesso, president of Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that buys bulk medical debt at a discount and pays it off for borrowers, said the new guidance was disappointing. But she cautioned that nothing had changed yet and that states “should and will” fight any challenges to their laws. In a recent survey that her group conducted with NORC, a nonpartisan research group at the University of Chicago, three-fourths of voters said they wanted their state to pass laws that would protect people from medical debt.\n\nAs many Americans prepare to choose health coverage for 2026 during the annual open enrollment period, they are confronting steeper costs in both employer plans and those sold on Affordable Care Act marketplaces, where many face double-digit premium increases. Cuts to Medicaid, the health program for the poor, are also likely to make care costlier for many Americans next year.\n\n“A lot more people are going to incur medical debt,” said Julie Margetta Morgan, a former consumer bureau official who is president of the Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nThe three big credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion — voluntarily removed medical debts under $500 from credit reports in 2023, and that policy remains in place, a spokesman for the industry association said. The consumer bureau said in 2024 that the policy had reduced the share of Americans with unpaid medical bills in their credit files, but that further reforms were still needed.\n\nThe industry argues that regardless of how people acquire medical debt, lenders need to know if borrowers owe significant amounts of money in order to make sound decisions about whether to extend credit.\n\nTypically, doctors and hospitals don’t directly report unpaid bills to credit bureaus but may send them to collection agencies, which report delinquencies. In some cases, providers may sue patients directly.\n\nIn 2022, the consumer bureau under the Biden administration issued guidance saying the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act allowed states to ban medical debt from credit reports. The bureau said its research showed that medical bills weren’t as “predictive” of repayment risk as other types of debt because medical debt was often unplanned and medical billing was complex. The role of insurance can slow things down, and there may be disagreements about whether a bill is really owed.\n\nIn 2024, the Biden administration proposed a formal rule to eliminate medical debt from credit reports and deemed it final in January, just before President Trump took office. But before the rule took effect, two industry groups sued to stop it, arguing that the bureau had overstepped its authority. The Trump administration supported the plaintiffs, and in July a federal judge voided the rule, while also questioning similar state laws.\n\nIf consumers get a medical bill they can’t afford, they should try to negotiate a reduction with their provider, Ms. Sesso at Undue Medical Debt said. Make sure the doctor or hospital has a full picture of your financial situation, she said, and make it clear if you are strapped in other ways, not just struggling to pay a single bill.\n\nMs. Sesso also suggested that consumers ask if a hospital offers financial assistance, including charity care. Medical providers are aware that even people with insurance may have high deductibles and can struggle with medical bills, she said.\n\n“People do slip through the cracks,” she said. “Look into it, and apply for it.”\n\nIf you don’t qualify for financial help, request a payment plan. But be sure you can afford the payments before agreeing to the plan, Ms. Sesso said. If the amount is too high, you may fall behind and end up defaulting anyway.\n\nIf you’re not comfortable negotiating on your own, seek help from a friend.\n\nDo not put medical bills on a credit card, Ms. Sesso said. You may pay high interest rates on the debt, and because it’s no longer distinguishable as medical debt, it can be more difficult to negotiate payment plans.\n\nYolanda Pierson, 49, of Blaine, Minn., said she had learned from hard experience to ask about financial help if the cost of medical treatment seemed overwhelming.\n\nMs. Pierson said her son had a rare eye disease that required multiple surgical procedures over several years. Even though she had insurance, she amassed thousands of dollars in medical debt on credit cards and was eventually sued for payment in court. Only later, she said, did she learn that she would have qualified for financial assistance.\n\n“They never offered financial support,” she said. “I never asked, ‘Is there help?’”\n\nMs. Pierson said her experience had led her to testify in support of a Minnesota law that took effect in 2023 and requires hospitals to screen patients for possible qualification for financial help or discounted services and to help them apply before sending any debt to collections.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/opinion/day-of-the-dead-mexico.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:05-04:00","title":"For Day of the Dead, a Burst of Flowers to Honor the Departed","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the Day of the Dead, people in Mexico City use the cempasúchil (marigold) flower to honor loved ones who died of Covid, especially in the absence of traditional funerals due to pandemic restrictions.

In Mexico City, people who lost a loved one to Covid use the flower to honor their dead.\n\nSupported by\n\nBy César Martínez Barba\n\nMr. Martínez Barba is a documentary filmmaker.\n\nThe life of the marigold, known as the cempasúchil in Mexico, reflects our own: the plant sprouts, grows, flowers and dies. The flowers’ yellow and orange glow is ubiquitous across Mexico every year in the first few days of November, during Day of the Dead, as families place cempasúchil flowers on altars and at cemeteries to create a path to guide their loved ones back home.\n\nMy grandmother died of Covid in October 2020, just as the cempasúchil began to appear in the markets of Mexico City. Her death was sudden, and it was a painful experience for my family. Because of the restrictions on gatherings during Covid in Mexico, a funeral was not held after her death.\n\nA few days later, my cousin Gabriel, who lived with my grandmother, went to buy the materials for her first altar. When I saw the image of the altar through family text messages, I was struck by the beauty of his gift to her memory. He created it alone in their shared apartment; this was the only ceremony he could assemble to celebrate her life.\n\nAround her portrait beamed the sunlike glow of the cempasúchil. Absorbed by its radiance, I wondered what other hands had passed over the flowers resting on her altar. Had they faced a similar loss? Did they have the chance to celebrate their loved ones?\n\nThese questions led me to retrace the path that those flowers traveled: from the fields where they were harvested to the markets where they were sold and then to my grandmother’s altar. Along the way, I met people who had lost their loved ones to Covid and gained a deeper understanding of the unique grief we experienced during the pandemic. In the short documentary above, “más y más y más flores,” I observe how the cempasúchil not only connects us to those in the realm beyond, but to one another in the world of the living.\n\nAfter the Day of the Dead has passed, when the flowers wither and fall, seeds appear and scatter. From its own death, the cempasúchil’s next cycle of life begins.\n\nCésar Martínez Barba is a filmmaker living in New York City.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

A lifelong Democrat who now identifies as an independent, she joked that “they were going to take away my Black card” after she endorsed Mr. Ciattarelli.\n\n“A Newark girl voting for a Republican?” she said with a laugh.\n\nHector Lora, the mayor of Passaic who is supporting Ms. Sherrill, also tipped his hat to Mr. Ciattarelli for his frequent visits to his city of 70,000, where nearly half of the residents were born outside the United States.\n\n“He is everywhere,” Mr. Lora said. “He has spoken to Latino pastors, he’s going to the barbershops. If you welcome him to speak, he will show up.”\n\nMr. Ciattarelli is aiming to repeat the remarkable gains that Mr. Trump made in Passaic. In his first presidential run in 2016, Mr. Trump lost the city by more than 50 points. Last year, Mr. Trump carried the city, which is more than 70 percent Hispanic.\n\nPassaic, both the city and the surrounding county with the same name, is ground zero for how Mr. Trump scrambled the state’s traditional demographic allegiances in 2024. While Mr. Trump did better in each of the state’s 21 counties, compared with his performance four years earlier against former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his biggest improvements were in the most diverse areas.\n\nDespite his gains, Mr. Trump still lost Hispanic voters nationally, and the Sherrill campaign has worked — in English and in Spanish — to tie Mr. Ciattarelli to a president with sagging approval ratings.\n\nThere is no guarantee that Mr. Ciattarelli can match — let alone surpass — Mr. Trump’s showing last year, when the president did far better than expected, but still lost New Jersey by six points. Mr. Ciattarelli also must exceed his performance from four years ago, when frustration over pandemic-related mandates drove Republicans to the polls and Mr. Ciattarelli came within three points of beating the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Philip D. Murphy.\n\nBut to have any chance to wresting control of a state with roughly 850,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, Mr. Ciattarelli will have to make inroads in traditional Democratic terrain and with the 2.3 million voters who are not registered with either party.\n\nThe battle for Hispanic voters has been on full display in pre-election editions of the Spanish-language newspaper, El Especialito. As early voting began, Ms. Sherrill and the Democratic ticket were featured in five full-page ads while an interview with Mr. Ciattarelli ran next to a full-page ad of his own.\n\nEl Especialito and another Spanish-language newspaper, Americano, endorsed Ms. Sherrill and ran her photograph on their covers.\n\nShe also has broad institutional party support and last week, ahead of the first weekend of early, in-person voting, she won a key endorsement from nearly 150 Black faith leaders.\n\nOn Saturday, former President Barack Obama is set to be in Newark, the state’s largest city, with Ms. Sherrill. Senator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat whose mother emigrated from Colombia and whose father is Mexican, is expected to campaign with her on Sunday in West New York and Long Branch.\n\nRepresentative Linda Sánchez, a California Democrat who leads the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said policies Mr. Trump had enacted during his second term were eroding the electoral gains he made in 2024.\n\n“Trump’s support among Latinos isn’t growing — it’s crumbling,” she said. “From the rising cost of living to reckless deportation policies, our community feels betrayed.”\n\nBut in New Jersey, Mr. Ciattarelli’s efforts have shown early dividends. He has been endorsed by a handful of Democratic politicians, including Nicholas Sacco, the longtime mayor of North Bergen, in Hudson County. He won an endorsement last week from more than 100 Latino pastors and he is drawing newly minted Republicans like Adela Rohenda to campaign events.\n\nMs. Rohenda is 67 and lives in Jersey City. She traveled to a recent Ciattarelli event in Clifton carrying a Puerto Rican flag. She explained that she first voted for Mr. Trump, in 2016, because her son convinced her that a Trump presidency would give him a better chance at finding a job.\n\nMore recently, she has turned away from the Democratic Party over the issue of crime. “Now I’m Republican,” Ms. Rohenda said in an interview. “I voted Democrat 40 years.”\n\nSome of Ms. Sherrill’s allies have expressed concern that she has been slow to try to make up ground that Mr. Ciattarelli covered extensively while running for governor in three consecutive races.\n\nRafael Collazo, the executive director of UnidosUS Action PAC, which has endorsed Ms. Sherrill, said “the big dynamic is they don’t know her.”\n\n“They don’t want to support Ciattarelli,” he added, “but a lot of them don’t know Mikie Sherrill.”\n\nMs. Sherrill has shown up at Jersey City’s Puerto Rican Day Parade, Perth Amboy’s Hispanic Heritage Month Picnic and Union City’s 50th Annual Hispanic Parade, along with many other cultural events. At the same time, her campaign has invested heavily in Spanish-language advertising, where the Ciattarelli campaign has been mostly absent.\n\nKennith Gonzalez, a former executive director of New Jersey’s Republican Party now helping oversee Hispanic outreach for Mr. Ciattarelli, panned Ms. Sherrill’s ad strategy as cynical.“Let me do all of these Spanish ads only connecting Jack with Trump. And let’s not offer anything, because the Hispanic community is too stupid to really care about the issues,” he said. “We just want to scare them with Trump.”\n\nAs the head of the Statewide Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in New Jersey, Carlos Medina is used to being courted by politicians, but he said there was a feeling among some Black and Hispanic voters “that the Democratic Party has abandoned them and only comes around in an election.”\n\nAfter Ms. Sherrill was unable to attend several events sponsored by the business group, Mr. Medina said he had offered her an “olive branch” to speak virtually to his members at her convenience. Mr. Ciattarelli participated, but she sent her running mate instead. “I was pretty shocked,” he said.\n\nThen, when Democrats used a clip from Mr. Ciattarelli’s appearance to attack him for being dismissive of “Black and Hispanic communities,” Mr. Medina said he was bewildered. “Now I’m being used as some sort of pawn in this argument,” he said in an interview.\n\nSean Higgins, a spokesman for Ms. Sherrill, said she had “partnered directly with Black and Latino communities.”\n\nOf Mr. Ciattarelli’s efforts, he said: “Like a typical career politician, he tells groups what they want to hear — but he has never stood up for the Black or Latino community with his vote or his voice, and has now pledged his loyalty to Trump over the people of New Jersey.”\n\nM. Teresa Ruiz, the Democratic majority leader in the State Senate who is among Ms. Sherrill’s strongest supporters, said the national Democratic Party had to “do much better” speaking with — not over — diverse communities like the one she represented in Newark.\n\n“The work to build back the party has to continue,” she said. “We have to motivate people to get up off the sofas, to feel engaged, to feel recognized.”\n\nJoshua Rodriguez, the pastor of Cityline Church, where Mr. Ciattarelli spoke on Sunday in Jersey City, said he remained puzzled by Mr. Trump’s ability to persuade Latino voters, given his efforts to significantly increase deportations.\n\n“Trump definitely moved the needle a bunch in terms of the Latino vote,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “Will Jack be able to do that? That’s what we’ll find out next week.”\n\nChristine Zhang contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/world/europe/king-charles-prince-andrew.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"11:25:48-04:00","title":"Will the Unmaking of a Prince Be the Making of a King?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III has taken decisive action to strip Prince Andrew, Duke of York, of all his royal titles and privileges, following a decade of public scrutiny and allegations of sexual misconduct tied to Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Roberts Giuffre.

Unmaking of a Prince Be the Making of a King?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T11:25:48-04:00\n\nWhen Prince Charles ascended the throne in 2022, royal watchers predicted he would be a cautious reformer, edging Britain’s ancient monarchy toward a more open, inclusive and accountable style. Few predicted that exiling his wayward younger brother, Andrew, would be a defining moment in that project.\n\nKing Charles III’s decision this week to strip Andrew of his title as a prince, turning him into Mr. Mountbatten Windsor, is a watershed in the history of the royal family — an act so legally complicated, politically sensitive and emotionally fraught that it left royal historians casting about for a precedent.\n\nAt one level, Charles’s move is a concession that a decade of half measures was not enough to quell the public outcry over allegations of sexual misconduct against Andrew and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender. At another level, it is an affirmation that royals, too, can be held accountable.\n\n“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement whose passive voice did little to disguise the hammer blow.\n\nFor those who parse royal communications, the next line was equally noteworthy. “Their Majesties,” the statement concluded, “wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”\n\nThat likely signaled the endorsement of Charles’s wife, Queen Camilla, who has never been close to Andrew, according to people who worked at the palace. She also supports charities that work for victims of rape and sexual abuse.\n\nPalace officials said the king’s elder son and heir to the throne, Prince William, also supported the decision. The current and former palace officials spoke on condition that they not be identified because of the sensitivity of discussing internal royal family matters.\n\nStill, the Firm, as royals often refer to their family, is neither a democracy nor a collective. The king made the decision to send so-called royal warrants to the lord chancellor, David Lammy. In these, he requested that Mr. Lammy remove Andrew’s titles — Duke of York and prince — as well as the honorific “His Royal Highness” from the Peerage Roll, which sets out royal and aristocratic titles in Britain.\n\nThe maneuver will bypass the need for Parliament to act against Andrew, 65, a prospect that was becoming uncomfortably plausible after calls by several lawmakers to address the slurry of sordid disclosures about the accusation that he raped a teenager, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who was trafficked to him by Mr. Epstein.\n\nAndrew has repeatedly denied these allegations, which Ms. Giuffre detailed in a newly published memoir, “Nobody’s Girl.” She died by suicide in Australia in April. (Mr. Epstein died, also in a suicide, while awaiting trial in 2019.)\n\nLast week, a member of Parliament, Rachael Maskell, introduced a bill that would give the king the authority to rescind royal titles on his own initiative. Charles appears to have found another way to do this, though it will require the cooperation of Mr. Lammy, who also serves as deputy prime minister and justice minister. The palace officials said Charles had consulted the government and that it supported him.\n\nMr. Lammy, as the official responsible for maintaining the Peerage Roll, will have to remove the dukedom of York and the other titles. He is expected to comply without delay, which would short-circuit the need for further action in Parliament.\n\nThat is hardly surprising. The Labour government, like its predecessors, has shown no appetite to confront the royal family, reflecting centuries of convention under which the crown and Parliament try to stay out of each other’s affairs.\n\n“I’m delighted,” Chris Bryant, the government’s trade minister, told the BBC about the king taking the initiative. “I’ve felt for a long time this was a necessary step, and I’m glad that it’s happening now.”\n\nOpposition leaders agreed. “The public has no truck whatsoever with any kind of sexual abuse, sexual offenses, especially of minors,” said the leader of the Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, in a radio interview.\n\nThe leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said on social media, “It’s clear that Andrew’s position had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.” He added, “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”\n\nWhether it will definitively do that is not yet clear, though royal watchers said the magnitude of this step dwarfed previous punishments. The king had previously instructed Andrew not to use his Duke of York title and to forgo being addressed as “His Royal Highness.” But Andrew remained a prince, and his other titles were merely held in abeyance.\n\nNow he will lose all those titles, as well as his princely home outside London, the Royal Lodge, from which the king is evicting him. As in many family disputes, real estate proved to be one of the biggest bones of contention.\n\nUnder a deal between Andrew and the Crown Estate, which owns the lodge, he was able to live there for a nominal annual rent — specified, in traditional English terms, as “one peppercorn (if demanded)” — in return for having paid a large sum upfront to renovate the 30-room residence. The BBC reported he had paid around 8 million pounds, or $10.7 million.\n\nCharles could not simply break that “cast-iron lease,” according to palace officials. So the king, the Crown Estate and Andrew negotiated a deal under which Andrew agreed to surrender it. The Crown Estate may compensate Andrew for his investment in the property. He will move to a smaller house on Sandringham, a royal estate northeast of London that the king personally owns.\n\nSarah Ferguson, whom Andrew divorced in 1996 but who continued to live with him in the Royal Lodge, will not move to Sandringham, according to a palace official. Palace officials emphasized that their two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, would keep their titles.\n\nThat underlines the emotional toll of this drama for the royal family. The palace said that the king had a “duty of care” for Andrew and his daughters. That was another reason for the delay in taking these harsher measures, they said. Although Charles and Andrew are not especially close, according to two people who worked for the palace, the king has been anguished by the human impact of the scandal.\n\nAt the same time, royal watchers said, Charles’s actions showed that he — like Queen Elizabeth II before him — will ultimately put the interests of the crown first. After Andrew gave a disastrous interview in 2019 to the BBC about his friendship with Mr. Epstein, Charles, then the Prince of Wales, called his mother from New Zealand to press her to strip his brother of his public duties.\n\nIt was a moment, royal watchers said, that laid bare Charles’s rising influence in the family. But as king, he has had his own trials. His three-year-old reign has been shadowed by his treatment for cancer. Although he has kept up a busy travel schedule, analysts say his health has impeded his other reform efforts.\n\nNow, in acting decisively to punish Andrew, Charles has moved on at least one of those: He has introduced accountability to an institution often faulted by critics for living by its own rules.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/nyregion/2025-nyc-marathon-guide.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"03:00:09-04:00","title":"Your Guide to the 2025 New York City Marathon","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 New York City Marathon, the 54th edition, is set to take place on Sunday, November 2, 2025, with over 50,000 runners from around the world participating in a 26.2-mile course that begins in Staten Island and ends in Central Park.

2025-10-30T03:00:09-04:00\n\nIn a few days, people all over New York City will be focused on a big race, full of colorful slogans and signs.\n\nNo, not the mayoral election. Sunday is the 54th New York City Marathon. Fifty thousand runners from all over the globe will be at the starting line, and thousands more New Yorkers will come out along the 26.2 mile course to cheer them as they attempt to finish what many consider the most challenging of the seven major marathons.\n\nWhether you’re running, cheering or maybe just trying to get around the city on Sunday to early vote, here’s what you need to know:\n\nLast year, the New York Road Runners, which organizes the event, tested out crossing zones in two locations in Brooklyn so that spectators and New Yorkers trying to get around had a way to cross the course. This year, they added two more in Manhattan.\n\nFollow the instructions of the volunteers at these spots to cross.\n\nBrooklyn: Lafayette Avenue and Fulton Street near Atlantic Terminal\n\nBrooklyn: Bedford and Broadway in Williamsburg\n\nManhattan: First Avenue at 72nd Street\n\nManhattan: First Avenue and 86th Street\n\nFor runners, the pre-race bag drop has moved to Central Park West between 69th and 70th streets on Friday and Saturday. Ted Metellus, the marathon’s director, said they moved it because people had trouble finding the bandshell near 72nd Street that the Road Runners used in previous years.\n\nAlso, the Road Runners have consolidated to one phone app. If people have already downloaded the NYRR app, they do not need to download a new one.\n\nWith partly cloudy skies and temperatures starting near 45 and warming to 57 by the afternoon, Sunday is shaping up to be decent for both runners and spectators. There will be a slight wind chill when the first waves start, but not unbearable. There also might be slight humidity in the air near the start but probably not bad and diminishing as the later waves begin their race.\n\nAfter the elite men’s race begins, the remaining runners are divided into five waves based on their expected finish times. This prevents runners from getting too jammed up in the early stages.\n\n8 a.m. Professional men’s wheelchair division\n\n8:02 a.m. Professional women’s wheelchair division\n\n8:22 a.m. Handcycle category and select athletes with disabilities\n\n8:35 a.m. Professional women\n\n9:05 a.m. Professional men\n\n9:10 a.m. Wave 1 of the remaining runners\n\n9:45 a.m. Wave 2\n\n10:20 a.m. Wave 3\n\n10:55 a.m. Wave 4\n\n11:30 a.m. Wave 5\n\nThe race begins on Staten Island, and then turns north through Brooklyn and Queens. Next, runners head west across the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan, north into the Bronx and back to Manhattan. The finish line is in Central Park, near the West 60s\n\nwillis ave. Br.\n\nQueensboro Br.\n\nPulaski  Br.\n\nWilliamsburg\n\nFourth ave.\n\nVerrazzano-\n\nNarrows Br.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nHere’s a tour of the course from a runner’s perspective and more information from New York Road Runners.\n\nMost of the course, except for some bridges, is open to spectators. Here’s our full guide on where to watch the race, depending on what kind of experience you want to have.\n\nIf you’re looking for somewhere to watch that’s easy to reach from other parts of the city, you could go to Fourth and Flatbush Avenues in Brooklyn, near the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center station, which is served by the B, D, N, Q, R, 2, 3, 4 and 5 trains and the Long Island Rail Road.\n\nIf you’re looking for a place where your cheers could make a big difference, go to the Bronx. Mile 20, around 135th Street and Alexander Avenue, is a notoriously challenging part of the course where some runners hit the proverbial wall.\n\nAnd if you like to do your cheering in a crowd, the stretch of First Avenue from 59th to 96th Street in Manhattan, which is lined with bars and restaurants, is always jammed with spectators.\n\n9:30 a.m. Professional men’s wheelchair athletes\n\n9:40 a.m. Professional women’s wheelchair athletes\n\n11 a.m. Professional women\n\n11:15 a.m. Professional men\n\n11:55 a.m. on Remaining runners start crossing the finish line\n\n8:30 p.m. on Final runners start crossing the finish line\n\nLast year, the final two finishers arrived just after 9:30 p.m.\n\nThe upper level of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which connects Staten Island and Brooklyn, will close at 11 p.m. on Saturday and reopen at 4 p.m. on Sunday. The lower level will close at 7 a.m. on Sunday and reopen at 4 p.m. the same day.\n\nOther roads along the route will close starting from 6:30 to 9 a.m. on Sunday. Roads will reopen after most runners have passed through, starting at 6:30 p.m. in the early miles through 10:30 p.m. for First Avenue.\n\nThere will still be runners out along the route even after roads reopen, but they are supposed to move to the sidewalks.\n\nNo. While bicyclists used to routinely ride the course in the early morning hours despite it being officially against the rules, in 2023 a cyclist hit a pedestrian. Last year, the Road Runners cracked down on the practice, and they are repeating the warning this year as well: Anybody who tries to ride a bike on the course after roads close will be removed.\n\nIf you’re watching from home, you can catch the race live on ESPN2 and in Spanish on ESPN3 from 8 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. In New York, it will air locally on WABC-TV, Channel 7, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., with a view of the finish line from 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nABC will also broadcast from the finish line from 3 to 5 p.m. nationally, well after the pro runners finish, to showcase celebrity and regular runners as they complete the race.\n\nThe NYRR app will have uninterrupted livestreaming of all four professional races (men’s and women’s, wheelchair and open divisions) in full, as well as cameras streaming the entire race from certain locations along the course.\n\nThe app also allows you to track runners in real time.\n\nThere are plenty of well-known people in the race this year, some of whom are running  for the first time. Anthony Ramos, who was in the original cast of “Hamilton,” is running his first marathon with his brother, a high school guidance counselor, and with the Olympic marathoner Des Linden, who is coaching Mr. Ramos. Oliver Phelps, who played George Weasley in the Harry Potter movies, is also running his first marathon.\n\nSome musicians are running as well, including Ben Gibbard and Dave Depper from Death Cab for Cutie and N.O.R.E., a Queens native and hip-hop star. And “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” reality shows are always well-represented, with Joey Graziadei, Tyler Cameron, Matt James, Zac Clark, Joe Amabile and Tanner Courtad all running.\n\nHere are the other celebrities running the race, several of whom are raising money for a charity:\n\nBryan Arenales\n\nNic Vansteenberghe\n\nAlexi Pappas\n\nPhil Keoghan\n\nClaire Holt\n\nChloe Lukasiak\n\nOlivia Maher\n\nTayshia Adams\n\nChristine Doan\n\nIsabelle Glasgow Jensen\n\nKaren Sarahi Gonzalez\n\nLauren Ridloff\n\nNev Schulman\n\nPatina Miller\n\nMerle Dandridge\n\nJordan Litz\n\nErrol Barnett\n\nIsaac Rochell\n\nRudy Valdez\n\nCasey Neistat\n\nBrooke Monk\n\nJudson Jones contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/science/nasa-moon-lander-spacex-blue-origin.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"19:34:53-04:00","title":"NASA Gets Moon Lander Plan B’s From SpaceX and Blue Origin","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NASA is accelerating its Artemis III mission to land astronauts on the Moon near the south pole before the end of President Trump’s second term in January 2029.

astronauts to the surface of the moon. And now, it has some.\n\nOn Wednesday, the space companies owned by two of the richest people on Earth — Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin — submitted ideas to the space agency for a faster program to land astronauts near the lunar south pole under the Artemis III mission.\n\nThe proposals follow appearances by Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation who is temporarily also serving as the head of NASA, on cable news networks last week. He said NASA was looking to accelerate its return-to-the-moon program known as Artemis, and the next landing of NASA astronauts would occur before President Trump’s second term ends in January 2029.\n\nSpaceX currently has a $2.9 billion contract to build a version of its gargantuan Starship rocket to serve as the lander for Artemis III. But after several failed test flights of Starship this year, leaving major technological hurdles yet to be cleared, Mr. Musk’s company is running behind schedule.\n\nThat means that the next footprints on the moon could be made by astronauts from China, which is aiming to send its astronauts to the moon’s surface by 2030.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, NASA went to SpaceX and Blue Origin, which has a contract to build a lander for later Artemis missions, and asked if they could come up with alternative designs for Artemis III that would be quicker to build.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The order levied a $113,000 penalty on the physician, Dr. Margaret Carpenter, and barred her from continuing to send abortion medication to Texas.\n\nMr. Paxton’s efforts had been rebuffed earlier this year by the acting clerk of Ulster County, N.Y. The clerk, Taylor Bruck, refused to accept Mr. Paxton’s legal filing, citing New York’s shield law, designed to protect health care providers who prescribe abortion pills by telemedicine and send them to patients in states with abortion bans.\n\nUnder shield laws, which about 20 states have adopted in some form, the authorities are prevented from obeying subpoenas, extradition requests and other legal actions that other states take against abortion providers. The laws are a stark departure from typical interstate practices of cooperating in legal matters.\n\nOn Friday, Ulster County Judge David M. Gandin dismissed Mr. Paxton’s lawsuit against Mr. Bruck, ruling that it “fails to set forth allegations sufficient to make out a claim of a violation of lawful procedure or an error of law.”\n\nHe said that because “the medical services Dr. Carpenter rendered are legal in New York State,” her conduct “falls squarely within the definition of ‘legally protected health activity’” under the shield law. “In fact, her activities were the precise type of conduct” the shield law “was designed to protect,” the judge wrote.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Food Stamp Benefits\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T17:18:24-04:00\n\nA federal judge ordered the Trump administration to continue paying for food stamps during the government shutdown. The judge sided with nonprofits and local officials who had warned that many poor Americans rely on the benefits to buy groceries.\n\nIt was the second of two rulings in the span of about an hour that found the administration had acted unlawfully after it had refused to tap an emergency reserve for the SNAP program that was enacted by Congress.\n\nIt is not yet clear, however, when the money might actually reach the roughly 42 million people who receive the federal help, or the amount that they would receive. The judge ordered distribution of funds “as soon as possible,” but the Trump administration has said that distribution could take weeks. The Justice Department could try to appeal, perhaps further delaying aid.\n\nWithout a last-minute intervention, the decades-old safety net program is set to run out of funds on Nov. 1, more than four weeks into a shutdown seemingly without an end in sight. President Trump called last night for the Senate to eliminate the filibuster so it could pass new legislation to fund the government, but the Republican majority leader, John Thune, was not interested.\n\nThe shutdown has also contributed to a shortage in air traffic controllers, who went without their payday this week. It has led to travel delays.\n\nAs we head into the final weekend before Election Day, Democrats in California are optimistic about their effort to pass a redistricting referendum that could oust as many as five Republican House members next year. Polls show the measure passing by a healthy margin, fueled in part by opposition to Trump.\n\nDemocrats are also leading in polls in Virginia and New Jersey, which will each elect a new governor on Tuesday. In New Jersey, their lead is narrow, and the Republican candidate’s path to victory could be through the Black and Hispanic voters Trump made inroads with.\n\nIn other election news:\n\nOhio Republicans pushed through a new congressional map that would give the party 12 red-leaning districts.

The more points a unit gets, the more weapons and gear it can acquire through a government website.\n\nBadly outnumbered on the nation’s top court, the liberal justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson are split over the best approach.

He Was Let Go.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T09:43:56-04:00\n\nUntil recently, Forrest Smith was the sole employee at the National Park Service responsible for cleaning up dozens of abandoned oil and gas wells at national parks across the country.\n\nBut last month, the Park Service did not renew Mr. Smith’s four-year contract.\n\nNow it is unclear whether anyone will clean up an estimated 93 abandoned wells on federal lands managed by the Park Service. The wells are at high risk of spewing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere and contaminating groundwater, posing significant threats to the environment and public health.\n\n“There’s nobody left in the national parks who can confidently oversee this work with the expertise that I have,” Mr. Smith, 40, said in an interview. “I don’t think you could just pick somebody up and throw them in and expect them to do a really great job.”\n\nOld oil wells dot federal lands across the country. Most were drilled before the national parks were established. In many cases, the companies that owned the wells went bankrupt and deserted the sites, which are often called “orphaned” wells.\n\nScientists have found that orphaned wells can release methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, as well as benzene, a chemical linked to leukemia and other blood cancers. Oil and brine can also seep from the wells into aquifers that supply drinking water to nearby communities, research shows.\n\nMr. Smith had held the job since 2019 and said he was surprised that the Trump administration did not retain him, since it has generally prioritized workers and programs focused on fossil fuels, even during the government shutdown. “You’d think that in this administration, the petroleum engineer would be pretty protected,” he said.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, Mr. Smith was part of a four-person team that inspected and plugged abandoned wells with cement. The three other engineers left in recent months after accepting other jobs. The agency did not replace them, and it has not filled Mr. Smith’s role either, citing President Trump’s freeze on hiring civilian federal employees.\n\nElizabeth Peace, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, which oversees the Park Service, said in an email that the agency does not comment on personnel. She said the Park Service “has made strong progress in meeting the administration’s priorities to identify and plug orphaned wells on park lands,” and that “staffing levels naturally fluctuate as appointments conclude and new positions are filled.”\n\nThrough the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, Congress approved $4.7 billion for states, tribes and federal agencies like the Park Service and the Forest Service to plug abandoned wells nationwide. “Now that there’s no one to mind the shop, I’m concerned that either these projects will stop happening or there will be no one watching to ensure that our taxpayer dollars are being spent properly,” said Adam Peltz, a lawyer with the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group.\n\nMr. Smith estimated that there are around 2,500 inactive wells on Park Service lands, including 93 that are orphaned. Of those abandoned wells, about 70 are leaking methane, he said.\n\nMethane, which is responsible for roughly a third of all planetary warming, is colorless and odorless. Backpackers recently discovered a leaky well in Ohio’s Cuyahoga Valley National Park because the methane plume was making a loud hissing noise they heard from a nearby trail.\n\nOther leaky wells are spread across the scenic valleys and gorges of Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area in Tennessee and Kentucky. More are dotted across the bayou canals of Louisiana’s Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve.\n\nOverall, there are more than 168,000 orphaned wells within 30 miles of a national park, according to an analysis by two advocacy groups, the National Parks Conservation Association and FracTracker Alliance. There are likely many more wells that have not yet been documented, experts say.\n\n“I don’t think I can underscore enough that this has been a significantly underestimated public health and safety problem,” said Beau Kiklis, associate director of energy and landscape conservation at the National Parks Conservation Association.\n\nOutside of national parks, states are still plugging orphaned wells using grants from the bipartisan infrastructure law. The Interior Department has continued to distribute these grants, even as the Trump administration has clawed back billions of dollars in other climate money. (In July, the agency said grant recipients no longer needed to study the effects of well cleanups on endangered species or historical artifacts.)\n\nIn Pennsylvania, where natural gas has long powered the economy, the state’s environmental protection office is working to plug 59 wells using federal funding, spokesman Neil Shader said in an email. The department has sealed an additional 315 wells since Gov. Josh Shapiro took office in 2023, he said.\n\nAt the Park Service, well-plugging expeditions are complicated affairs. Workers often lug heavy construction equipment across deserts, forests, mountains and other rough terrain. On site, they pump the well pipes with layers of cement, sealing them, according to Mr. Smith.\n\nAfter leaving the Park Service last month, Mr. Smith scrambled to find a new job. His efforts paid off, and this month he started a new position as the director of engineering at TAQ Energy, a Denver-based oil and gas consulting firm.\n\nThere, he has continued to focus on plugging orphaned wells, this time partnering with states and private companies instead of the federal government.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/business/economy/wealth-tax-france.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:09:54-04:00","title":"Are Wealth Taxes the Best Way to Tax the Ultra Rich?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing global debate over wealth taxes is centering on whether taxing total assets — such as real estate, art, yachts, and private jets — rather than income can address extreme wealth concentration.

One idea, though, arouses particularly fevered reactions: A tax on wealth, not just paychecks.\n\nA clash over such a plan is now dividing France, where there was a raucous debate in Parliament on Friday over proposals for a wealth tax. But the approach has been roiling politics in the United States and Europe for years as inequality has risen to staggering levels and public debt has busted government budgets.\n\nAt the Labour Party conference in Britain in October, delegates called for a wealth tax. Surveys have shown three-quarters of Britons back the idea. Debate over the concept has been revived even in countries like Germany and Ireland that had previously repealed their wealth taxes. And the Tax Observatory, a research organization funded by the European Union, has proposed a global minimum wealth tax of 2 percent on the world’s roughly 3,000 billionaires.\n\nTo supporters, taxing an individual’s total assets — stocks, real estate, yachts, diamond tiaras, race horses, art, fine wines, private islands and jets — rather than just income is one of the few ways to get people with dynastic wealth to pay their fair share.\n\nIt is also necessary, they argue, to dilute the increasing political power of the super rich.\n\nTo opponents, wealth taxes are outlandish penalties on innovation and productivity, and discourage investment and cripple growth. They would also be a logistical nightmare to administer, they add. How would government tax collectors go about assessing a family’s valuable collections of Ferraris, Chippendales, Picassos, NFTs and Birken bags every year?\n\nWealth taxes, though not as common as some other levies, have actually been around for a long time. If you think about it, real estate taxes are one form of a wealth tax that target a particular asset.\n\nIn the 17th century, colonists in Massachusetts imposed a wealth tax on financial holdings, land, ships, jewelry and livestock. The first national wealth tax was imposed in the Netherlands in 1892. Colombia introduced one in 1935 as did India in 1957.\n\nWealth taxes were popular in Europe at times. Twelve countries had versions in 1990, although in many — including Germany, Sweden, Denmark Austria, Finland, Luxembourg — the taxes were later repealed.\n\nNorway, Switzerland and Spain have wealth taxes, according to the Tax Foundation. France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands tax certain types of assets, though not overall net wealth.\n\nThe reasons for the repeals, as detailed in a 2018 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, included the difficulty of administration, the burden on people who owned valuables but had little available cash, and the minimal amounts of revenue raised.\n\nBut there has been a revival of support for wealth taxes on the ultra rich in recent years, and much of it can be traced to three French economists — Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman — who did groundbreaking work starting in the early 2010s documenting the stunning concentration of wealth around the world. Globally, the top 1 percent own roughly 43 percent of the world’s total wealth, according to Oxfam.\n\nIn France, one proposal, a tax on households with a net worth of more than 100 million euros ($115.4 million), was aptly known as the Zucman tax. He estimates it would raise up to €20 billion from 1,800 households.\n\nAfter an acrimonious debate in the National Assembly on Friday, multiple variations of that tax were defeated.\n\n“We are against this tax mania,” Laurent Wauquiez, a lawmaker for France’s conservative Les Republicans party, said of the Zucman tax. “By taxing everything, you’ll have nothing left to tax, and you’ll also discourage entrepreneurs and workers.”\n\nFrançois Ruffin, a left-leaning lawmaker, defended the tax saying it was a “measly 2 percent.” In eight years, “the fortunes of the 500 wealthiest families have doubled by €600 billion, by 100 percent,\" he added. “We’re taking 2 percent from them, not leaving them 2 percent.”\n\nIn the United States, proposals for wealth taxes entered the mainstream during the final year of President Trump’s first term. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both presidential candidates, offered plans based on work by Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman that they said were aimed at avoiding the shortcomings of failed European wealth taxes.\n\nAnd after President Joseph R. Biden Jr. took office, Senate Democrats introduced a wealth tax aimed at billionaires, though it did not pass.\n\nIn 2020, Bolivia instituted what is arguably the best named wealth tax — Impuesto a las Grandes Fortunas, or Tax on Great Fortunes — which applied to people with net wealth over $4.3 million.\n\nAlthough concerns about inequality may prompt public support for wealth taxes, economic shocks and tight budgets historically have been the most common causes of their passage, researchers have found.\n\nIn the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Spain introduced a temporary “solidarity wealth tax” in 2022 on individuals with net assets above €3 million. It was later made permanent.\n\nSlowing growth and intense budget pressures have further ratcheted up interest in wealth taxes.\n\nLast year, the Brazilian government, which held the presidency of the Group of 20 nations, commissioned Mr. Zucman to devise a global plan to tax billionaires. That approach is intended to blunt worries that the super rich will take the money and run to a lower tax haven.\n\nWhatever other objections critics of wealth taxes may have, the fear that it and other presumed financial disincentives would disrupt the economy are often overblown, Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee, Nobel Prize winners in economics, have argued.\n\nProfessional athletes don’t reduce their efforts when there are salary caps. Increasing top tax rates tends to prompt more tax evasion, they said, but research shows they don’t cause the rich to work less.\n\nIn France, after the tax proposals were defeated on Friday, Mr. Zucman appeared on television and said: “I am not disappointed, because it will eventually happen.”\n\n“There’s a huge demand by the public for a tax on billionaires,” he added. “All battles of this nature take time to win.”\n\nLiz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/world/europe/selma-van-de-perre-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:22:19-04:00","title":"Selma van de Perre, Dutch Jew Who Resisted Nazis, Dies at 103","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Selma van de Perre, a Dutch Jewish woman who resisted Nazi occupation during World War II, died at age 103 in London.

Nazis, Dies at 103\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T13:22:19-04:00\n\nSelma van de Perre, a valiant Jewish secretary who during World War II covertly transported suitcases bulging with cash, seditious newsletters, identity cards and ration books to Dutch resistance agents, even penetrating Nazi headquarters in Paris, died on Oct. 20 in London. She was 103.\n\nHer death was confirmed by the Dutch Embassy in London.\n\nMs. van de Perre was 17 when the Nazis invaded the Netherlands in May 1940. In only four days, they subjugated a nation of fewer than nine million people, from which they deported more Jews — both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the total Jewish population — than from any other Western European country.\n\nMs. van de Perre avoided deportation — to work camps or worse — first by feigning illness, then by masquerading as a nurse, and finally by being recruited by a Jewish furrier in Amsterdam to make gloves for the German Army. She joined the Dutch resistance, adopted aliases and dyed her hair blond to help her pass as a non-Jew.\n\n“I, fortunately, was strong — physically and mentally,” she wrote in a memoir, “My Name Is Selma,” published in both English and Dutch in 2020 and later in other languages.\n\n“I didn’t know exactly what I was capable of,” she wrote, “but I felt resilient enough — perhaps because my childhood had been something of a roller-coaster ride — to do more than just hide myself away.”\n\nWhen the memoir was published, Caroline Moorehead wrote of Ms. van de Perre in The Times Literary Supplement of London that “it is impossible not to marvel at her steadiness and courage.”\n\nOperating under the pseudonyms Wilhelmena Buter and Margareta van der Kuit, she forged documents, helped Jewish families find shelter in Christian homes, and delivered secret papers — including once to a contact at Nazi headquarters in Paris, which she infiltrated by flirting with the German soldiers who were guarding the front door.\n\nBut in June 1944, German police officers discovered her in an apartment in Utrecht. She was first interned at the Herzogenbusch concentration camp (known to the Dutch as Vught) in the Netherlands, where she helped sabotage the gas masks that inmates were forced to make for German troops.\n\nShe was then transferred to Ravensbrück, north of Berlin, the largest camp for women in Germany. There she endured beatings, life-threatening disease and starvation, and was made to work in a nearby factory making airplane components.\n\nShe was rescued by the Swedish Red Cross in April 1945, but she was nearly killed when the trucks carrying her and other prisoners to freedom were mistaken for an enemy convoy and strafed by Royal Air Force fighters.\n\nAfter she finally made it to Sweden, and then to England — where she joined her two older brothers, who had served in the British armed forces during the war — she learned that her father, mother, sister, grandmother, aunt, uncle and two cousins had all been murdered by the Nazis.\n\nSelma Velleman was born on June 7, 1922, in Amsterdam, the third child of Barend Levi Velleman — who defied his parents’ hope that he would become a rabbi and had an up-and-down career as an actor and singer under the name Ben Velmon — and Femmetje (Spier) Velleman, a milliner.\n\nHer older brothers celebrated their bar mitzvahs, but the family was not observant. When Selma was 7, she spent eight months in a sanitarium recuperating from pleurisy and pneumonia, but she returned to school, got good grades and aspired to work at a prestigious department store as either a secretary or a bookkeeper. At the time of the Nazi invasion, she was working for a paper company.\n\nBut on June 7, 1942, weeks after the invasion, she was told she would be drafted into a labor camp in Eastern Europe. Her father was deported. Her mother and younger sister went into hiding; soon after that, she joined the resistance.\n\nThe Nazis never discovered that she was Jewish; when she was captured, she was classified as a political prisoner.\n\nAfter she was liberated and reunited with her brothers in England, she taught sociology and mathematics at a high school in London; studied anthropology at the London School of Economics; and joined the Dutch-language radio service of the British Broadcasting Corporation, where she met a Flemish journalist, Hugo van de Perre.\n\nThey married in 1955 and had a son, Jocelin. After her husband died, in 1979, Ms. van de Perre worked as a cultural correspondent for several media outlets and became a British citizen. (Information about her survivors was not immediately available.)\n\nIn 1983, Ms. van de Perre was awarded the Resistance Memorial Cross by the Dutch government. Since 1995, she had returned every year to Ravensbrück as part of a program to remind students of what happened there.\n\nIn 2021, the PBS news anchor Christiane Amanpour asked Ms. van de Perre whether she was bitter about the war.\n\n“Bitter?” she replied. “That’s a difficult word. No, I’m not bitter, but I don’t forgive the people who did those things, the Nazis. They were horrible people and deserved to be killed when they were killed. But I’m not bitter against the Germans. I wouldn’t be intolerant like that.”\n\nOn Sept. 5, 1944, as she was preparing to be transferred from Vught, 200 male inmates were massacred by their Nazi guards. Nonetheless, the next day, after boarding the train to Ravensbrück, she managed to maintain her equanimity.\n\nIn her memoir, she wrote that she scrawled a note on toilet paper to a girlfriend and slipped it through the slats of the cattle car in which she was crammed, hoping that someone would find it and pass it on.\n\nIn 1995, as that girlfriend was moving into a new house, she found the note. It had apparently been found near the tracks by a railroad worker and forwarded to her, but she had forgotten about it for 50 years.\n\n“Keep your spirits up,” the note said. “I’ll do the same, although I do wish the end was in sight.”\n\nDespite her grievous losses, Ms. van de Perre expressed awe in her memoir at how many people became heroes during the war.\n\n“I can still hardly believe that people who should have remained unremarkable ended up memorialized on lists and monuments,” she wrote. “We were ordinary people plunged into extraordinary circumstances.”\n\n"}]}
