A storm surge of up to 16 feet flooded parts of the community as the hurricane barreled through. At least two people died here – their bodies discovered floating in the water after the storm had cleared, St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, at least 49 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  In Black river, hundreds of survivors are now walking through the streets in shock, trying to process the harrowing situation they face.\n \n\n   \n  Many have lost their homes and are wondering where they will go for shelter.\n \n\n   \n  “We live in a board house. Everything is gone – dressers, stove – everything is gone,” Samms said, sitting beside other residents next to shopping carts loaded with their remaining belongings.\n \n\n   \n  It was “a nice, quiet, very docile town,” said a man from a nearby town after surveying the devastation.

This delayed the authorities’ ability to deliver much-needed aid.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of residents were seen clearing out the shelves of a damaged supermarket out of desperation, taking basic needs such as food and water.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no looting,” a resident said to CNN. “This is trying to survive.

first-ever botanical curator, backed by Chanel Culture Fund \n       \n  By Fiona Sinclair Scott, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:26 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Fondation Beyeler, home to one of western Europe’s leading modern and contemporary art collections, is turning its gaze toward a novel type of gallery — its own gardens.\n \n\n   \n  Located near Basel, Switzerland, the museum has long been a popular cultural attraction for its art as well as its scenic setting. Designed by Pritzker Prize–winning architect  Renzo Piano , the flat-roofed, single-story gallery in Riehen is gently nestled among centuries-old trees and mossy lily ponds, surrounded by green fields and vineyards, at the edge of Germany’s Black Forest.\n \n\n   \n  Since opening nearly 30 years ago, the Fondation Beyeler has hosted many site-specific artworks that engaged directly with its natural environment. In 1998, the late artist  Christo  wrapped 178 trees on the property in fabric, and, more recently,  Olafur Eliasson  removed part of the building’s facade to effectively bring one of the outdoor ponds into the gallery itself. The Icelandic artist used a non-toxic dye to give the water a neon glow, describing the work as a “model for a future landscape where human and non-humans can live together” more harmoniously.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the institution is announcing a groundbreaking new role. In what is believed to be the first role of its kind at a major art museum, the Fondation Beyeler has appointed Swiss academic Rahel Kesselring as its inaugural botanical curator. Her role will focus on the preservation of the site’s flora and fauna and on developing public programming within its gardens.\n \n\n   \n  The position — officially, the Chanel botanical curator — is supported by the Chanel Culture Fund, a philanthropic arm of the French luxury house that backs innovative cultural projects and initiatives around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring explained that her mission is to strengthen the dialogue between art and nature. “Plants are enormously important for our culture,” she said in a video interview. “They sustain us…we live in a world that has been fully built by plants. We have a deep connection to them, physically, culturally and historically.”\n \n\n   \n  Museum director Sam Keller called the appointment a reflection of the institution’s ethos. “Nature is not a backdrop to our work, but a living part of it,” he said in a statement. “This role affirms our commitment to caring for the whole ecology of this place with the same depth, imagination and responsibility we bring to everything we do.”\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring’s appointment  presents a new model for arts institutions — expanding the idea of curatorial expertise beyond the white walls of a gallery and into the living landscape.\n \n\n   \n  With the symptoms of climate crisis increasingly felt by people and businesses, including those within the art world, the Fondation Beyeler is making a statement by putting ecological stewardship on par with artistic curation. Kesselring hopes it will inspire broader change or, at least, more public engagement. “We need to rewrite our understanding of our relationship with nature,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Yana Peel, the president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel, said during a video call that with no brick-and-mortar cultural institutions of its own (as is common for many luxury brands), the company has focused on contributing to others — seeking out ways to create impact on a project-by-project basis.\n \n\n   \n  “We have specifically not been sponsoring galas or parties or short-term projects,” she said, explaining that they want to focus on “transformational” work that is entirely non-transactional and not aimed at selling Chanel products. The initiative is about “wanting to have a positive impact on the world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chanel did not confirm how long it would be funding Kesselring’s role at the foundation but it’s understood to be a multi-year partnership, in keeping with the fund’s wider mission to focus on longer-term projects.\n \n\n   \n  Established five years ago, the Chanel Culture Fund has invested in 50 projects across 15 countries. Chanel is working with the Power Station of Art in Shanghai to support a significant renovation of the institution’s third-floor gallery, including the addition of the first contemporary art library in China, with the capacity to house 50,000 books. In Brazil, the fund partnered with the Pinacoteca de São Paulo on a new annual residency program to support women artists. And in the US, the organization is funding the Chanel Center for Artists and Technology at CalArts in Southern California.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Teacher shot by a 6-year-old student thought she was ‘on my way to heaven.’ What we learned from Abby Zwerner’s testimony","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abby Zwerner, a teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, was shot in the hand and chest by a 6-year-old student on January 6, 2023, during a classroom reading session.

I thought I had died,” Zwerner said with a catch in her voice as she recounted the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s   “blank look” as he aimed at her is a memory Zwerner said she can’t shake.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million  lawsuit  against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  Parker also faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect in the criminal trial against her next month.\n \n\n   \n  The case offers a window into what to expect for the upcoming criminal trial against Parker. Both trials raise questions about who is responsible when children with access to guns carry out school shootings, a pervasive problem across the country.\n \n\n   \n  As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we learned from Zwerner’s moving and highly anticipated testimony.\n \n\n   \n    Effects of shooting linger\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s devastating hand injury has left her unable to do everyday things like open a bottle of   water.\n \n\n   \n  “I was trying to open the bag of chips on my own multiple times, different ways — trying to hold it different ways,” she testified about a recent lunch with her attorney. “And I eventually asked you to open it.”\n \n\n   \n  Even after six surgeries, Zwerner’s hand will never be normal, an orthopedic surgeon testified this week.\n \n\n   \n  Previous testimony from doctors on her care team revealed Zwerner’s injuries were life-threatening after a bullet narrowly missed her heart. And the impacts extended beyond the physical damage, she testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner struggled to describe how she now feels around people, even loved ones, but indicated she feels a “distance” and “numbness.”\n \n\n   \n  Psychiatrist Dr. Clarence Watson testified Thursday Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  Even a planned outing to the movies to see “Hamilton,” which features a duel scene with guns, became an overwhelming task that left her in tears, Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n  When her mother asked her what she wanted to do instead, she felt resigned.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember saying or telling them, ‘nowhere, like I can’t go anywhere. I just want to stay home,’” Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n    Defense tries to undercut teacher’s testimony\n \n\n   \n  During cross-examination Thursday, an attorney for Parker worked to undermine Zwerner’s claims that the shooting has limited her willingness to go out in public.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had been emotionally ready to attend concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school, worked and frequented a gym if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, her doctor had cleared her to do light workouts and she tried her best to do that with weights, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  The defense also pressed Zwerner on whether there was more she could have done after learning of the possible gun threat.\n \n\n   \n  Another school staffer told her about the boy potentially having a gun and she did not inform Parker because she knew the other staffer was going to, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorneys are trying to paint a picture that Zwerner may have been “a little bit at fault” for not acting on information that she had, said Darryl K.

October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Leaders of Pacific countries and territories, including China’s Xi Jinping, are gathering in South Korea for a major summit Friday. But the leader of one global powerhouse is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The US president flew out of South Korea Thursday, moments after his  landmark meeting  with his Chinese counterpart that appeared to  de-escalate the protracted trade conflict  between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  With Trump choosing to skip the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation – which groups together countries accounting for more than half of global trade – Xi stepped into the limelight and will hold high-profile meetings, including with Japan’s new leader Sanae Takaichi and Canada’s Mark Carney.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his absence, Trump’s protectionist trade policies and punishing global tariffs loom over the two-day event in the city of Gyeongju. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is standing in for Trump during the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  In his opening remarks to the forum, Xi called for unity and cooperation between the grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific.\n \n\n   \n  “The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”\n \n\n   \n  “China’s door to openness will not close; it will only open wider,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year is on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.\n \n\n   \n  “We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “As the free trade order undergoes dramatic changes, global economic uncertainty is deepening, and trade and investment are losing momentum.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee said that “only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s three-leg tour of Asia, which stopped in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, was generally regarded as a success for all parties, with Asian leaders putting on a  masterclass in hospitality  and flattery as they sought to get the president on side — and ease trade negotiations in the process.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s meeting with Xi ended in a trade agreement that called for the US to lower tariffs on China by 10%, bringing the effective rate on Chinese exports down to 47%; and for China to delay some export controls on rare earths and resume purchases of American soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  In Japan, Trump and freshly appointed Prime Minister Takaichi embarked on a “new golden age” of relations and signed a critical minerals agreement. And a new trade deal reached with Lee would see South Korea invest billions of dollars in the US, including in shipbuilding, aerospace and technology,  according  to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Xi met Japan’s Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.\n \n\n   \n  Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi faces a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes. \n \n\n   \n  Xi also held meetings with Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, according to Chinese state media.\n \n\n   \n  In comments that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”\n \n\n   \n  Canada, he said, was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/china/xi-trump-us-china-deal-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:50:00-04:50","title":"After Trump Trade Meeting, It’s Advantage Xi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a brief but significant meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Gimhae International Airport in South Korea, China secured key trade concessions including a 10% reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods and a temporary halt to a U.S. rule that would have expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from purchasing U.S. tech.

\n       \n  Analysis by Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:50 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the dust begins to clear around a  less-than-two hour meeting  between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump at an airbase in South Korea on Thursday, it’s clear that China’s leaders have stacked up another win for their hardball strategy with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting did not secure a broad trade deal, but rather a return to an uneasy truce built on a handful of agreements meant to keep the relationship steady as the two sides move toward one.\n \n\n   \n  Xi walked away with a 10% reduction in 30% tariffs newly imposed by Trump on Chinese goods this year – in exchange for   ramping up efforts to control its role in the US fentanyl crisis. He also secured US agreement to put on hold a new rule that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American tech.\n \n\n   \n  Trump averted Beijing imposing an expanded set of restrictions that could have hamstrung global industries reliant on China’s rare earths minerals. China will also ramp up purchases of US soybeans and other agricultural products, US officials said. Both sides also paused port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors and will extend a truce on more elevated tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  On paper, it looks like a reasonable exchange – and one that delivers, at least for now, what both leaders (and the wider global economy) wanted: stability after a tumultuous year of sparring between the world’s economic heavyweights.\n \n\n   \n  But for Beijing, the agreements – which came with a side of effusive praise from Trump for Xi – are also a clear confirmation of the success of its strategy in how to handle Trump 2.0.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Beijing has been able to win valuable concessions on tariffs and export controls, while primarily conceding measures they only put out as retaliation against those from the US in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  Take soybeans, a key American export that saw Chinese purchases plunge this year over trade frictions.\n \n\n   \n  China agreed to purchase a minimum of 25 million metric tons of American soybeans annually for the next three years, US agricultural secretary Brooke Rollins  said  after the talks.\n \n\n   \n  But that baseline is still 1.8 million metric tons less than China’s soybean purchases last year, before the tensions, according to  US data .\n \n\n   \n  China’s highly nationalistic and censor-curated internet clocked all this on Friday, when social media commenters praised how “China really nailed this tariff war,” and observed that “Trump finally dealt with the mess Trump created.”\n \n\n   \n    China’s game plan\n \n\n   \n  The outlook is not all rosy for China.\n \n\n   \n  Even as tariffs from this year’s US trade spat have been whittled down to 20%, Chinese exporters still face what on average amounts to nearly 50% duties on their goods, with pre-existing duties factored in. That rate remains among the highest imposed on any country by the US. Washington meanwhile has seen  real progress  on its goal to narrow their trade deficit.\n \n\n   \n  And, while the deal has yet to be inked, Beijing may have made some true concessions on the fate of the social media app TikTok, after changing its tune on staunch opposition to a US law requiring the app’s Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its US business.\n \n\n   \n  China also remains blocked from accessing the highest-end US chips, a key weapon in the high-stakes AI race playing out between the two countries.\n \n\n   \n  But on the tech front, Beijing’s ability to push back by at least a year the new US rule which would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American technologies, is a major boon for Chinese firms.\n \n\n   \n  The now-suspended US effort to close loopholes could have ensnared some 20,000 more companies than are already on the list, according to  an analysis  by business intelligence firm WireScreen.\n \n\n   \n  That’s another win for Beijing’s strategy of using its near-total grip on the global rare earths supply chain as leverage against the US – a tactic it also deployed during a tariff escalation earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  And on China’s side, agreeing to defer for at least a year its expanded export control regime on rare earth minerals, which it announced as retaliation for the US blacklist expansion, is unlikely to be seen as a major setback in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  As one Chinese scholar, foreign policy analyst Shen Dingli, told CNN earlier this month, those measures were a “nuclear” option that Beijing knew wasn’t symmetrical – “but if China doesn’t use this weapon, China has little left to bargain with.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether Xi and Trump can manage to keep the detente as they work toward a broader deal and expected visits to each other’s countries in 2026 is the next big question.\n \n\n   \n  Canada, after all, knows first-hand that a trade truce struck with Trump  can quickly collapse. \n \n\n   \n  A range of pitfalls, both foreseeable and unexpected, in the US and China’s expansive rivalry could derail the newly-reached stabilty – and whatever deal is ultimately reached is  unlikely to address the deep-seated, structural issues between the two. \n \n\n   \n  But as Trump took off from South Korea’s Gimhae International Airport on Thursday, to return to a US stuck in the quagmire of a frozen government,   Xi stayed on  to join an international summit and tout China as a beacon for globalization, it’s clear the balance of power between them has shifted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/top-election-campaign-ads","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The Top 10 Fall Campaign Ads of the 2025 Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the final weeks of the 2025 off-year election campaigns, voters in key states like California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia were flooded with high-budget political ads.

CNN limited the list below to one advertisement per committee.) \n \n\n   \n    1. ‘Threatens,’ from opponents of California Democrats’ redistricting\n \n\n   \n  The top ad of the fall campaign season comes from the leading group opposing California Democrats’ redistricting push, “No on Prop 50: Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab.” Funded largely by Charles Munger Jr.,  a longtime supporter  of nonpartisan redistricting and heir of legendary investor Charles Munger, the group’s ad urges Californians to “protect your vote and democracy” and “vote No on Prop 50.” About $5 million has been spent on the ad so far, according to media tracking firm AdImpact. Opponents of the redistricting push have been splintered and  many are increasingly pessimistic  about Tuesday’s election.\n \n\n   \n    2. ‘Texts’ from Jason Miyares, Virginia’s Republican attorney general\n \n\n   \n   Violent text messages  sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, emerged as a lightning rod in Virginia’s off- campaigns, as Republicans have leaned into sharp criticism of Jones and linked him to other Democrats. “Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?” asks one ad from incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares, Jones’ Republican opponent.\n \n\n   \n    3. ‘Obama,’ from Gavin Newsom’s allied group for California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who has  staked significant political capital  on his state’s redistricting fight,  called in the 44th president  to help. “California, the whole nation is counting on you,” Barack Obama says in the ad.\n \n\n   \n    4. ‘Stick it to Trump,’ from Tom Steyer, backing California Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Financier Tom Steyer, a liberal mega-donor  who ran for president in 2020  and is eyeing California’s 2026 governor race,  waded into his state’s redistricting fight  earlier this month with a $12 million ad buy.  “You want to stick it to Trump? Vote yes on Prop 50,” one of his ads says. Steyer gave a boost to Democrats’ messaging campaign while also raising his profile ahead of a potential statewide run next year.\n \n\n   \n    5. ‘Predators,’ from supporters of Mikie Sherrill, Democrat running for New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s allies are running a spot accusing GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli of “voting against legislation that would protect children and young adults in cases of domestic and sexual violence,” according to a review of his record while serving in the state assembly compiled by  the New Jersey Independent . The ad warns, “Jack Ciattarelli should never be governor of New Jersey.” Ciattarelli’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the ad.\n \n\n   \n    6. ‘Day One,’ from Sherrill’s gubernatorial campaign\n \n\n   \n  One of Sherrill’s top campaign ads highlights her pledge to declare a state of emergency on utility costs on day one. Energy bills have  been a top issue  for New Jersey voters this year, with spiking utility rates and soaring demand on an aging grid. In New Jersey, residential rates have climbed by up to 20%, and the tri-state Regional Plan Association  found  that “increased demand from data centers is attributed to about two-thirds of the increased prices.”\n \n\n   \n    7. ‘Same But Worse,’ from Sherrill opponents\n \n\n   \n  Republicans, too, have honed in on energy bills as a key issue in the New Jersey’s gubernatorial race. Ciattarelli has argued Sherrill would continue policies from the outgoing administration of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy that he says contribute to the crunch. “More of the same, but worse,” Ciattarelli’s ad argues.\n \n\n   \n    8. ‘Protect Your Rights,’ from Democrats in Pennsylvania’s state supreme court vote\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 20 years since a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice lost a retention election. This fall,  three of the state’s liberal justices  are on the ballot. and Republicans are pressing for the chance to potentially flip the ideological balance of the battleground state high court. An ad from a Democratic group supporting the justices links the retention elections to abortion, saying the state Supreme Court is “our last line of defense.”\n \n\n   \n    9. ‘Speaking,’ from Abigail Spanberger, Democrat running for Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor of Virginia, has plastered voters’ screens with versions of an attack ad seizing on an unflattering moment from her rival, GOP nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. The ad splices clips of Earle-Sears declaring to a booing crowd, “I am speaking,” with criticism of Republican policies. “Winsome Earle-Sears is so far right, she’s wrong for Virginia,” the ad closes, echoing a Spanberger campaign refrain. (Earle-Sears  recently aired an ad  nodding to the “I am speaking” moment in which she says to the camera, “They pick your worst day.”)\n \n\n   \n    10. ‘Extreme Silence,’ from Spanberger opponents\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears and her Republican allies in the Virginia governor race have made transgender policies a focal point of their attack ads, criticizing Spanberger over her support for the Equality Act and pressing her for answers on youth sports and school bathrooms. An ad from one of the groups, Restoration of America PAC, claims Spanberger “is as extreme as it gets.” Spanberger has argued local school districts should decide their own youth participation policies.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/prince-andrew-scandal-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:32:00-04:32","title":"King Charles Banishes Brother Andrew from Royal Status – A Historic Royal Censure","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III has made a historic and unprecedented decision to strip his brother Prince Andrew of all royal titles and status, transforming him into a commoner named Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.

Is it too little too late? \n       \n  Analysis by Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:32 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  King Charles’  decision  to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy as well as the  30-room mansion  where he’s lived for more than 20 years was as sudden as it was dramatic.\n \n\n   \n  It is the ultimate humiliation for the 65-year-old now-former prince,  known to enjoy the trappings and privilege of royal life. He will move out of Royal Lodge, his sprawling mansion in the heart of the Windsor estate just outside of London, and be exiled to the countryside to live in obscurity.\n \n\n   \n  The monarchy had been under intense pressure to resolve the Andrew issue amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which was further inflamed by the release of his sexual abuse accuser  Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.  Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks ago, Andrew  gave up the use  of his titles and honors, more than five years after  stepping back as a frontline royal . He said he was putting “duty to my family and country first,” but it did little to stop the snowballing scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Thursday evening, a brusque bombshell announcement from Buckingham Palace: Andrew is to lose his princely status, and effective immediately he is plain old Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, a commoner.\n \n\n   \n  The palace statement was clear – the decision was the king’s and Andrew had no choice in the matter (although he is understood not to have objected to his brother’s actions), Notable in the statement too, an expression of solidarity with victims of abuse.\n \n\n   \n  The significance of Charles’ moves on Thursday cannot be overstated. ﻿Not since the abdication crisis of 1936 has there been such a public casting aside of a senior British royal.\n \n\n   \n  The decision would doubtless have been difficult – and, given the personal family dynamics at play, deeply personal. But the monarch had no choice – Andrew’s controversies have been dogging the family for years and the publication of his accuser’s posthumous memoir was the final straw. The negotiations to get to this stage will have been challenging but the monarch had no option but to engage damage control mode.\n \n\n   \n  It was not just the public that had expressed outrage and frustration; there had also been increasing calls for Andrew to appear before a parliamentary committee. Perhaps this move will head off that particular indignity.\n \n\n   \n  Royal historian Kate Williams said the king’s decision was “unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a huge move from the royal family. Just recently, the King announced that Andrew was stepping back from the title Duke of York just a few days before Ms. Giuffre’s memoir was published. But that simply wasn’t enough for public opinion,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We have had people in the past losing the title of prince or princess. Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) said his daughters were no longer legitimate after he annulled the marriages with their mothers, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn – but he changed his mind later.”\n \n\n   \n  She also pointed out Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – whose title of the Duke of Albany was removed by parliament in 1917 after he fought for Germany in World War I. But Andrew’s situation, Williams said, was different as he was censured because of his serious errors of judgment.\n \n\n   \n  The king’s moves were welcomed by many British politicians. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that “the King has clearly felt that this is the right decision for the royal family” but added that it “must have been a very difficult thing” to act against his own sibling.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats said Andrew’s situation “had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”\n \n\n   \n  For several weeks, it has felt like some sort of announcement was coming down the pike and was simply a case of when, rather than if.\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources told CNN that the king was trying to act swiftly following recent developments but had needed some time to consult legal and constitutional experts.\n \n\n   \n  It is also understood that the king took action in light of his sibling’s serious lapses of judgment and has the support of the wider family, including Prince William.\n \n\n   \n  The statement, when it came, was uncompromising. “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  For many people in the country, and certainly critics of the royal family, these moves might not be enough to rehabilitate the monarchy’s tarnished reputation. For some, the removal of Andrew’s status as prince only goes so far. Other critics say the family has shielded Andrew over the years, and pressure for some sort of accountability needs to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite being stripped of his prince title, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. Royal sources have told CNN that he will be given a house on the king’s private estate in Sandringham, and will receive an income from Charles as well.\n \n\n   \n  His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has been living with Andrew at Royal Lodge for the last two decades, is moving out as well and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Their two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear if the king’s actions will be enough to give a public perception that the situation has been handled, but Charles seems to be doing as much as he feels he can within his own royal prerogative.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-closing-times-election-results","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-04:00","title":"When polls close in Tuesday’s elections and when to expect results","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Tuesday, October 31, 2025, the United States holds a pivotal set of elections marking the first major test of President Donald Trump’s second term.

\n       \n  Analysis by David Goldman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Fact 1:  America’s  economy  and  stock market  keep growing, buoyed by  robust consumer spending  and  AI mega-growth .\n \n\n   \n   Fact 2:  Hiring is at a  standstill ,  inflation  is rising,  loan defaults  are abundant and Americans give this economy a  near-record-low rating .\n \n\n   \n  Confused? To understand how both of those things can be true, consider the burrito.\n \n\n   \n  Chipotle on Wednesday reported miserable earnings and cut its sales-growth forecast for the third-straight quarter. The culprit: Young and lower-income consumers (Chipotle’s core customers) are cutting back on their spending, and they’re starting to skip the guac.\n \n\n   \n  Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright on the company’s earnings call: “We’re not losing them to the competition; we’re losing them to grocery and food at home. And so, that consumer is under pressure. It is one of our core consumer cohorts. And so, they feel the pinch and we feel the pullback from them as well.”\n \n\n   \n  Boatwright said the company’s customer surveys showed many believed Chipotle was no longer affordable. People in households that bring in less than $100,000 a year drive about 40% of Chipotle’s sales.\n \n\n   \n  Another problem: 25- to 34-year-olds, who make up 25% of Chipotle’s sales, “pulled back meaningfully.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a component of a more discerning consumer, and I think most of it – the majority of it – is this massive pullback,” Boatwright said. “That household under $100,000 a year is pulling back.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, some consumers are spending like they’re from a completely different universe.\n \n\n   \n  Crocs CEO Andrew Rees noted that bifurcation on a call with analysts Thursday: “There is a portion of our North American consumers that are highly affluent. They’re buying Crocs, they’re buying other high-end brands and they are in great financial shape,” Rees said. “But there is a large portion of consumers who are nervous, they are in less-good financial shape and are being super cautious about their spending and certainly spending closer to need.”\n \n\n   \n  Or take Coke (to wash down your burrito). Coca-Cola’s Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun on a call last week with analysts said Coke’s earnings were boosted by strong demand for the company’s premium brands: Topo Chico, Smartwater and Fairlife.\n \n\n   \n  But Braun highlighted a successful two-pronged corporate strategy, noting the tough environment for lower-income consumers hasn’t changed – despite the growth in its high-end brands. That’s why Coke is also cutting sizes (and prices) on the lower end to drive sales – to “really tackle not only affordability but premiumization as well,” Braun said.\n \n\n   \n  “When we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said. “The pressure on middle- and low-end income consumers is still there.”\n \n\n   \n    The ‘K-shaped’ economy\n \n\n   \n  Economists call that phenomenon a “ K-shaped ” economy: Wealthier people are spending like nothing’s wrong. Lower-income people are making significant changes to preserve their finances.\n \n\n   \n  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell  addressed that concept  Wednesday in a media briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “On the K-shaped economy … if you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big public consumer-facing companies, many, many of them are saying there is a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not all anecdotal: Last month, Moody’s Analytics reported that the country’s top earners  are accounting for a growing share of overall spending .\n \n\n   \n  What’s causing that divide?\n \n\n   \n  Wealthier Americans are generally invested in the surging stock market, which has gained 17% this year. They have more job security than lower-income workers. And they own homes, which  keep appreciating  in the tight-supply market.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, less-affluent Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and their wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. If they lose their jobs, the cruddy labor market is preventing them from finding a new one – the number of Americans on unemployment insurance for multiple weeks recently surged to a  four-year high . And rents, until recently, had jumped as demand for rentals explodes – because so few homes have been on the market.\n \n\n   \n    What happens next?\n \n\n   \n  A K-shaped economy can be difficult to repair. America’s economy has been increasingly bifurcated for quite some time – with the exception of a few years following the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  During those post-pandemic years, government support for workers gave lower-income Americans a leg up. For the first time in a generation, the wealth gap narrowed.  Wages outpaced inflation , especially for lower-income workers. Interest rates were low, and homeowners refinanced like crazy to lock in historically low mortgage costs.\n \n\n   \n  But it was short-lived. The sugar rush of government stimulus checks wore off, and the economy resumed its previous trajectory. Mortgage rates rose to multi-decade highs. And, concerning for people who are getting left behind, the US government began pushing safety-net programs in the opposite direction, reducing benefits and increasing hurdles to access support.\n \n\n   \n  Those actions could widen that “K” in the future. Wider than you have to open your mouth to eat a Chipotle burrito.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/government-shutdown-billions-federal-aid-dries-up","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"‘I feel guilty eating a meal’: Low-income families prepare to lose access to billions in federal aid","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown enters its first month, millions of low-income Americans across the country face severe financial hardship due to the suspension of key federal aid programs.

Low-income families prepare to lose access to billions in federal aid \n       \n  By Isabelle Khurshudyan, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Annemarie King is eating only once a day, and her husband, Randall, is picking up extra shifts at the drywall factory where he works. They are among the nearly 42 million Americans preparing for their food stamp benefits to run dry in November because of the ongoing  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The Kings, who live in Cincinnati and have eight young children, depend on the roughly $1,000 in food stamps that they receive at the start of every month to stock their refrigerator with fresh fruits, vegetables and meat.\n \n\n   \n  But since the US Department of Agriculture  announced in mid-October  that it doesn’t have the funding to provide next month’s benefits during the government shutdown, Annemarie, a stay-at-home mother, has been buying more canned and boxed items and preparing less for dinner.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also going without food herself. Her 11-year-old son has noticed, she said, but she tells him not to worry and that she ate while he was at school.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel guilty eating a meal,” Annemarie said. “I don’t want to take food away from them.”\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown nears the one-month mark, it’s not just furloughed federal workers feeling the financial strain. Low-income households across the country will lose access to  key social safety net programs  in the coming days as billions of dollars in federal funding dries up.\n \n\n   \n  Beginning November 1, more than 65,000 children and families could lose access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources, according to the National Head Start Association. For some parents, that means they might have to quit their jobs because they won’t have child care anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Others are worried they might not get heat subsidies from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program before the winter months. On top of that, roughly 24 million Americans who receive health insurance through the Affordable Care Act are preparing for what is likely to be a  significant increase  in premiums next year.\n \n\n   \n  In interviews with people in cities across the country, the early implications of the stop in federal funding for low-income families are starting to come into focus. Food banks and other charities are expecting higher demand, as millions face increasingly desperate situations without the programs they rely on.\n \n\n   \n  At the Kings’ household, the loss of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, means that instead of serving chicken, a fresh vegetable and either mashed potatoes or macaroni and cheese, Annemarie has been cooking chicken and canned green beans. Chilis, pastas and roasts are on the menu more often since they can last for a few days.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family is suffering because neither side will compromise,” Annemarie said of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.  “It’s no longer a Democrat thing, it’s no longer a Republican thing. It’s our lives.”\n \n\n   \n  The status of SNAP funding for November is currently uncertain, however. A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight between Democratic-led states and the Trump administration over its US Department of Agriculture’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to provide benefits next month.\n \n\n   \n  However the judge rules, millions of Americans will not receive their food stamp benefits on time. An estimated 4.4 million people will be affected on November 1 alone, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n   Food pantries  around the country are preparing for a surge in demand next week if people don’t receive their SNAP stipends. But food bank directors have warned that they can provide only a fraction of the meals that are supplied by federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  And for some households, the loss of more than one of these programs has a compounding effect.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, Ohio – about an hour outside Cincinnati – the closure of the local Head Start program means Lauren Lowe, 42, will likely have to quit her job as a restaurant server. She and her husband were able to both work full time while their 4-year-old son, Carter, attended Head Start on weekdays.\n \n\n   \n  He and 176 other kids got meals and health care there. And he loved his friends and teachers, Lowe said. Since she’s had to tell him that this will be his last week in the program, Carter is “broken-hearted right now. He’s crying every single morning because he wants to be in school with his friends,” Lowe said.\n \n\n   \n  Lowe is feeling uneasy, too. Quitting her job means less income for the household – in addition to missing their food stamp benefits. \n \n\n   \n  “It’s really scary because, how do we make ends meet?” Lowe said. “I either stay home and school my child or figure out how we’re going to pay the bills to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowe will also have to replace the two meals Carter was getting every day he was at Head Start.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday mornings, kids do come in hungrier than usual, so we know they’re really dependent on that breakfast, lunch and snack we give them,” said Julia Wise, the executive director of the Highland County Community Action Organization, which runs the Hillsboro Head Start program. \n \n\n   \n  Wise said 45 Head Start staff will be furloughed on Monday. Other Head Start programs — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit.\n \n\n   \n  In the Kansas City area, 17 programs with grants expiring on November 1 decided to take a “financial risk” by staying open, said Kasey Lawson, the Head Start director for the Mid-America Regional Council. The providers do not know if they will be reimbursed later when the new grant year is funded.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, teachers prepared homework packets that will take the kids through the end of November, so they can keep studying even when the program is closed. Some of that staff will likely   get other jobs before the government shutdown ends, meaning whenever Head Start does get funding again, it might not have enough educators to reopen all its classrooms, Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  For those who can’t find other work, “they’re going on furlough, they’re not going to have money coming in, so they could apply for SNAP benefits, but now SNAP is not going to be available either,” Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  “This is impacting us across the board,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  In rural Oregon, where the temperatures are already dipping below the freezing mark, the suspension of funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, is putting lives at risk, said Sheri Gutierrez, energy program manager at Community Action Program of East Central Oregon, a nonprofit that provides a range of services for residents in need.\n \n\n   \n  The $4 billion program, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start; the aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December.\n \n\n   \n  But barely a month into the season, Community Action in Oregon already has more than $200,000 in grant payments that are on hold until the government reopens. Many of its clients heat their homes with propane, wood and heating oil, and they don’t enjoy the same continuous service and shutoff protections available to many people who use electricity and natural gas to stay warm.\n \n\n   \n  The delay has worried local residents, some of whom are using old space heaters or their ovens, which Gutierrez says aren’t safe.\n \n\n   \n  “We hear the desperation when speaking to these clients on a daily basis. People want reassurance that they will get assistance,” she said. “LIHEAP is lifesaving. Without heat, they won’t survive.”\n \n\n   \n  In Lakeville, Minnesota, Ronda Beck is also waiting for help from LIHEAP to cover the electric bill. After speaking with her utility company “at great length,” Beck was told she could pay whatever she can until her grant is funded and she won’t be disconnected. But she’s not sure how she’ll scrape together a couple of bucks since she’s not working.\n \n\n   \n  “Where do I get $5 from?” She said. “It’s a tough situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Beck figured she could survive on groceries she picks up from her local food pantries if she and her adult son stop receiving food stamps next month – that is until she found out on Tuesday that one of the groups is only providing two or three days of food, instead two weeks’ worth. Now, she’s terrified.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to go hungry,” said Beck, who along with her son is looking for jobs in Lakeville, Minnesota, where they live. “I don’t want to walk into [a food pantry] and have them say, ‘We’re at our limit’.”\n \n\n   \n  Just outside Washington DC, Willissa Bullock worries about her food bank running out, as it’s dealing with a surge in demand from furloughed federal workers in the area. When the Landover, Maryland, resident heard that the USDA would not issue benefits next month, Bullock says she cried – nervous about how she would provide for her kids, who are in college.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Bullock left a local food pantry run by No Limits Outreach Ministries with only enough items – including lettuce, apple juice, and canned goods – to last two or three days. Until recently, her shopping cart would be overflowing.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m telling the kids to look for jobs,” said Bullock, who is unemployed and applying for disability after having back surgery. “It’s the only way we’ll be able to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  The food pantry has been receiving fewer shipments from Capital Area Food Bank after two  Covid 19-era relief programs  were canceled earlier this year. The pantry used to be able to offer meat, fish, eggs and milk to its clients, but now it mostly has beans, rice and canned foods, said Oliver Carter, pastor of No Limits Outreach Ministries.\n \n\n   \n  “Our storage used to be full and now it’s almost empty,” Carter said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/polls-election-major-races","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"What the Polls Say About the Key Races in the 2025 Off-Year Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Polling data from key off-year elections in 2025 highlights strong Democratic advantages in Virginia and New Jersey, driven by public dissatisfaction with national Republican leadership, particularly Donald Trump.

EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  We’re just days away from 2025’s off-year elections. Beyond how the races themselves turn out, the contests will be a valuable source of data to analyze – and perhaps overanalyze – ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s an overview of what the polls suggest about the four big races we’re watching this year.\n \n\n   \n  A note: Polls are a valuable tool for understanding the electorate, but they’re most useful when they’re treated as estimates rather than attempts to predict the future with pinpoint precision. Often, what they tell us about the broader political environment is more valuable than the exact margin that any specific survey finds for a race.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia statewide races\n \n\n   \n   Virginia’s election for governor  takes place in the shadow of an unpopular GOP administration in Washington, DC.  A Washington Post-Schar School poll  asked voters to describe the most important issue in the race. The share who responded with negative comments about President Donald Trump or Republicans came second only to concerns about economic issues and the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  The Post-Schar poll, which found Democrat Abigail Spanberger with a 12-point lead over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears among likely voters, joins  other recent   surveys  in the state that show Spanberger with a stable advantage in the race. There’s much more uncertainty in the other statewide races, particularly the campaign for attorney general, where polls show support for Democrat Jay Jones facing some erosion after  the publication of text messages  in which he fantasized about killing a legislative colleague.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey’s gubernatorial race  is a tale of two incumbents: Trump is unpopular there as well, but the state’s outgoing Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, also draws closely divided ratings for his time in office. Many recent surveys of the race, including polls from  Quinnipiac University ,  F ox News,   Fairleigh Dickinson University  and the  Rutgers-Eagleton Poll , have found Democrat Mikie Sherrill with an edge among likely voters, hovering around the 50% mark, while her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, stands closer to 45%.\n \n\n   \n  Quinnipiac’s latest poll, like several others, found that Ciattarelli’s supporters were more likely than Sherrill’s to express strong enthusiasm about their chosen candidate, although Sherrill’s favorability ratings remained higher overall.\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n   New York City’s multi-candidate mayoral race  poses a unique challenge for pollsters. Surveys of likely voters, however, have been largely consistent in showing Democrat Zohran Mamdani with a double-digit lead over his nearest rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with Republican Curtis Sliwa in third. They differ on the precise scope of Mamdani’s advantage, although most have found him shy of clearing a majority of support in the race.\n \n\n   \n  In polls released Thursday by  Marist College  and  Fox News , Mamdani was buoyed by positive favorability ratings and broad support among younger voters, while older voters broke for Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n    California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps nowhere is the role of national politics as clear as in California, where  voters are weighing Proposition 50 , a ballot measure to temporarily enact a new congressional map drawn by Democrats in response to Republican-driven redistricting in other states.\n \n\n   \n  A mid-October poll from  CBS/YouGov  found 62% of likely voters in support of Proposition 50, while  an October Public Policy Institute of California poll  put that support at 56%. It’s worth noting that  past research has found  that polling sometimes overshoots support for initiatives that implement new changes – whether liberal or conservative – because some voters default to preferring the status quo.\n \n\n   \n  Half of likely voters said in the CBS/YouGov poll that their decision had more to do with national issues and politics than with state or local issues. Broad majorities of likely voters supporting Proposition 50 said their choice was driven by the desire to oppose Trump, to oppose national Republicans and to support national Democrats.\n \n\n   \n    A note on the state of polling\n \n\n   \n  How have polls been performing lately? A  new postmortem report on 2024 election polling , released Wednesday by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, found that polling in last year’s election was significantly more accurate than it was in 2020 or 2016 even as it continued to underestimate Republican vote shares for the third straight presidential cycle. (Polls in the 2022 and 2018 midterms both saw smaller directional errors.)\n \n\n   \n  As the report also noted, polls last year weren’t always able to estimate the ways that turnout changed between 2020 and 2024. That bears mentioning because all of these surveys reflect pollsters’ best estimations about who’s likely to end up voting in an off-year election – and how much that might differ from four years ago, at the start of former President Joe Biden’s administration.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/economy/us-government-shutdown-economy-snowball","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"As the shutdown drags on, here’s how it can drag down the economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The federal government shutdown, now the longest on record and lasting into October 2025, is creating significant economic risks.

      5:30 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  federal government shutdown  has lasted all month and is on pace to become the longest on record.\n \n\n   \n  While history has shown that the economy typically rebounds from a shutdown within a couple of months, each day it drags on brings   a greater risk that the economy  won’t just bend, but will start to break — and rupture livelihoods in the process, economists say.\n \n\n   \n  “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  The negative effects start to build on themselves very rapidly and the collateral damage becomes more widespread, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering momentum and mass,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Predicting something that has becoming increasingly unpredictable is an impossible task, but here’s a look at how the shutdown could ripple through critical avenues of everyday life.\n \n\n   \n    Jobs\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the shutdown, the US job market  was already on its back .\n \n\n   \n  It’s been a  low-hire, low-fire, low-churn environment . Employers, frozen by high economic and policy uncertainty, have held off making investments and adding workers. Some businesses have used this period to test the waters on  artificial intelligence  and other technologies – in turn putting to the test that “low-fire” descriptor by announcing mass layoffs in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,” Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  Considering that backdrop, the tepid job gains can potentially turn into deeper job losses if safety nets become frayed, more paychecks are missed by federal workers and contractors, and spending pullbacks reverberate through the private sector, causing businesses to lay off workers or shut down, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rate cuts and some greater clarity around trade deals and tariffs were supposed to fuel a rebound in hiring heading into 2026, noted Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at employment site ZipRecruiter.\n \n\n   \n  “However, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year’s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,” she wrote in a note earlier this month. “This would delay hiring plans that might otherwise materialize, keeping the labor market stuck in place.”\n \n\n   \n  US consumer confidence during October dipped to its lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump announced a massive suite of steep tariffs on imported goods, according to The Conference Board’s latest index released this week.\n \n\n   \n    Health care and the care economy\n \n\n   \n  The expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage is at the  crux of the Congressional stalemate  to fund the federal government and end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, while  Republicans say they won’t negotiate  until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Open enrollment starts on November 1, and the more than 22 million Americans who use the federal health insurance marketplace are  expected to see their monthly premium leap  by 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis.\n \n\n   \n  Also on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico are at risk of  losing access to Head Start programs , which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households.\n \n\n   \n  Any center closures could quickly increase financial hardship for lower-earnings families. Child care disruptions have been shown to  negatively impact labor force participation  (particularly  for women ), productivity growth and overall economic growth.\n \n\n   \n    Spending\n \n\n   \n  The lengthier the shutdown, the higher the probability for a greater drag on overall economic activity, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.\n \n\n   \n  “And this isn’t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you’re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn’t happen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  There’s the job that doesn’t get filled, the trip that doesn’t get taken and the holiday spending that doesn’t occur.\n \n\n   \n  “At some point, things start to break because they’re just not getting done,” added Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics. “When this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence – consumer, business, investor confidence – the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.”\n \n\n   \n  If the shutdown continues past Thanksgiving, “there’s no coming back from that quickly,” he said, adding that will cause “damage that’s longer-lasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. It has remained  largely resilient , despite massive uncertainty and persistently high inflation.\n \n\n   \n  However, it’s likely done so because of an increasingly bifurcated, or  “K-shaped” economy . Wealthy consumers, buoyed in part by strong market gains, are driving more of the spending while lower- and middle-income households are facing increased strain.\n \n\n   \n    Prices and interest rates\n \n\n   \n  A drawn-out shutdown could inject further “crosscurrents” into an already  choppy price environment , Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  On one hand, disruptions to government services and funding could affect trade and supply chains, driving up prices. On the other hand, a weakened economy would mean it’s harder for companies to raise prices, which could help keep overall inflation in check.\n \n\n   \n  “The net of all that, I think, is hard to know,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the shutdown and its economic fallout could give the Federal Reserve one more reason to  continue cutting interest rates , he added.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fed’s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions,” he said. “This [shutdown] would weaken the already fragile job market more.”\n \n\n   \n    The human impact\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown could very well exacerbate those struggles for many Americans, especially people on the margins.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans are “not taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they’re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment,” Zandi said. “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think so.”\n \n\n   \n  A lack of funding for safety net programs,  particularly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , could not only exacerbate hunger and hardship for tens of millions of Americans, but also threatens to destabilize local economies, especially in rural areas.\n \n\n   \n  “It just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,” KPMG economist Swonk said. “Low- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard when you see the struggles we’re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,” she added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-senate-filibuster-nuclear-option-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00.000Z","title":"Trump calls for end of Senate filibuster to break funding stalemate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has urged Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Senate filibuster as a decisive step to end a prolonged government shutdown that has lasted over 35 days and threatens critical services like food aid and air traffic operations.

And it immediately ratcheted up the pressure on Republican leaders, who have adamantly opposed eliminating the  60-vote threshold for passing legislation  as a way to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Top GOP lawmakers have long argued for keeping that threshold in place, asserting that the filibuster benefits Republicans — and will serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump on Thursday appeared to abruptly change course, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the  longest-ever government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n   Critical food aid  for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend. The White House on Thursday also sought to highlight the stress that the shutdown is putting on air traffic controllers by convening a roundtable of airline industry representatives and union leaders.\n \n\n   \n   This story  has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/prince-andrew-title-and-honors-remove-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:23:00-04:30","title":"King Charles strips his brother Andrew of ‘prince’ title and evicts him from royal mansion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles has taken the unprecedented step of stripping Prince Andrew of his royal titles—such as Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, and Baron Killyleagh—and evicting him from Royal Lodge in Windsor, citing 'serious lapses of judgment' tied to his alleged association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

of ‘prince’ title and evicts him from royal mansion \n       \n  By Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:23 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s King Charles took  the extraordinary step  of starting the process to strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles and evict him from the royal estate in Windsor, in the most dramatic attempt yet to quell the scandal over the disgraced prince’s links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The move, described in stark terms by Buckingham Palace as “necessary censures,” cements the deepest split in the British royal family in decades. The question now: whether King Charles and the British establishment have done enough to prevent Andrew’s association with  Epstein  from engulfing the monarchy.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre – who the prince claims never to have met – died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in a statement on Thursday: “Today, an ordinary American girl, from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.”\n \n\n   \n  Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that it had been a “joyous and happy and sad day.”\n \n\n   \n  In the statement, Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew would be forced out of his residence and take the family name. “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His  lease on Royal Lodge  has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, about 100 miles north of London, which is privately owned by the British monarch. Royal Lodge sits within Windsor Great Park, part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state. Andrew’s new accommodation will be privately funded by King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  It’s understood the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had sought to end the renewed scrutiny of his conduct by relinquishing  use of his titles  earlier this month. But his moves did little to stem the flow of negative headlines and sparked fresh questions about how he was able to pay Giuffre a reportedly multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil case in 2022 and fund his lifestyle despite having not been a working royal since 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Public anger has also grown after it emerged last week that he paid $1 million for Royal Lodge, in the heart of Windsor Great Park near Windsor Castle, in 2003, and only a peppercorn rent “if demanded” each year since then, according to his lease agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Thursday’s announcement, Andrew remains eighth in line to the British throne. That status  could be removed  by legislation, but it would require the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world, which would take time. The last time this protocol was used was when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that rather than formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York via an act of parliament, King Charles will send royal warrants to remove Andrew’s peerages.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The stripping of his titles takes immediate effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  In his interview with CNN, Sky Roberts said King Charles’ decision vindicated the years of campaigning by his sister. “She should be here. She should be having this interview with you,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had been fighting for this for a long time. She always said… only one of us is telling the truth and I know that’s me,” Roberts said. “We’re really proud of her. We’re so proud of what she was able to achieve.”\n \n\n   \n  Calling it a “huge moment” for his sister and other survivors, Roberts said: “It’s an acknowledgement to say, we believe you. We see you. And for me, I love you. We love you… This is a very vindicating moment for us. And I just wish she was here to to share this with us.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in their statement they would fight to ensure other associates of Epstein would face similar judgement. “Our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory,” the statement said, adding they will “not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”\n \n\n   \n    Calls for Andrew to face justice continue\n \n\n   \n  The anti-monarchy group Republic said Thursday that it had instructed lawyers to launch a private prosecution against Andrew “over accusations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.”\n \n\n   \n  The group said its lawyers would be actively investigating the case against Andrew and aim to begin proceedings in the coming weeks. Republic has previously called for the police to investigate Andrew.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be very clear, Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatton Windsor – is not facing justice. He’s not being held to account. Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said Thursday following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the British monarch was  heckled by a protester  who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.\n \n\n   \n    Andrew’s daughters to retain princess titles\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign – in line with rules set out by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lived with him for the past 20 years at Royal Lodge, will also move out and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Ferguson, 66, is the mother of Andrew’s two children. They wed in 1986 and divorced a decade later. She previously held the title of Duchess of York, but reverted to her maiden name when Andrew relinquished his titles earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also understands that the British government was consulted on the King’s decisions, and the government has made it clear that it supports the moves.\n \n\n   \n  The last time a prince had his title removed is understood to be more than 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. The action was taken after he fought in World War I for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s MiSeon Lee contributed to this report.

current CBA was set to expire on Friday and tensions have been rising in recent weeks as the sides try to work toward a new deal.\n \n\n   \n  The new Nov. 30 deadline gives the sides more time to come up with a new deal that would be transformational for the players in terms of salary. In 2019, when the last CBA deal had expired, the sides agreed to a 60-day extension and eventually ratified the current CBA in January 2020.\n \n\n   \n  The Athletic was the first to report the extension.\n \n\n   \n  The sides have had meetings over the past few days, including in New York on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Had an extension not been reached by Friday, the sides would have had three options: let things continue as is, have the players go on strike or the owners lock them out. A strike or lockout didn’t really make sense for either side to do.\n \n\n   \n  Players have already been paid for the past season and they have health insurance through April 30, 2026. There are no major events for the league on the immediate horizon until an expansion draft for new teams Portland and Toronto. The expansion draft for Golden State took place last December.\n \n\n   \n  The players exercised their right to opt out of the current CBA last year with hopes of getting, among other things, increased revenue sharing, higher salaries, improved benefits and a softer salary cap.\n \n\n   \n  The WNBA’s offers to this point have clearly not been to the players’ liking, although it is unclear how far apart the sides are in terms of salary parameters. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said during the WNBA Finals that the league — like the players — wants a “transformative deal” done with significant increases to salary and benefits.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/oakland-california-museum-theft","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00-04:00","title":"Over 1,000 Items Stolen from California Museum’s Collection in Early Morning Heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant cultural heist, over 1,000 items from the Oakland Museum of California's collection were stolen in the early hours of October 15, 2025, at an off-site storage facility.

early morning heist \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:45 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Police in California are investigating the theft of more than 1,000 items from a museum’s collection including metalwork jewelry, Native American baskets and everyday items like athletic trophies that tell the story of the Golden State.\n \n\n   \n  The burglary occurred in the early morning hours of Oct. 15 at an off-site storage facility of the Oakland Museum of California, Oakland Police said in a news release Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Lori Fogarty, the museum’s director, said Thursday the investigation was going public because the artifacts might show up at flea markets, antique stores or pawn shops.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not just a loss to the museum,” she said. “They’re a loss to the public, to our community and we’re hoping our community can help us bring them home.”\n \n\n   \n  Fogarty said it appeared to be a crime of opportunity, and not a targeted art theft.\n \n\n   \n  “We think the thieves found a way to enter the building, and they grabbed what they could easily find and snatch and get out of the building with,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Stolen items include neckpieces by the late artist and metalsmith Florence Resnikoff, a pair of scrimshaw walrus tusks and Native American baskets. But she said much of it was historical memorabilia from the 20th century such as campaign pins and athletic awards.\n \n\n   \n  The mission of the Oakland Museum of California is to document the art, history and natural environment of California, and its collection includes works by California artists from the late 18th century to the present, a well as artifacts, photographs, natural specimens and sound recordings. The museum has mounted shows dedicated to the Black Power movement and student activism.\n \n\n   \n  John Romero, a retired Los Angeles Police Department captain who led the department’s commercial crimes unit, told the  Los Angeles Times  that the items may already have been sold since the burglary occurred two weeks ago. He expects detectives are looking at resale platforms such as Craigslist and Ebay, and networks that specialize in historic or collectible antiques.\n \n\n   \n  “These people are interested in fast cash, not the full appraisal value,” he told the Times. “They need to get rid of it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  In January 2013, an Oakland man broke into the museum itself and got away with a California Gold Rush-era jewelry box. Fogarty said the the item was traced to a pawn shop with help from the public, and she hopes the community can help again.\n \n\n   \n  The Oakland Police Department declined to provide further details, but said in its news release that police are working with a unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that specializes in art crime, including theft, forgery or antiquities and cultural property trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  The theft occurred four days before thieves made off with  priceless Napoleonic jewels  from the world’s most-visited museum, the Louvre, in broad daylight. Authorities have  made arrests  but the jewels have not been recovered.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/fbi-fires-agent-trump-investigations","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00.000Z","title":"FBI fires special agent who helped oversee Trump investigation, sources say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI has fired special agent Aaron Tapp, who played a key role in overseeing investigations into former President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, including the 'Arctic Frost' probe into fake electors.

And the government is more shut than ever.\n \n\n   \n  Washington woke Thursday to a whiff of rare hope that  behind-the-scenes efforts  were accelerating in the Senate to end a federal shutdown now imposing severe pain on millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  But the day ended with senators skipping town for the weekend — to join members of the House not seen inside the Beltway for so long it’s hard to remember what they look like.\n \n\n   \n  What’s so galling is that both Republicans and Democrats insist they are keeping faith with their duties — taking care of the American people — but that the other side is willing to drive ordinary citizens to the brink of hunger or sickness.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown, refusing to extend federal funding until Republicans agree to extend expiring  enhanced Obamacare subsidies , without which millions of citizens will see  the cost of health care rocket .\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are willing to talk — but only when the government is opened again. Their assurances aren’t being taken at face value since their president routinely ignores the terms of deals and Congress’ constitutionally sound decisions on how to spend taxpayer money.\n \n\n   \n  The result:  Vital SNAP benefits  that help feed more than 40 million people are within hours of running out. Federal workers deemed essential have slogged through demoralizing weeks without pay. And it’s no vacation for their furloughed colleagues either: Financial obligations aren’t shut down just because the government is.\n \n\n   \n  Little is evident on the horizon that could prevent the monthlong shutdown from becoming the longest on record next week.\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of meaningful progress, dismayed lawmakers spent the day venting and trading insults.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accused Republicans of starving kids. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of putting extreme pressure  on air traffic controllers , implying they were risking the nation’s “extra safe” skies. And President Donald Trump — perhaps the sole agent with the capacity to change the political wind and end the shutdown — didn’t really say anything until a late-night post calling on GOP senators to  abolish the filibuster  to end the funding stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  West Virginia Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said staying in town over the weekend “is gonna be a waste of time.” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, told CNN’s Dana Bash he was shocked “at the level of cruelty” shown by his GOP colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  And renegade Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has had it up to here with everyone. “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month,”  Fetterman told CNN . He also complained about his own party’s tactics. “We can’t even get our sh*t together and just open up our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    One judge says she won’t let people die\n \n\n   \n  Democrats might have some justification in arguing that Republicans and their health care policies and endless attempts to kill Obamacare set the stage for this crisis. But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.\n \n\n   \n  But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government. And any victory for either party at this point will be hollow, since it will be built on the suffering of citizens.\n \n\n   \n  One federal judge in Boston is doing what the judiciary often seems to do these days: stepping in where Congress has failed.  US District Judge Indira Talwani  signaled she will intervene in the dispute over the Trump administration’s refusal to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to fund food stamps under SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” Talwani said in the kind of plain English that lawmakers seem to shed when they get to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, Talwani said. “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger.\n \n\n   \n    Is there any hope for a breakthrough?\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes in Washington, the darkest hour is the one before dawn. So maybe there’s a chance the vicious rhetoric is a smokescreen allowing everyone to vent before they compromise.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s another characteristic of modern Washington that may be more apt right now — the way that disaster always has to nearly strike before two parties mired in their ideological extremes find a sliver of common ground.\n \n\n   \n  But at some point, this shutdown will end. It has to.\n \n\n   \n  If the denouement does not come from a president who discovers a moral or political imperative to live up to his 2016 convention vow, “I alone can fix it,” it may emerge from a creative fudge in the Senate in which Republicans give a handful of Democratic senators political cover to vote to break the filibuster and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Majority Leader John Thune — who ditched his suave self-control on Wednesday to rage at Democrats in a Senate rant — struck one hopeful note when he said there was an uptick in bipartisan conversations this week. “We got members on both sides who are continuing to dialogue,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune doesn’t yet have the political space to offer Democrats the kind of tangible deliverables they would need. “When they’re willing to produce the votes to open up the government, we’re going to talk,” he said, restating the sticking point.\n \n\n   \n  One possible endgame scenario is that the Senate could blur the sequencing of when the government reopens and talks get serious on Obamacare subsidies. But knowing how something might eventually end is easier than getting there.\n \n\n   \n  Therefore, in the absence of progress, everyone had to fill the space.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now beginning Day 30 of the Democrat shutdown,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana. “There are millions of Americans … that are bracing themselves for further pain and hardship.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York accused the administration of enacting “policy violence” by refusing to extend Obamacare subsidies while offering a  $20 billion bailout  to Trump’s MAGA pal President Javier Milei in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said he wasn’t worried about his own air travel as air traffic control snarls, but did “worry about the flights of thousands and thousands of people.” Mixing transportation metaphors, he accused Democrats of being “way off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n  And Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York followed his warning on Wednesday that Trump “is a vindictive politician and a heartless politician and a heartless man” by accusing Republicans of bringing down “the specter of financial disaster” on Americans — including in red states — over health care.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not exactly promising.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune told reporters, “I’m always optimistic. Aren’t you?”\n \n\n   \n  That’s a tough one, senator.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"03:09:00-20:00","title":"Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in over 150 years, caused catastrophic damage across the Caribbean, with Jamaica suffering the worst impacts due to a Category 5 landfall, resulting in widespread destruction, power outages, and at least 49 confirmed deaths.

October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after  Hurricane Melissa  tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds have  already unleashed  widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa lashed Bermuda as a Category 1 storm overnight Thursday into Friday as the storm passed the islands, bringing quick-hitting bursts of strong wind and rain. The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical as it races south of Newfoundland into cooler Atlantic water.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the storm, authorities in Bermuda closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands across the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  At least 49 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.\n \n\n   \n  The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.\n \n\n   \n    Jamaica hardest hit\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica took the  heaviest battering . Melissa made landfall there as a  Category 5 storm , with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).\n \n\n   \n  “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit coastal town of Black River on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  People gathering around the Black River Bridge searched for water, food and news about their loved ones. The Jamaican Defense Forces have landed in the area by helicopter, but desperation is setting in for residents, Van Dam reported. Many are trying to leave the area with their personal items by car, motorbike or on foot.\n \n\n   \n  Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15 feet of storm surge from Hurricane Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.\n \n\n   \n  The heat and humidity are complicating recovery efforts. There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”\n \n\n   \n  “What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17 th  century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.\n \n\n   \n  But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.\n \n\n   \n  In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, education minister Dana Morris Dixon said in a Tuesday  statement .\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, more than 13,000 residents were still in shelters, while 72% of the island was without power,  Jamaican government officials  said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, minister for local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel pushing more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Schools around the capital Kingston on the eastern side of the island are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba\n \n\n   \n  Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday. The country sustained “extensive damage,” according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n \n\n   \n  This included flooding, mudslides, property destruction and infrastructure damage, particularly in Cuba’s eastern regions, where hundreds of rural communities were left isolated.\n \n\n   \n  As many as 140,000 people were cut off due to rising rivers as the storm passed, according to  the Red Cross . In the province of Santiago, at least 241 communities were cut off due to the storm, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were evacuated in Cuba as Melissa approached.\n \n\n   \n  Cuba’s foreign ministry said it is in touch with the US State Department to get clarity on how the United States would be willing to help with recovery.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio  announced  earlier Thursday that the US is “prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance” to the Cuban people – both directly and through local partners.\n \n\n   \n  The administration of President Donald Trump has historically taken a hard-line stance against the communist-ruled island. In June, the president signed a  memorandum  that the White House said would increase pressure on the Cuban government and support the long-running US economic embargo of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio said Thursday that US law includes exemptions that authorize private donations of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to Cuba, as well as disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío responded to the offer by  saying : “We have been in contact with the State Department and are awaiting clarification on how and in what way they are willing to assist.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuba is already receiving some aid from partners such as China and Venezuela, as well as the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n    High death toll in Haiti\n \n\n   \n  The highest death toll so far has been reported in Haiti, where the hurricane did not make direct landfall but caused significant damage and at least 30 deaths, Reuters said. Twenty of these fatalities, including 10 children, were due to flooding in Petit-Goâve, where a flooded river burst its banks.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    International efforts\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding. The British government also said it was chartering a limited number of flights to help British nationals leave Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  on Tuesday showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/middleeast/israel-receives-remains-hostages-gaza-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"13:02:00Z","title":"Israel receives remains of two deceased hostages held in Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel received the remains of two deceased hostages, Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, transferred via the Red Cross from Gaza, marking a significant step in the ongoing hostage recovery under the US-brokered ceasefire.

\nUpdated: \n        1:02 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israel received the remains two deceased hostages held in Gaza on Thursday afternoon. The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and taken to the country’s national forensics laboratory for identification.\n \n\n   \n  The deceased hostages were identified as Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  Cooper, 84, was one of the founder of Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza. He was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His family was notified in June 2024 that he was killed in captivity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said he was was killed in captivity around February of last year.\n \n\n   \n  Cooper was the last remaining hostage from Nir Oz, one of the communities hardest hit during the initial attack two years ago, whose body had not been returned. “We will always remember Amiram as a man of people and of words, a pioneer with values, a person of initiative and ideas who so deeply loved the kibbutz and its members,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Baruch, 25, was also taken hostage during the October 7 attack from his mother’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri. Baruch’s brother and grandmother were killed in the attack. Two months later, Baruch was killed in Gaza during a failed rescue attempt. “In this difficult and painful moment, we hope the family can find a measure of comfort in the closing of a horrific circle of 755 days and nights,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s transfer leaves the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross.

expensive rents. Some live in ‘haunted’ houses to cut a deal \n       \n  By Chris Lau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In land-starved Hong Kong a tiny, no-frills apartment far from the city center can eat up half of a monthly salary. But for bold renters there’s one sure way to get a discount: choose a property haunted by a murder or unnatural death.\n \n\n   \n  The houses, often apartments inside the city’s tall residential buildings, strike so much fear among residents that anyone willing to live there can negotiate hefty discounts in one of the world’s most expensive property markets.\n \n\n   \n  “The discount could be massive and many people who don’t mind can rent these places below the market price” said Ng Goon-lau, an investor so well-known for owning dozens of these apartments that local media has dubbed him the “King of Haunted Houses.”\n \n\n   \n  Lists of haunted houses can be found on most estate agent websites. They are places where an unnatural or premature death has occurred and include the scenes of some of the city’s most gruesome murders.\n \n\n   \n  Property-listing website Spacious.hk compiles a 92-page list that dates back to 2006, featuring details of how each death occurred. In a city known for its tightly packed residential towers, many entries state the cause of death as “fell from height.”\n \n\n   \n  Other real estate agencies  offer advice  about how to identify spooky apartments, including checking death certificates and quizzing potential neighbors about the apartment’s history.\n \n\n   \n  In a city heavily influenced by Buddhism and Taoism, living in apartments associated with ghastly deaths often stokes fear of bad fortune.\n \n\n   \n  Feng shui master Andrew Kwan said people believe that those who died a tragic death may not get closure. “Their hatred may stay. (Their spirit) may remain in the apartment,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The fear of a curse has created a unique market for bargain-hunting investors and tenants who are happy to try their luck.\n \n\n   \n  Property prices plunge by an average of 20% after they are labelled haunted – and up to 34% in the event of a murder, according to Utpal Bhattacharya, Chair Professor of Finance at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, who led a study on the phenomena in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  A ripple effect spreads to properties on the same floor, which often see their value drop 10%, and even flats in the same building can fall 7%, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The belief in Feng Shui is quite strong among Chinese, and the population in Hong Kong is about 94% Chinese…implying that most buyers have a large distaste for haunted houses,” said Bhattacharya.\n \n\n   \n  Disclosure is not required under Hong Kong law, but regulators demand property agents provide accurate information about any death upon inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  These details matter because the circumstance of the death – from accidents to malicious murders – could determine the size of the discount.\n \n\n   \n    Turning bad fortune into dollars\n \n\n   \n  In death, Ng, a veteran investor in his 70s, sees opportunity. He scoops up the so-called haunted homes from owners who are desperate to sell, and leases them out at up to 30% below market price.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people don’t actually have a strong feeling against hung zaats. It all comes down to the extent of the discount,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the prevailing mood of the city is to stay away – or at least be cautious.\n \n\n   \n  That especially applies to properties linked to some of the city’s most chilling murder cases.\n \n\n   \n  In 2014, British banker Rurik Jutting  brutally murdered two Indonesian women  and hid one of the bodies in a suitcase in his upscale apartment in J Residence in Wan Chai, a popular nightlife district in Hong Kong.\n \n\n   \n  As gruesome details of the murders emerged, the value of the one-bedroom apartment where they took place was estimated to have plunged from $1.16 million to $770,000, with its $3,740 monthly rental halved, Bloomberg reported at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Another unit in Tsuen Wan, a residential neighborhood in the New Territories, was sold at a loss of $142,000, shaving 40% off the original price, according to local news reports. The unit was the scene of a money-fueled murder in 2016 involving three men, who killed their friend and sealed his body in a slab of cement stored in the unit.\n \n\n   \n  Owners of the properties are almost certain to lose money. It’s very difficult to find a buyer for homes listed as a haunted house – partly because banks also tend to stay away.\n \n\n   \n  Eric Pau, Senior Associate Director at Ricacorp Properties, a major real estate firm in Hong Kong, told CNN many banks view them as high-risk investments. “In most cases, mortgages will not be granted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But he said others see it as an opportunity. As an investor, Ng’s playbook is to be selective about the type of “haunted homes” he buys.\n \n\n   \n  He tries to avoid properties associated with gruesome murders as much as possible and looks for places where the death occurred some time ago.\n \n\n   \n  “Fortunately, some ‘haunted houses’ have been around for so long that people have forgotten about what happened,” he said. “The main thing is to make people not to feel sad and unpleasant.”\n \n\n   \n  But like all investments, there are risks, and Ng has had some spooky failures.\n \n\n   \n  One time, he said, a tenant broke the lease just days after moving in. The tenant never told him why, so he turned to the neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  “The neighbors told me that the three-year-old son of this tenant opened a very difficult book in the middle of the night and read it attentively,” Ng recalled being told.\n \n\n   \n  “He thought his son was possessed,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/uk/salem-britain-witches-pardon-campaign-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00Z","title":"Salem’s witches were pardoned, but Britain’s weren’t.

Thirty-two people faced charges ranging from theft and murder to witchcraft, Claire Kehily, councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. Six women, accused of bewitching to death a 10-day-old infant, her mother, and a 3-year-old child, became the focus of the town’s attention, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In the summer of 1652, the town was “abuzz with excitement,” Kehily explained.  “People came down from London to witness what was going on. It was the biggest thing we’d had here for a long time.”\n \n\n   \n  The accused were held in a small, dark jail that once stood on the ground floor of the courthouse, now tucked away in the attic of the rebuilt Town Hall.\n \n\n   \n  The trial’s notoriety was such that a special pamphlet was published shortly after, titled “A Prodigious and Tragic History of the Arraignment, Trial, Confession, and Condemnation of Six Witches,” of which Maidstone Council has a rare replica.\n \n\n   \n  The document describes bizarre and unverified claims – including one woman swelling “into a monstrous and vast bigness” before the court and another allegedly bearing “a visible teat under her tongue.”\n \n\n   \n  Three women were convicted after failing a crude test: a pin thrust into their arms. The court account said the women “did not feel it, neither did it draw blood.”\n \n\n   \n  Two others confessed to being impregnated “not by any man, but by the devil,” according to the document.\n \n\n   \n  All six were convicted of “the execrable and diabolical crime of witchcraft” and sentenced to death.\n \n\n   \n    Spectacle of execution\n \n\n   \n  Their execution took place at Penenden Heath, now a tranquil park with soccer fields and woodland.\n \n\n   \n  “They were dragged on hurdles – basically carts – to the heath,” Tony Harwood, a councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. “Thousands came to watch. Public executions were entertainment, but also a tool of control.”\n \n\n   \n  “These were women of all ages,” Harwood continued. “Very vulnerable individuals who had no idea what was going on or why they had been put into this situation. You just have to understand the absolute terror of these events – and that is partly what’s behind it. The powers that be wanted to instil terror.”\n \n\n   \n  Harwood described the horror and spectacle of the scene. “Public executions – they were public participation events. Thousands of people would attend. There were crime waves around them: pickpocketing, thefts, lots of complaints. That’s why the execution spot at Penenden Heath was moved several times – because of the impact from the many thousands of sightseers who came to watch,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “There would have been people who were just there for the show. There would have been people who were appalled by what was going on. There would have been people who were excited by it.”\n \n\n   \n  After the executions, the bodies were discarded without ceremony. “When roads were widened or housing built, human remains have often been found,” Harwood added.\n \n\n   \n  A small stone plaque on the edge of Penenden Heath that commemorates these women – alongside the plaques for the many other people executed at this site – is the only mark of the atrocities that took place.\n \n\n   \n    Seeking justice, centuries later\n \n\n   \n  Though the frenzy surrounding witchcraft in England faded in the decades following the Maidstone trial, and all laws criminalizing witchcraft have long since been repealed, the convictions of those women – and hundreds like them – still stand.\n \n\n   \n  Now, nearly 400 years later, Maidstone Borough Council is calling for change.\n \n\n   \n  Stuart Jeffery, leader of the council, has written to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, urging the British government to introduce legislation that would grant a general pardon to those executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1562, including the women hanged at Penenden Heath in 1652.\n \n\n   \n  “Justice is timeless,” said Harwood. “These terrible wrongs carried out between 1542 and the mid-18th century echo through the ages. They cannot just be painted over.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to set the record straight. These were innocent, vulnerable individuals who were brutally judicially murdered – often for political or personal gain. That injustice will echo down the ages.”\n \n\n   \n  Kehily said that the trials were “a very early form of violence against women and girls. It still happens. They were scapegoats.”\n \n\n   \n  “By highlighting it, we remind people that this has happened – and we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “To address a wrong that has been made,” Kehily said, “is to try and get it right, to learn from history, and to bring it to the fore. This hasn’t gone away.”\n \n\n   \n    Precedents for pardon\n \n\n   \n  Maidstone’s campaign follows similar efforts elsewhere in the United Kingdom to confront historical injustices.\n \n\n   \n  In Scotland, then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a formal apology in 2022 to the thousands of people – mostly women – who were accused and executed under the country’s Witchcraft Act between the 16th and 18th centuries. The apology came after a sustained campaign by historians and activists who argued that the victims were persecuted for being poor, vulnerable, or simply different.\n \n\n   \n  There is also precedent for legislative pardons.\n \n\n   \n  In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II posthumously pardoned Alan Turing, the World War II codebreaker convicted under laws criminalizing homosexuality, and in 2017 the UK government extended the pardon to thousands of other gay and bisexual men convicted under similar statutes. Known as the “Turing Law,” it marked a significant step in acknowledging the injustice of discriminatory legislation.\n \n\n   \n  Councillors in Maidstone hope that a similar approach can be taken to address the legacy of the Witchcraft Act.\n \n\n   \n  “This is about justice,” Harwood said. “We’ve seen the government take steps to right past wrongs. Now it’s time to do the same for the women who were judicially murdered under the guise of witchcraft.”\n \n\n   \n  A Home Office spokesperson told CNN the government would respond to the council’s letter “in due course.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/zohran-mamdani-nypd-idf-video","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:42:00-04:00","title":"Mamdani Explains Why He Said the IDF Had Laced the NYPD’s Boots","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic mayoral nominee in New York, faced renewed scrutiny over a 2023 statement suggesting that the NYPD’s law enforcement actions were influenced or 'laced' by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

about NYC race \n       \n  By Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:54 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Through the final days of this year’s campaign for New York City mayor, Andrew Cuomo has at times lived up to the nickname he earned in the early days of his political career: the prince of darkness.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo  relaunched his mayoral campaign  after his shocking Democratic primary loss, telling New Yorkers he was in it to win it in a video he filmed standing on a tree-lined sidewalk under the July sun. He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism about his candidacy and despair about the  possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani . He has described his run as the last chance New Yorkers will have to save the city from Mamdani’s  democratic socialism , once referring in a debate to the 34-year-old Mamdani as a “kid” and warning that his ideas were radical and unrealistic.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s final general election ad leans on his executive experience and also questions whether Mamdani has enough.\n \n\n   \n  “Life in New York is tough right now,” he says in the ad. “Candidates who need on-the-job training can’t fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s election, early voting numbers were up dramatically ahead of the same point in 2021, reflecting the interest New Yorkers have in a mayoral race unlike any in recent memory. The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  And in a  new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters  released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 16%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.\n \n\n   \n  The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).\n \n\n   \n  Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he  laughed with a radio host  who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11. Cuomo  later said  he believed the host’s comments were offensive as Mamdani accused him of playing to Islamophobia.\n \n\n   \n  Days later, during an appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” host Jon Stewart joked with Mamdani about their back-and-forth.\n \n\n   \n  “You are clearly in the front-runner position right now – I can tell because they have gone 9/11 on you,” Stewart said eliciting laughter from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “The closing argument,” Mamdani responded.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo reframes his legacy\n \n\n   \n  With every post and campaign stop, Cuomo tried a new media strategy while leaning into the legacy items of his 11 years as governor, including  legalizing same-sex marriage  and  raising the minimum wage . In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”\n \n\n   \n   Cuomo resigned  in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.\n \n\n   \n  He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat whose district includes parts of Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America,” Suozzi  wrote on X . “We need leaders who will fight crime, not undermine the police. Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”\n \n\n   \n    Embracing his inner influencer\n \n\n   \n  As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.\n \n\n   \n  Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.\n \n\n   \n  “He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.\n \n\n   \n  He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.\n \n\n   \n  At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.\n \n\n   \n    Experience, experience, experience\n \n\n   \n  Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that  Mamdani’s police reform agenda  would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.\n \n\n   \n  The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets. A former housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, Cuomo said the city had suffered through years of inept governments who could not get projects off the ground.\n \n\n   \n  On the day of Hurricane Sandy’s anniversary in New York City, Cuomo was once again on the trail reminding voters of his experience and what he believed is at stake.\n \n\n   \n  “You need experience. You need the ability. You need the wisdom to know what to do because literally lives depend on you,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Cuomo got the endorsement of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who was in office on the day Hurricane Sandy devastated the city.\n \n\n   \n  Bloomberg, who also endorsed Cuomo in the primary and donated millions to a Cuomo Super PAC, reiterated his support for the governor and highlighted his experience.\n \n\n   \n  “Being Mayor of New York City is the second toughest job in America, and the next mayor will face immense challenges,” Bloomberg wrote in a post on X. “Andrew Cuomo has the experience and toughness to stand up for New Yorkers and get things done.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/tech/amazon-layoffs-andy-jassy-ai-culture","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00Z","title":"Amazon says it didn’t cut 14,000 people because of money.

Not money. Not even AI, but “culture.”\n \n\n   \n  The layoff announcement ﻿this week   was “not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI driven, not right now. It’s culture,” Jassy said in response to an analyst question on the company’s earnings call Thursday. Amazon’s quarterly sales grew 13% year-on-year to $180 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Jassy explained that as Amazon added headcount, locations and lines of business in recent years, “you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers … sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work.”\n \n\n   \n  Amazon’s headcount peaked at more than 1.6 million in 2021; it ended last year with around 1.5 million employees, according to SEC filings.\n \n\n   \n  “It can lead to slowing you down as a leadership team,” he said. “We are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup, and … that means removing layers.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Amazon said this week that the layoffs were more about staying “nimble” in anticipation of future AI efficiencies, the layoffs have nonetheless spurred fears about technology replacing human workers.

Previous studies have suggested that male fetal brains are more susceptible to maternal immune responses, according to the authors of the new study, and the third trimester is a “critical window for brain development.”\n \n\n   \n  The most common diagnoses included disorders in speech and motor function development and autism. About 2.7% of children born to mothers who had Covid-19 while pregnant were diagnosed with autism, compared with about 1.1% of others, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n \n\n   \n  The new findings are “particularly notable in light of their biological plausibility,” the researchers wrote. They build on previous research that identified potential pathways for a maternal Covid-19 infection to affect the developing fetal brain even without direct transmission.\n \n\n   \n  “Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Dr. Lydia Shook, maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in  a news release .\n \n\n   \n  About 1 in 31 children in the US was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, according to a  report  published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in April. The increase — up from 1 in 36 children in 2020 — continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched a “massive testing and research effort” to determine “what has  caused the autism epidemic .”\n \n\n   \n  In a news conference in September on the “ cause of autism ,” President Donald Trump — flanked by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal health leaders – said that use of  Tylenol during pregnancy  can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy also has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence that the two are not connected.\n \n\n   \n  The timeframe of the new study – early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available – meant that ​the researchers were able to “isolate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and offspring neurodevelopment in an unvaccinated population.” About 93% of the mothers included in the assessment had not received any doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Strong infection-control policies at that time also helped reduce the potential for unreported or undetected Covid-19 cases, the researchers said.\n \n\n   \n  “These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development,” Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham and senior author of the new study, said in a news release. “They also support the importance of trying to prevent COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and are particularly relevant when public trust in vaccines – including the COVID-19 vaccine – is being eroded.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/mississippi-police-drug-trafficking-charged","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:46:00Z","title":"Two Mississippi Sheriffs and 12 Officers Charged in Drug Trafficking Bribery Scheme","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal authorities have indicted 20 individuals, including two Mississippi sheriffs, Milton Gaston and Bruce Williams, for allegedly accepting bribes ranging up to $37,000 to provide armed escorts for drug traffickers moving through the Mississippi Delta region.

It also alleged that Gaston attempted to disguise the payments as campaign contributions, but did not report them as required by law.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials said the investigation into the alleged crimes began when people who had been arrested complained about having to pay bribes to various individuals.\n \n\n   \n  “Law enforcement is only effective when the community they protect can trust the law enforcement officers are honestly serving the community’s interests,” Robert Eikhoff, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Jackson Field Office, said. “This type of corruption strikes at the heart of the community.”\n \n\n   \n  Nineteen of the 20 people indicted are also charged with violating federal gun laws.\n \n\n   \n  Court records show that the federal defender’s office is representing 16 of the 20 people charged, including the two sheriffs.

Tate Reeves said in a statement that he was disappointed to learn of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “The law must apply equally to everyone regardless of the title or position they hold,” he wrote. “Know that if you betray the people’s trust in Mississippi, you will face consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Multiple Mississippi law enforcement agencies and sheriffs have faced federal scrutiny in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, the former Hinds County Sheriff Marshand Crisler was  convicted  of accepting $9,500 in bribes and knowingly providing ammunition to a convicted felon. The same year, former Noxubee County Sheriff Terry Grassaree pleaded guilty to  making false statements  to the FBI while being questioned about requesting and receiving nude photos from a female inmate.\n \n\n   \n  William Brewer, a former Tallahatchie County sheriff, was sentenced to  six years  in prison in 2019 for extorting bribes   from a drug dealer.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023, six law enforcement officers pleaded guilty to state and federal charges for  torturing two Black men , a case that sparked a  Department of Justice investigation  into the Rankin County Sheriff’s Office.

Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:47 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump had his fun, with red carpet welcomes, impromptu dances, the  gift of a golden crown  and a yet another  Nobel Peace Prize nomination .\n \n\n   \n  But the trophies from  his Asia tour  won’t count for much when he arrives home Thursday just as the monthlong government shutdown takes its bitterest turn yet amid the worst domestic political crisis of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  His return and a confluence of suddenly harsher  consequences for millions of Americans  mean the next few days may represent the only way out of the increasingly damaging impasse before the run-up to Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re pretending that everything is OK,” Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said this week, berating her colleagues in both parties for failing to act. “We’re pretending that people are not being impacted by this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the showdown, withholding support for a temporary government funding bill last month in an attempt to force Republicans to guarantee extensions for  expanded subsidies  for millions of  Affordable Care Act health plans .\n \n\n   \n  “They are completely and totally uninterested in solving or addressing, decisively, the Republican health care crisis that they’ve created,” House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Wednesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “On November 1, when open enrollment begins, it’s going to be crystal clear to tens of millions of Americans, across the country, that their premiums, copays and deductibles are about to dramatically increase,” Jeffries said.\n \n\n   \n  But Republican leaders are standing firm. They’re offering to discuss extending the credits, but only when Democrats agree to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  A pitiful lack of trust between the parties, the unwillingness of either side to accept the political cost of a climbdown and Trump’s stunning indifference to his own shuttered government led to this stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  And the ramifications of the shutdown are getting quickly worse as the political duel becomes a test of which unfortunate Americans can bear the most pain.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most critical developments, tens of millions of Americans, including children, elderly citizens and those with a disability are set to lose vital food assistance under the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \n \n\n   \n  The blow of soaring health care premiums is also being laid bare. Millions are getting notices showing Obamacare costs shooting up by an average of 26% and in some cases much higher, in the absence of the expiring enhanced subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Which pain point is the worst?” Collins asked Jeffries, referring to Americans hit by rising Obamacare premiums and those facing the potential loss of SNAP benefits. “None of this pain that Republicans have inflicted on the American people is acceptable,” Jeffries replied.\n \n\n   \n  The pressure on government workers — those forced to work without pay and colleagues who are locked out of their jobs — is also worsening.\n \n\n   \n  Flight disruptions are mounting as staff shortages emerge among air traffic controllers, who already operate  under acute stress . The controllers’ mental and emotional challenges are rising since they are  working without pay  — but still face housing, transport and childcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  A new crisis speed bump looms over paying military personnel. Trump accepted a  $130 million donation  from a fellow billionaire to fill the gap left by drained federal funds after reallocating Pentagon funds to meet a first wave of salary payments. But the gift won’t come close to paying wages for 1.3 million military members.\n \n\n   \n  Federal employees, who are spread throughout the 50 states, are getting increasingly desperate. Their financial obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.\n \n\n   \n    Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?\n \n\n   \n  Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.\n \n\n   \n  ► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?\n \n\n   \n  ► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line? Will they risk political fallout from all this misery inflicted on voters already hit by rising inflation and grocery prices, given they have a monopoly on power in Washington?\n \n\n   \n  ► And will Trump, who has managed to defray some of the traditional pressure points during a shutdown, finally discover a political or moral imperative to end it?\n \n\n   \n    A hint of hope as senators talk\n \n\n   \n  A glimmer of hope shone late on Wednesday when details emerged of a  dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators . One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.\n \n\n   \n  Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”\n \n\n   \n  The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue. And after nearly a year of internal mourning over the disastrous 2024 congressional and presidential elections, they found surprising unity in the shutdown. Sometimes, just picking a fight can give a party definition.\n \n\n   \n  But as the pain for millions of Americans mounted, the political clarity over health care blurred. And competing claims emerged. Everett Kelley, the president of the  American Federation of Government Employees  union that represents a wide swath of federal workers, who always opposed a shutdown, warned that it was time for the government to reopen. “I think that it’s vitally important to have health care for everyone … However, I don’t think that this should be built on the backs of federal employees,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are also increasingly wrestling with the possibility that blame for the shutdown could blow back against them. After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans face their own risks.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness. And he hasn’t been able to silence dissent in his conference, including from  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , who keeps accusing her party of negligence over the health care issue. The political equation could shift for Republicans next week if Trump is rebuked in  bellwether elections in Virginia and New Jersey .\n \n\n   \n  And leaving kids hungry could be a disaster. That’s one reason  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to fund SNAP benefits  until the end of the shutdown. Schumer said his party would vote for it. But Republican leaders will be loath to make a move that could alleviate pressure on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If millions of Americans going hungry doesn’t break open the deadlock, the shutdown could drag on even longer. The next potential off-ramp may come in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving with the horrible prospect of an air travel nightmare at the busiest time of the year.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/elise-stefanik-plans-bid-new-york-governor","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:33:00Z","title":"Elise Stefanik Plans to Launch Bid for New York Governor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elise Stefanik, a Republican U.S. representative and close ally of Donald Trump, is preparing to launch a bid for New York governor in 2026, following the city’s mayoral election.

EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department is investigating whether leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement defrauded donors who contributed tens of millions of dollars during racial justice protests in 2020, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, federal law enforcement officials have issued subpoenas and at least one search warrant as part of an investigation into the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. and other Black-led organizations that helped spark a national reckoning on systemic racism, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss an ongoing criminal probe by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  It was not clear if the investigation would result in criminal charges, but its mere existence invites fresh scrutiny to a movement that in recent years has faced criticism about its public accounting of donations received. The recent burst of investigative activity is also unfolding at a time when civil rights groups have raised concerns about the potential for the Trump administration to target a broad variety of progressive and left-leaning groups that have been critical of him, including those affiliated with BLM, the transgender rights movement and anti-ICE protesters.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for the Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people said the investigation had been initiated during the Biden administration but is getting renewed attention during the Trump administration. A second person confirmed that allegations were examined in the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  The foundation said it  took in over $90 million in donations , following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose last breaths under the knee of a White Minneapolis police officer sparked protests across the US and around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the nonprofit foundation, and of the BLM movement broadly, have accused organizers of not being transparent about how it was spending the donations. That criticism grew louder after BLM foundation leaders in 2022 confirmed they used donations to purchase  a $6 million Los Angeles-area property  that includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders previously have denied wrongdoing and publicly released tax documents. No prior investigations into the nonprofit’s finances have yielded proof of impropriety.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation have received subpoenas. In a statement emailed to the AP on Thursday, the foundation said it “is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  “We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,” the foundation said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Black Lives Matter movement first emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old  Trayvon Martin  in Florida. But it was the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, that made the slogan “Black lives matter” a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives.\n \n\n   \n  Movement founders and organizers pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus of BLM chapters. But as the movement’s influence grew, so did the number of organizations that became affiliated with BLM. In 2020, a tidal wave of public contributions in the aftermath of protests over Floyd’s murder came mainly to the BLM foundation, although other organizations were resourced from those funds.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation  opened up about finances and organizational structure in 2022 , revealing detailed accountings of expenditures. The latest Form 990 filing shows the BLM foundation had $28 million in assets for the fiscal year ending June 2024.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation is being run out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles. The top prosecutor there, Bill Essayli, was  disqualified from several cases  earlier this week after a federal judge concluded that the Trump appointee has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law. It’s not clear whether Essayli’s disqualification will impact the BLM investigation. He effectively remains the office’s top prosecutor with a different title of First Assistant United States Attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Essayli had previously served as a Republican assemblyman in California, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s Covid-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against state policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California.\n \n\n   \n  As a private practice attorney, he characterized BLM as a “radical organization” while defending a White couple charged in 2020 with a hate crime after they were videotaped defacing  a BLM mural in Martinez, California .\n \n\n   \n  At the time,  city-sanctioned BLM murals had been painted on roadways  in cities throughout the US in an expression of solidarity with the racial justice movement. Essayli told a San Francisco CBS TV affiliate his clients were simply expressing their political viewpoints and that they disagreed with taxpayer funds being used to “sponsor a radical organization, Black Lives Matters.”\n \n\n   \n  The couple took plea deals to resolve the case in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  At the height of the Floyd-sparked reckoning on racial injustice, some state officials vowed their own investigations in the foundation’s finances, citing their responsibility to protect residents who may have donated to BLM. But most of those probes were resolved without official action.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed a lawsuit against the BLM foundation for failing to comply with an investigation into the organization’s finances. Soon after, a representative of the foundation responded with the necessary information and documentation, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said, and the lawsuit was dismissed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/americas/hurricane-melissa-damage-jamaica-cuba-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:31:00-20:31","title":"Hurricane Melissa Leaves a Trail of Devastation After Tearing Through the Caribbean","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in over 150 years, devastated the Caribbean, reaching a peak of 185 mph and causing widespread destruction in Jamaica, Cuba, the Bahamas, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hurricane Melissa brought devastation and death to the Caribbean as it tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds unleashed widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. At least 30 people have died, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  As the hurricane headed toward Bermuda early Thursday, emergency officials in countries along Melissa’s path have begun to pick up the pieces – clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica, traveled to some of the hardest-hit areas of the island nation Wednesday to survey the significant damage caused by punishing winds and widespread flooding.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the difficulties, the Jamaican spirit shines through as a strong reminder that we are a resilient nation with the capacity to triumph over adversity,” he wrote  on social media .\n \n\n   \n    Path of destruction\n \n\n   \n  In the Caribbean, hotter-than-average waters paired with minimally disruptive winds higher in the atmosphere to create the perfect fuel and prime conditions for Melissa to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa rapidly  intensified , jumping from a 70 mph tropical storm on Saturday morning to a 140 mph Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning.\n \n\n   \n  By Tuesday, Melissa had morphed into a high-end Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, tying it with  four other hurricanes  as the second-strongest storm recorded in the Atlantic since records began in 1851.\n \n\n   \n  As it headed toward Jamaica, where it slammed into the coast as a Category 5 storm on Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned it expected the situation to be “catastrophic.”\n \n\n   \n  “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,” WMO tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said.\n \n\n   \n  Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, it crossed into eastern Cuba, still a formidable Category 3 hurricane by the time it made landfall in the province of Santiago de Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  By the time it reached the Bahamas on Wednesday, Hurricane Melissa had been downgraded to a Category 1, but its broad wind field continued to drive torrential flooding rain, damaging winds and dangerous storm surge at the coast.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were  evacuated in Cuba  as Melissa approached, according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel, while in the Bahamas, preliminary estimates show 1,485 residents were evacuated before all flights were suspended ahead of the approaching storm.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders were also issued for six islands in the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, also felt the cataclysmic impacts of Melissa.\n \n\n   \n    Devastation left behind\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, officials painted a consistent picture of the destruction Melissa left behind.\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions here are devastating. ‘Catastrophic’ is a mild term based on what we are observing here,” Richard Solomon, the mayor of the southwest Jamaican city of Black River, where Hurricane Melissa made landfall, said in a  video  posted by the Jamaica Constabulary Force.\n \n\n   \n  Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government has said.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel push more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Holness  declared  the country a disaster area   Tuesday, as he sought to deter price gouging.\n \n\n   \n  “We must… continue to proactively maintain stability, protect consumers, and prevent any exploitation at a time when citizens are securing food, water, and supplies,” Holness said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 77% of the country was  left  without electricity after Melissa crossed, a spokesperson said. The country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister of local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, Dana Morris Dixon, minister of education, skills, youth and information, said in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  In the already  beleaguered  country of Haiti, 23 people have died and 13 are missing, the country’s Civil Protection Agency said Wednesday. Twenty of the deaths, including 10 children, happened when a flooded river in Petit-Goâve burst its banks, the agency said, revising an earlier death toll of 25 reported by the mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said Hurricane Melissa had wrought “significant” damage on the island.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been a highly complex night, with significant damage reported,” Díaz-Canel wrote on X. “I urge our people to remain vigilant, to uphold discipline, and to continue taking all necessary precautions.”\n \n\n   \n    Recovery efforts\n \n\n   \n  Several international efforts have already been launched to aid in the recovery efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump on Wednesday authorized “an immediate US response” to mobilize support for affected communities in the Caribbean, according to a  statement  released by the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Within hours, Secretary of State Marco Rubio “deployed a regional Disaster Assistance Response Team, including urban search-and-rescue teams, to assess needs and provide search and recovery assistance,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  “The State Department is collaborating with UN agencies, NGOs, and host governments to deliver food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits, temporary shelter, and search and rescue support.”\n \n\n   \n  The Jamaican government launched an  official website  for relief and recovery efforts, where users can access updates on flooding locations or blocked roads and locate shelters.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/james-comey-wants-to-know-doj-lies","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:40:00Z","title":"James Comey’s Lawyers Want DOJ to Explain What They Think He Lied About","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Comey, former FBI Director, is charged with making false statements and obstructing Congress, stemming from a 2020 Senate hearing where he was questioned by GOP Senator Ted Cruz.

John Fetterman was exasperated with his colleagues Thursday, as the Senate heads home in the stalemate’s fifth week and millions of Americans are due to lose federal food assistance this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month, and now things are really going to land, and imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” the Pennsylvania Democrat told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman said his wife helps distribute free food to the community and has already witnessed longer lines. He lamented that when he returns home this weekend, he’ll have to tell constituents who have lost their SNAP benefits, “I don’t have an explanation for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The Democrat, who  has been outspoken  against shutting down the government in any form, has been one of just three in his caucus to routinely break from the party and vote with Republicans more than a dozen times to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate left town on Thursday for the weekend with no measurable progress toward a deal to reopen the government, with impatience inside the US Capitol skyrocketing and  critical social safety net programs at risk  in the coming days. Senators will not return until Monday, which will mark day 34 of the shutdown – just two days shy of setting a new record for longest shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Key senators of both parties took part in some private meetings Thursday to discuss potential off-ramps, including how to get both parties to support a deal on long-term appropriations bills.

I mean, that’s a disgrace.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to find a way forward,” the senator said. He added that while he “fundamentally” believes there will be an effort to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, as his fellow Democrats are demanding, his party must also consider those who receive other important benefits from the government.\n \n\n   \n  “You have 2 million people on SNAP in my state, and over 400,000 are receiving those kind of tax credits,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “For a Democrat, I can’t imagine a more sacred part of who we fight for is people that, that depend on SNAP to feed themselves,” he said, later adding, “Our party has bigger problems than I thought we might have already. It’s like that’s not controversial. Pay everybody.”\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t even get our shit together and just open up our government,” he lamented.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s prior suggestion that each day of the shutdown plays better politically for Democrats, Fetterman responded, “Ask the hungry people on Saturday.”\n \n\n   \n  “Americans are not leverage.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that provided an early glimpse into how the iPhone 17 lineup may be catching on so far.   \n \n\n   \n  Apple’s earnings for the quarter that ended in September met analysts’ expectations on revenue but slightly missed on iPhone sales.   iPhone sales in the fourth quarter were $49 billion, up from $46.2 billion compared to the same period a   year ago but slightly lower than the $50.1 billion Wall Street was expecting. Overall revenue was $102.5 billion, an increase from $94.9 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Apple says both revenue and iPhone sales   numbers represent a record for the fourth   quarter. Services revenue, another closely watched metric ,  also hit an   all-time record at $28.8 billion, an increase from roughly $25 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  During Apple’s earnings call on Thursday,   CEO Tim Cook said the company expects the December quarter’s revenue “to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for the iPhone,” suggesting strong iPhone 17 sales.\n \n\n   \n  Apple shares were up around 3% in after-hours trading.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street is looking for assurance that Apple’s biggest revenue driver is still growing despite concerns that the company is behind in the AI race. Analysts had estimated strong demand for the iPhone 17 lineup, which Apple launched in late September.\n \n\n   \n  However, overall sales in China   shrunk compared to a year ago, with the company generating $14.5 billion in revenue in the region. In 2024, Apple earned $15 billion during the same period. Cook said on Thursday that he expects iPhone revenue to return to growth in China in the current quarter based on how the iPhone 17 is being received.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s results paint an early picture of iPhone sales since its fourth quarter ended on September 27, eight days after the iPhone 17 launch. Still, it’s possible that sales slowed in the July and August months as consumers waited for the iPhone 17.\n \n\n   \n  The iPhone 17 series outsold its predecessor by 14% in its first 10 days in the United States and China, according to  Counterpoint Research , with the base iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Max being the most in demand. The iPhone Air, touted as the thinnest iPhone ever, is seeing “muted customer interest” according to UBS, which has been tracking retail wait times for new iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  Apple’s iPhone business is always under a microscope as the company’s largest revenue driver. But the tech industry is particularly paying close attention, prompted by speculation that another AI-powered gadget may eventually supplant the smartphone.\n \n\n   \n  While analysts previously grilled Apple about its AI strategy on recent earnings calls, Wall Street was more interested in the factors driving iPhone demand and the impact of tariffs. Apple said it expects to incur $1.4 billion in tariff-related costs this quarter.\n \n\n   \n  But Cook said he sees “opportunities on the App Store” for AI when asked about whether the rise of chatbots and AI apps will change how consumers use apps. He also said Apple Intelligence — a suite of AI-powered features for the iPhone and the company’s other products — is motivating people to upgrade their iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  “I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we’re very bullish on it becoming a greater factor, and that’s the way that we look at it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Apple delayed an update to Siri earlier this year that would have brought it closer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.

He’s spent years trying to turn people who launched the worst attack on the US Capitol in two centuries into sympathetic figures. He even pardoned a bunch of people who assaulted police that day, despite  more than 8 in 10 Americans opposing that .\n \n\n   \n  But sometimes something comes along that completely drives the whole thing home.\n \n\n   \n  That’s what happened this week, in the  case of Taylor Taranto .\n \n\n   \n  To recap: Taranto was among those pardoned by Trump for his actions on January 6. But before that pardon, he committed an unrelated crime. In 2023, he was arrested in former President Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, neighborhood with numerous firearms and materials to make explosives. He was convicted in May.\n \n\n   \n  By late Tuesday, a reporter at Politico noted something interesting: Prosecutors in their sentencing memo for Taranto noted his presence in the “mob of rioters” on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building,” the  sentencing memo  said. “After the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  This wouldn’t normally be surprising, mind you. It’s a factual statement that notes the defendant isn’t a newcomer to legal trouble.\n \n\n   \n  But it  was  notable next to Trump’s own rhetoric about January 6 – and given the Trump DOJ’s efforts to  force out a batch of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases.\n \n\n   \n  Sure enough, mere hours later the prosecutors on the case – Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White – were  placed on leave . Then their sentencing memo was pulled from the docket and replaced with a new one, signed by different prosecutors, that excised the paragraph on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  And just in case it wasn’t clear that the changes were made to benefit Trump, consider another change to the sentencing memo.\n \n\n   \n  The other interesting aspect of Taranto’s crime is Trump’s proximity to it. In fact, Taranto was apprehended near Obama’s home  shortly after Trump reshared a post that included an alleged address for the former president  to social media. Prosecutors said Taranto began livestreaming in the area shortly after promoting Trump’s post.\n \n\n   \n  The new sentencing memo also removed a reference to that fact.\n \n\n   \n  The US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, declined to shed light on why the prosecutors were put on leave.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the papers speak for themselves, and what goes on in this office is not something that I’m going to comment on. Thank you,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n  We still have plenty to learn about what happened here. But it’s one of the most glaring examples of the fruits of Trump’s long-running campaign to retcon January 6 – and to turn it into anything other than a tragic day for our country and our democracy.\n \n\n   \n  After the dust settled on that day, Trump and some allies in Congress began suggestively questioning how violent the day was, with one GOP congressman infamously comparing it to a “ normal tourist visit .”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump launched his 2024 campaign, he began featuring a  music video from a choir of January 6 defendants  that effectively lionized them. He began talking about the defendants as if they were ill-treated political “hostages,” often  citing misinformation  in the process.\n \n\n   \n  Then he, on his first day back in office, pardoned nearly all of them – even the worst offenders.\n \n\n   \n  But that was merely the first step.\n \n\n   \n  We’ve also seen a  purge of dozens of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases, despite them merely enforcing the law. Trump’s Justice Department agreed to  settle a wrongful death suit for $5 million with the family of Ashli Babbitt , who was killed after breaking into a sensitive area of the Capitol, cementing her status as a martyr for some portions of the extreme right. The administration has also  pressured the Smithsonian , which has in some cases  softened its language about the events that day . The president and allies have continued to overhype  relatively minor   disclosures  about the government’s actions vis-a-vis January 6, which took place while Trump was in office, as if they proved a massive conspiracy against Trump and the GOP. The House is now undertaking an investigation that  appears aimed at recasting the narrative  of that day.\n \n\n   \n  Oh, and we recently learned Trump is reportedly  seeking $230 million  from his own government for alleged damages from the January 6 probe and other federal investigations. (Trump was never tried in these cases, which were dropped after he was reelected president, but nor was he acquitted.)\n \n\n   \n  If anything epitomizes Trump’s attempts to turn those who fueled what happened on January 6 into victims, it’s surely that. Even if you don’t think Trump committed a crime, the people who attacked the Capitol were clearly spurred by his lies about voter fraud and the supposedly stolen election.\n \n\n   \n  Trump just keeps pushing the envelope here, and we keep seeing that manifest itself in actions by his Justice Department and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  The question from there is whether he’s able to actually rewrite history in Americans’ minds.\n \n\n   \n  To this point, that’s been  a tough slog . Trump’s pardons of violent January 6 defendants were overwhelmingly unpopular. Strong majorities of Americans still regard that day as an attack against democracy.\n \n\n   \n  But we’ve also seen a steady downgrading of the right’s views on that day.\n \n\n   \n  By mid-2021, a Monmouth University poll showed 62% of Republicans labeled that day a “riot,” and 33% called it an “insurrection.” Two years later, though, those numbers  dropped significantly – to 44% and 15%, respectively .\n \n\n   \n  In that way, the erasure of the “mob of rioters” from the memo reflects how the political right has come to view that day.\n \n\n   \n  But that doesn’t mean it’s a reflection of the truth.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/us-nuclear-testing-trump-advisers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:13:00Z","title":"Trump Announces U.S. Nuclear Testing Plans Amid China Summit, Prompting Diplomatic and Strategic Concerns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a surprising move just minutes before a high-level summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year moratorium, citing the growing nuclear capabilities of other nations, including China.

testing nukes. It caught even some advisers by surprise. \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:13 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Chinese leader Xi Jinping inserted a reference to “twists and turns” in his relationship with  President Donald Trump  in the opening remarks of their summit this week, he could hardly have imagined the twist that came minutes before the talks began.\n \n\n   \n  Writing from Marine One, which was gliding toward the airport in South Korea where he was due to meet Xi, Trump  instructed the Pentagon  to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing other nations’ — including China’s — own capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  “That process will begin immediately,” the president wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  The directive took even many of Trump’s advisers off guard, according to officials, leading to unanswered questions about when, or if, the testing would actually begin. Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.\n \n\n   \n  Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”\n \n\n   \n  “To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”\n \n\n   \n  Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n  A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”\n \n\n   \n  He seemed less cautious in his  Truth Social message  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.\n \n\n   \n  “With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”\n \n\n   \n  If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.\n \n\n   \n  “The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.\n \n\n   \n  In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.\n \n\n   \n  In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”\n \n\n   \n  “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.\n \n\n   \n  “If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-guard-quick-reaction-force","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:53:00Z","title":"Trump’s National Guard quick reaction force largely already exists, officials say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Pentagon is implementing President Donald Trump’s August 2025 executive order to establish a standing National Guard quick reaction force across all states, but officials confirm that such forces already exist in the form of the National Guard Reaction Force and the Homeland Response Force.

already exists, officials say \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:53 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon is moving forward on orders from President Donald Trump to build a National Guard quick reaction force in each state for domestic use, though two US officials say the effort is largely making incremental changes to a mission the Guard already undertakes.\n \n\n   \n  Trump ordered that the Pentagon “ensure the availability of a standing National Guard quick reaction force that shall be resourced, trained, and available for rapid nationwide deployment,” in an August  executive order .\n \n\n   \n  But the two officials said those reaction forces already exist.\n \n\n   \n  “This whole thing – we’re already doing it,” one of the US officials said. “This is just updated guidance.”\n \n\n   \n  The officials said that plans are being developed within the Defense Department and National Guard for possible additional training or increase to the number of personnel available for existing units to meet the new requirement.\n \n\n   \n  Internal Pentagon guidance directs that most states have roughly 500 individuals dedicated to the reaction force, one of the officials said, though that number could vary depending on the size of the state.\n \n\n   \n  Some states may have to increase the size of their Guard contingent dedicated to the mission to meet that guidance.\n \n\n   \n  The Guardian was first to report on the guidance, which was issued earlier this month, with the director of operations for the Pentagon’s National Guard bureau outlining troop numbers for the quick reaction forces ordered by Trump including a total of roughly 23,500 troops nationally.\n \n\n   \n  The Guard already has two types of forces that meet this mission – the National Guard Reaction Force and the Homeland Response Force.\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard Reaction Force in each state provides “a rapid response capability focused on incidents requiring defense support of civilian authorities,” a publicly available fact sheet says.\n \n\n   \n  When needed, that force is meant to be able to deploy 25% of its personnel within the first eight hours, 50% of its personnel within 12 hours, and the entire contingent within 24 hours. Their mission, according to the fact sheet, includes civil disturbance control and personnel and site security.\n \n\n   \n  The Homeland Response Force, meanwhile, is meant to be able to assemble within six hours and support emergency response chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive disasters. Within that force, the US official said, is a group of roughly 200 US soldiers whose job is riot and crowd control.\n \n\n   \n  Those forces are organized matching the 10 regions the Federal Emergency Management Agency uses to subdivide US land, the US official said, meaning they are responsible for responding first for a group of states and/or territories. Region 2, for example, includes New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon guidance comes as the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to use the Guard in various states as support to law enforcement and immigration officials. The administration has been caught up in legal disputes over its deployment of the Guard in  Los Angeles ,  Portland , and  Chicago , and CNN reported Wednesday that orders for the National Guard in Washington, DC, have been  extended into 2026 .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/thanksgiving-travel-shutdown-vance-duffy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:49:00Z","title":"Vance and Duffy warn Thanksgiving travel ‘could be a disaster’ if shutdown barrels on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have issued urgent warnings that the ongoing government shutdown could lead to a major travel disaster during Thanksgiving 2025, due to unpaid federal workers — particularly FAA air traffic controllers — being forced to work without pay.

It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving. We want people to be able to travel for business,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy chimed in adding, “Our traffic will be snarled, but it will be a disaster in aviation.”\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines CEO Robert Isom, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels, Teamsters President Sean O’Brien and American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley were among those who attended Thursday’s roundtable, the officials said, in addition to nine other industry leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Behind closed doors, Vance and Duffy listened as O’Brien and Kelley laid out their concerns about the stress on their workforce, the officials told CNN. Meanwhile Isom and Kirby, in addition to a series of other airline association leaders, made clear just how damaging the shutdown was not only to their industry, but also the larger economy.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy told the group that he was working on recruiting more air traffic controllers as a temporary solution, arguing that they are most affected, they said.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting came as air traffic controllers missed their first full paycheck of the shutdown this week. Controllers, employed by the FAA, are among the government employees required to continue working without pay.\n \n\n   \n  During the first Trump administration, controller staffing shortages helped   tip the scales  to end the longest government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, the decision by 10 air traffic controllers to call out sick temporarily shut down travel at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and caused delays at other major hubs in New Jersey, Philadelphia and Atlanta, driving President Donald Trump to agree to a temporary government funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis found that reports of staffing problems at FAA facilities have more than quadrupled compared to the same period a year ago, raising broad concern over the fast-approaching Thanksgiving holiday.\n \n\n   \n  Geoff Freeman, the CEO of the US Travel Association who also attended the meeting, told CNN in a statement: “Sixty percent of Americans are already reconsidering their travel plans during the shutdown. It is costing the travel industry $1 billion a week in economic damage and that is before we get to the most important travel week of the year.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the issues that were raised on Thursday, Vance maintained the administration’s position that the only way out of this was for Democrats to pass a clean spending bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Freeman, as well as O’Brien and Kirby, have all now joined Republicans in calling for Congress to pass the short-term funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  “Congress should pass a clean continuing resolution now,” Freeman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Vance reiterated that point when addressing reporters after the meeting, acknowledging that the key issue Democrats have fought with the GOP over — healthcare subsidies expiring — are valid, but that those negotiations would not happen “at the barrel of a gun.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrats response to that is, give us everything we want, or we’re going to shut down the government and keep it shut down. That is not reasonable behavior,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance added that Republicans “can’t reward” Democrats for using the shutdown as a negotiating tool, because if it works, they will continue to use it — a point the officials said he also made during the roundtable.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how a child behaves.

The result? $1 million for kids suffering with cancer \n       \n  By Krista Bo Polanco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:44 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jeff Robertson didn’t take Halloween decorations seriously until 2020, when he wanted to make his kids smile during the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  Every year since, his yard in Holly Springs, North Carolina — and hundreds more across the country –— has been full of plastic skeletons of all sizes for a haunting but heartwarming cause, raising  more than $1 million  for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n \n\n   \n  That first year, with his windows boarded up, the display’s theme was a house under attack by what Robertson called a “skeleton army” scaling the walls.\n \n\n   \n  When a local news crew covered it, the 54-year-old father of two and Air Force veteran saw a chance to do more than entertain.\n \n\n   \n  “I asked my kids how we could use that attention to help others,” he told CNN. “My son and daughter said, ‘Hey, let’s help St. Jude. We want to help sick children get out of the hospital so they can see all these neat Halloween decorations.’”\n \n\n   \n  So the family printed a simple sign on their front yard that said in part: If you like what you see, feel free to donate to St. Jude – a leading children’s hospital for kids with cancer and other diseases.\n \n\n   \n  Within days, Robertson said a car pulled up with an emotional couple and their young daughter in the backseat. The tearful father told Robertson that they’re a St. Jude family and wanted to thank him for raising money for pay for treatment for families like them.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson didn’t get their names and they never saw each other again. But that encounter changed everything for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d been looking for purpose after retiring from the service,” he said. “This little girl was going through such a tough time, but she saw these goofy plastic skeletons in my yard, it put her in an awesome place.”\n \n\n   \n  The family raised  over $8,000 in 2020  – and the next year, Robertson created a Facebook group called Skeletons for St. Jude to spread the idea nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  This spooky season, the group has more than 5,000 members, and over 1,000 partner homes across the country have joined the cause and raised funds. On October 21, they officially hit the $1 million mark.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson’s neighborhood in North Carolina looks forward to his epic display every year with scores of visitors stopping by every day all month long to soak in the skeleton spectacle.\n \n\n   \n  It takes Robertson a whole year to plan the theme and build new props. He’s accumulated 100 or so toy skeletons that he keeps in storage, and he adds onto the display every day until Halloween — so there’s always something new for visitors to see.\n \n\n   \n  This October, skeletons are sailing on a 25-foot phantom pirate ship that Robertson has positioned so it appears to have crashed through the first and second stories of his house.\n \n\n   \n  “The real focus isn’t on me,” Robertson said. “It’s on the thousands of people giving five or ten dollars here and there. That’s what made this a success.”\n \n\n   \n  Robertson is grateful knowing this money will help families focus on getting their kids better. And he says those families are motivating him to raise another $1 million in half the time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/media/mtg-the-view-marjorie-taylor-greene-abc-disney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:09:00Z","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene to Appear on 'The View' Amid Political Pivot","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial Republican congresswoman from Georgia known for her fierce rhetoric and public clashes with 'The View', is set to appear on the show next Tuesday.

said they want more conservatives to appear on the show. Next week, they’re getting one of the most outspoken: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n \n\n   \n  The MAGA congresswoman from Georgia, long known for her fiery rhetoric and penchant for political brawling, will appear on the ABC daytime talk show next Tuesday, co-host Whoopi Goldberg announced during Thursday’s broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  After the show briefly discussed Greene as an example of a Republican lawmaker who has begun to break with her party, Goldberg said, “I’m happy to say that she’s going to be here on Tuesday.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene confirmed the news in an  X post , sharing a clip of Goldberg’s announcement and writing, “I look forward to joining the ladies on The View on Tuesday!”\n \n\n   \n  The booking of Greene is remarkable given the congresswoman’s years-long, antagonistic posture towards both “The View” and its owners at Disney. She once  railed against  “the angry, nasty women on The View” and  publicly beefed  with co-host   Joy Behar. Greene has also accused Disney of being “ pro-child predator ” for its opposition to Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “The View” co-hosts have often criticized Greene’s behavior and rhetoric. In 2023, co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump aide,  mocked Greene for sporting  a fur-collared jacket to a State of the Union address, saying “it looked like she skinned my puppy.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s appearance on “The View” will come amid the congresswoman’s apparent pivot into a rogue conservative figure willing to break with Republican leaders, especially over their shutdown strategy. (She is also set to  make her late-night TV debut  this Friday on Bill Maher’s HBO talk show; HBO and CNN share a corporate owner.)\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, “The View”  praised  Greene, calling her “the surprising voice of reason” on the GOP side of the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a dark day when Marjorie Taylor Greene is the voice of reason, but you know what they say about a blind squirrel,” Farah Griffin said. “They find a nut every now and then.”\n \n\n   \n  “Frankly, we should invite her on,” co-host Ana Navarro said.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks later, “The View” did just that.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/justice-edited-court-documents-trump-january-6","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:15:00-04:15","title":"‘Orwellian’: Current and former prosecutors alarmed after DOJ scrubs mentions of Trump and January 6 from court records","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department faced widespread criticism for removing references to former President Donald Trump's social media post about Barack Obama's address and Taylor Taranto’s participation in the January 6 Capitol riot from official court records.

alarmed after DOJ scrubs mentions of Trump and January 6 from court records \n       \n  By Katelyn  Polantz, Holmes Lybrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:15 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department’s decision to sideline two US attorneys and remove mentions of Donald Trump and the US Capitol attack from court papers before the sentencing of a pardoned January 6 rioter is being viewed by former and current career prosecutors as an alarming whitewashing of history.\n \n\n   \n  The events around the case of Taylor Taranto, who was convicted of bringing illegal guns near Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, residence after talking online about violence toward the federal government, has shocked the network of Justice Department employees and alumni, several sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested in June 2023 after claiming on an internet livestream that he had a detonator the day before, law enforcement officials  told CNN at the time,  and was searching for underground tunnels that led inside Obama and others’ homes.\n \n\n   \n  He had also been present at the Capitol riot and charged with related crimes, though he was never convicted because Trump pardoned him before a trial. He has already spent 23 months behind bars and hasn’t been detained since he was pardoned.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Carl Nichols, a 2019 Trump appointee, had found him guilty at trial in May of the gun crimes and for making a false threat to use a car bomb against a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  In a  sentencing memo for Taranto filed Tuesday , prosecutors Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White wrote that after “then-former President Donald Trump published on a social media platform the purported address of former President Barack Obama,” Taranto had re-posted Trump “and thereafter started livestreaming from his van” as he drove through Obama’s neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s original post – which included the Obama address – was itself a repost of a blog article.\n \n\n   \n  Politico reporter Kyle Cheney highlighted the filing and mentioned it also included Taranto taking part in the January 6 riot, on the social media platform X late Tuesday night. Within 24 hours, the court filing was no longer available in the court record and the two prosecutors who had signed it were suspended from their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  In the original memo, Valdivia and White wrote that “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building” and “after the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  Two new prosecutors then  filed an amended version  of the sentencing memo to the court on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  That new memo scrubbed all references to Trump and him posting Obama’s supposed address – which Taranto had reposted – as well as Taranto’s participation and conviction related to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s shocking that prosecutors could be put on leave for accurately stating the court record in a sentencing memo, and it’s just as shocking that those truthful statements have been whitewashed in a revised filing,” said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department attorney and now executive director and founder of Justice Connection, which works to represent the viewpoints of former federal prosecutors, especially those who have been fired by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “These prosecutors did their job and upheld their duty of candor by informing the court of clearly established facts relevant to their case,” Young added.\n \n\n   \n  Jeanine Pirro, the US Attorney in Washington, DC, did not comment on the suspensions and filing changes when asked about it during a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the papers speak for themselves, and what goes on in this office is not something that I’m going to comment on. Thank you,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Orwellian’\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the moves made by the Justice Department had employees reeling within the US Attorney’s Office in DC and the FBI, which had investigated and caught Taranto, believing he was a danger to the public in 2023, people familiar with the office told CNN on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One source called the sentencing memo change “Orwellian.”\n \n\n   \n  Valdivia had no indication he may have employment issues — especially given that on Tuesday, the day before his suspension, he helped to secure a guilty verdict from a jury in a fraud case where he was on the trial team, according to two people familiar with the US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, White is a supervisor on Superior Court cases and was a US Marine.\n \n\n   \n  A Justice Department spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday following the suspensions: “While we don’t comment on personnel decisions, we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously. We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson declined to clarify if the comments were about Taranto’s 2023 actions toward Obama, or his participation in the Capitol riot in 2021, in which a mob of Trump supporters injured multiple people, including many police protecting the federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The move by Justice Department officials to place the two attorneys on leave and erase all mention of Trump posting Obama’s address or Taranto’s participation in the events of January 6 comes at a time when administration officials have already worked to fire scores of federal prosecutors and officers they see as potential roadblocks in their efforts to use the DOJ against political opponents.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia were recently pushed out of the Justice Department after failing to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and many prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases were removed from the DC US Attorney’s office earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n    Taranto sentenced to 21 months\n \n\n   \n  When Taranto was initially investigated, one source said, he had been on federal law enforcement radar because he had been at the January 6 riot. But federal authorities focused on him after he livestreamed a video in 2023 where he threatened bombing federal facilities, and law enforcement then arrested him near Obama’s Washington address.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by Nichols of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ continued to seek the 27-month sentence originally sought by White and Valdivia, who said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto’s attorney asked the court to sentence him to time served in jail already, with no further detention. The defense attorney, Carmen Hernandez, has asked for rehabilitation that the court could order, noting Taranto’s past military service and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, according to a filing on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Typically, a defendant’s history and characteristics become part of court arguments for or against leniency when a judge decides a sentence.\n \n\n   \n  At a hearing Thursday, Nichols sentenced Taranto to 21 months in prison, essentially covered by time served.\n \n\n   \n  Nichols found that Taranto “made troubling statements” in his online livestream but noted he had no criminal history and his conduct “was far from egregious.”\n \n\n   \n  Taranto spoke briefly during Thursday’s hearing, not to apologize for his conduct but to highlight a book on the 1787 constitutional convention and mention that some people questioned the results of the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to keep people’s minds open,” he concluded.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also said he thought the two prosecutors placed on leave “upheld the highest standard” throughout the case.\n \n\n   \n  “My view is that they did a commendable and exceptional job,” Nichols said of the prosecutors, adding that he felt “they did a truly excellent job in this case.”\n \n\n   \n  White and Valdivia attended Taranto’s sentencing and declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz and Casey Gannon contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/gift-tracker-trump-foreign-leaders-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:24:00-04:00","title":"Gold crown, golf clubs and a jet: Tracking Trump’s gifts from foreign leaders this year","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article examines the diplomatic gifts given to Donald Trump by foreign leaders during his second term, highlighting extravagant items such as a gold crown, golf clubs, and a jet.

3I/ATLAS just made its closest pass of the sun. Discover where it’s going next \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An interstellar comet that originated outside our solar system just made its closest pass of the sun, setting it on an outgoing path — but it’s not leaving our cosmic neighborhood yet.\n \n\n   \n  The comet, dubbed 3I/ATLAS, came within about   126 million miles (203 million kilometers) of our star, according to  EarthSky . The object is currently behind the sun from the perspective of ground-based telescopes on Earth, but astronomers anticipate being able to view the comet again in a few weeks, said Darryl Seligman, assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University.\n \n\n   \n  Stargazers using telescopes should be able to see the object in the predawn sky beginning November 11, according to EarthSky.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers will have a few more months to observe the comet before it begins heading   out of our solar system, Seligman said.\n \n\n   \n  The comet will make its closest approach of Earth on December 19, coming within about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) — but it poses no threat to our planet, according to the  European Space Agency .\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers have been observing the comet, only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, since its discovery on July 1.\n \n\n   \n  Each observation is shedding light on this interstellar object and how different it may be from comets that originated in our solar system.\n \n\n   \n    The ingredients of an interstellar comet\n \n\n   \n  Comets are like dirty snowballs left over from the formation of solar systems.\n \n\n   \n  A comet’s nucleus is its solid core, made of ice, dust and rocks. When comets travel near stars such as the sun, heat causes them to release gas and dust, which creates their signature tails.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers are interested in capturing as many observations of the comet as they can because as it nears the sun, material releasing from the object could reveal more about its composition — and the star system where it originated.\n \n\n   \n  “When it gets closest to the sun, you get the most holistic view of the nucleus possible,” Seligman said. “One of the main things driving most cometary scientists is, what is the composition of the volatiles? It shows you the initial primordial material that it formed from.”\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have used powerful tools, such as the Hubble Space and James Webb Space telescopes, along with a multitude of space-based missions, such as  SPHEREx , to study the comet.\n \n\n   \n  The SPHEREx and Webb observations detected carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide,  carbonyl sulphide  and water ice releasing from the comet as it neared the sun, according to the ESA.\n \n\n   \n  Preliminary estimates indicate that the interstellar comet is 3 billion   to 11 billion years old, according to a  study  coauthored by Seligman and Aster Taylor, a doctoral student and Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Fellow at the University of Michigan, in August. For reference, our solar system is estimated to be about 4.6 billion years old.\n \n\n   \n  Carbon dioxide turns directly from a solid into a gas in response to temperature changes much more easily than most elements — which means the comet has likely never been close to another star before its brush with the sun, Seligman said.\n \n\n   \n    All eyes on 3I/ATLAS\n \n\n   \n  The interstellar comet faded from the view of ground-based telescopes in October, but it remained in sight for missions such as  PUNCH , or Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, and  SOHO , or the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. The object also made its closest approach of Mars on October 3, coming within 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) of the red planet — and the spacecraft orbiting it.\n \n\n   \n  While the government shutdown has prevented data sharing from any NASA missions that have observed the comet since October 1, the ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter attempted to capture views of 3I/ATLAS in October.\n \n\n   \n  The cameras aboard those missions are designed to study the relatively close, bright surface of Mars, but ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter managed to observe the comet as a fuzzy white dot.\n \n\n   \n  “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the orbiter’s camera, said in a statement, noting the comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times “fainter than our usual target.”\n \n\n   \n  ESA’s  Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer , or Juice, will also attempt to observe 3I/ATLAS in November using multiple instruments despite the comet being farther from the spacecraft than it was when observed by   the Mars orbiters. But astronomers don’t expect to receive the observations until February due to the rate at which the spacecraft is sending data back to Earth.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got several more months to observe it,” Seligman said. “And there’s going to be amazing science that comes out.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/style/royal-lodge-prince-andrew-gbr-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00Z","title":"Everything we know about Royal Lodge, Prince Andrew’s 30-room mansion in Windsor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, King Charles III announced that Prince Andrew would be stripped of his 'prince' title and ordered to vacate Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park where he had lived since 2003.

\n       \n  By Lianne Kolirin and Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:07 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s King Charles has announced that his brother,  Andrew , will be stripped of his “ prince ” title and ordered to leave Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion that has been his home since 2003, over the swirling Jeffrey Epstein scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the sprawling property in Windsor Great Park, west of London, that is home to Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and where their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, spent much of their teenage years\n \n\n   \n    Why does Andrew live in Royal Lodge?\n \n\n   \n  The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, which is officially owned by the Crown Estate. The prince paid £1 million for the property in 2003, and under the terms of the 75-year lease, which was due to expire on June 15, 2078, he was expected to pay for any refurbishment work and the maintenance of the surrounding grounds.\n \n\n   \n  He was also required upfront to pay £7.5 million ($10 million) to cover necessary refurbishments that were completed in 2005, according to a  National Audit Office report.  According to the lease, signed on August 8, 2003, rent “if demanded” was only required to be “one peppercorn” per annum.\n \n\n   \n  The property sits in an estate of 40 hectares (99 acres) and features a swimming pool, an aviary, six lodge cottages, a gardener’s cottage and accommodation for police protecting the royals to stay in.\n \n\n   \n  It is situated within Windsor Great Park, close to Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage (where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously lived) and Forest Lodge, the Windsor residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n \n\n   \n  There had been intense media speculation in recent weeks over Prince Andrew’s continued occupancy of Royal Lodge. Before Thursday’s announcement, Buckingham Palace and the Crown Estate had declined to comment on reports that he was in talks to leave the residence.\n \n\n   \n    Two centuries of royal residents\n \n\n   \n  A house has stood on the site since at least the 1660s, although it has undergone considerable updates and renovations since then. Its first links with the royal family came in the early 19th century when George IV, then the prince regent, converted the rustic-styled cottage into a hunting lodge and then private retreat. By the mid-1820s it had become known as Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  After George died in 1830, much of the structure was pulled down by William IV and it was used as a “grace and favor” residence for most of the rest of the century.\n \n\n   \n  The Royal Chapel was added to the site in 1865, but, though situated within the grounds of the lodge, it does not come under the current lease.\n \n\n   \n  The property was rebuilt during the 1930s around a room remaining from George IV’s original cottage.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, lived in the lodge as a child, moving there with her parents — then the Duke and Duchess of York — in 1932. The family remained at Royal Lodge until the duke and duchess were crowned four years later, following the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n  Following her husband’s death in 1952 and the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother used the Royal Lodge as her Windsor residence until her death in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  After his grandmother died, Prince Andrew approached the Crown Estate about acquiring the leasehold on the property. The property was not offered to the wider market because of its sensitive location in the heart of Windsor Great Park and the need for security, given its proximity to the Royal Chapel.\n \n\n   \n    What changes has Andrew made?\n \n\n   \n  The renovation work that Andrew carried out on the family property included internal alterations to the tiled ceiling, external repainting, new tarmac for the gate entrance and light fittings and cameras for outside the lodge, according to a planning application lodged with the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier planning applications show that the local authorities granted permission to build a single-story property to accommodate police officers protecting the site in 1990, and permission was given for the construction of a conservatory in 2001.\n \n\n   \n    Queen Elizabeth’s fairy-tale playhouse\n \n\n   \n  Also in the grounds is Y Bwthyn Bach, which translates from Welsh as “little cottage.” The miniature thatched cottage was given by the people of Wales to the late Queen Elizabeth II on her sixth birthday and was where she and her sister, Princess Margaret, played as children — as did their children and grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n  In a 2012 BBC documentary called “The Diamond Queen,” Princess Beatrice said she and her sister had been “lucky enough” to play there together with their cousins as children.\n \n\n   \n  She described it as the “most glamorous Wendy house ever” and said that she spent about a year overseeing its renovation. This, she said, involved new wiring, new curtains and completely rethatching the cottage to give it a “bit of a spruce-up.”   \n \n\n   \n  Viewers got to see the princess take host Andrew Marr inside the miniature property, which was fully furnished and complete with furniture, crockery and glassware and a fridge from the 1930s.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Prince Andrew and his former wife hosted the wedding celebrations for their younger daughter, Eugenie, and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, at the lodge following the official ceremony at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.   \n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Eugenie’s sister, Beatrice, tied the knot on the estate itself, marrying Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a small ceremony in the chapel while Covid-19 restrictions were in place.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/basketball-nba-nikola-topic-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:54:00Z","title":"Oklahoma City Thunder Guard Nikola Topic Diagnosed With Testicular Cancer and Undergoing Chemotherapy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Oklahoma City Thunder guard Nikola Topic has been diagnosed with testicular cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy.

consumers’ credit scores from medical debt \n       \n  By Noam N. Levey, KFF Health News\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:49 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration took another step Tuesday to weaken protections for Americans with medical debt, issuing new guidance that threatens ongoing state efforts to keep that debt off consumers’ credit reports.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen states, including Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Maryland, New York, and most of New England, have enacted laws in recent years to keep medical debt from affecting consumers’ credit.\n \n\n   \n  And more states — including several in conservative regions of the Midwest and Mountain West —  have been considering  similar protections, spurred by bipartisan concerns that medical debt on a credit report can make it harder for people to get a home, a car, or a job.\n \n\n   \n  Nationwide,  about 100 million people  have some form of health care debt, with millions burdened by $10,000 or more in unpaid bills.\n \n\n   \n  But  in the new guidance , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau asserts that federal law bars states from restricting medical debts from credit reports, arguing that only the federal government has this authority.\n \n\n   \n  “Congress meant to occupy the field of consumer reporting and displace state laws,” the bureau concluded in an “interpretive rule” signed by Russell Vought, the White House budget director and acting head of the CFPB.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance, which offers a new interpretation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, reverses policies advanced under former President Joe Biden that sought to empower states to expand protections for people with medical debt.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s latest move will not immediately roll back existing state protections.\n \n\n   \n  But advocates for patients and consumers warn that the new guidance may stall progress elsewhere, just as millions of Americans are poised to lose federal aid that helps them buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The aid is tied up in the current budget showdown between congressional Republicans and Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “You’d be hard-pressed to find a crueler regulatory interpretation,” said Elisabeth Benjamin, a vice president for the Community Service Society of New York. The nonprofit has pushed for medical debt protections in that state.\n \n\n   \n  Lucy Culp, who oversees state lobbying efforts by Blood Cancer United, formerly known as the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, warned that the Trump administration’s guidance could reverberate across the country. “This rule will have a chilling effect on states’ willingness to pass these critical patient protections,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The new CFPB guidance might spur more litigation challenging state restrictions on medical debt credit reporting.\n \n\n   \n  Trade groups representing credit reporting agencies and debt collectors went to court early this year challenging  regulations issued by the Biden administration  that would have removed medical debt from credit reports nationwide. They argued that the administration exceeded its authority in issuing the credit reporting restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  The federal restrictions would have helped an estimated 15 million people. But the Trump administration chose not to defend the new regulations, and a federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump ruled that the regulations should be scrapped. They never went into effect.\n \n\n   \n  The Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents credit agencies and has argued that regulating medical debt should be left to the federal government, welcomed the new guidance from the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “There should be one national standard to govern how information is provided to consumer reporting agencies and what information can appear on a consumer’s credit report,” association president Dan Smith said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Broader health insurance protections could prevent more Americans from sinking into debt and depressing their credit scores.\n \n\n   \n  But millions of Americans  are expected  to lose health coverage in the coming years as a result of the tax and spending bill signed by the president in July.\n \n\n   \n  “Millions of Americans are avoiding medical care, putting off needed surgeries, skipping essential treatments,” said Allison Sesso, president and chief executive of Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that buys up and retires patients’ debts and advocates for broader patient protections.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t just a health care issue,” Sesso added. “It’s an economic crisis that’s keeping families from building wealth and fully participating in the economy. When credit scores are dinged by medical bills, everyone loses.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/democrats-leave-classified-briefing-on-us-military-strikes-unsatisfied-after-pentagon-pulls-lawyers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:39:00Z","title":"Democrats Leave Classified Briefing on US Military Strikes Unsatisfied After Trump Administration Pulls Pentagon Lawyers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democrats have expressed deep dissatisfaction with the Trump administration's decision to exclude them from a classified briefing on U.S. military strikes targeting suspected drug boats in the western hemisphere.

Jason Crow, who sits on the House Armed Services and the Intelligence committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Fuming at a separate press conference over his accusation that the White House  cut Democrats out  of a Wednesday briefing, Sen. Mark Warner had an even sharper take: “bullsh*t.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be blunt, what the administration did in the last 24 hours is corrosive, not only to our democracy, but downright dangerous for our national security,” Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration in recent weeks has accelerated its attacks against boats they allege are involved in drug trafficking. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have repeatedly criticized the administration for failing to provide them with enough information related to those strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has defended its information sharing with Congress, telling CNN earlier this week it has given  seven separate classified briefings  on the strikes to various committees. But the information that Pentagon officials have offered so far on those attacks during closed-door briefings has largely fueled more questions and concerns from Democrats about the administration’s legal justification for them – especially as only select Republicans have been allowed to see the classified legal opinion detailing that argument.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats said the information provided to them Thursday fell short of what they needed to provide proper congressional checks on the president’s war powers.\n \n\n   \n  “I sit on the Armed Services and the Intelligence Committee. Our job is to oversee the use of lethal force by our military outside of the United States, and I’m walking away without an understanding of how and why they’re making an assessment that the use of lethal force is adequate here,” Crow said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California similarly said “the level of transparency was not OK” and added that “there’s nothing that we heard in there that changes my assessment that this is completely illegal, that it is unlawful and even if Congress authorized it, it would still be illegal because there are extrajudicial killings where we have no evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  The briefers, Jacobs said, only cited Article II as the legal justification for the strikes and said they didn’t know the identities of all of the individuals involved in them. They also told lawmakers that cocaine was the only narcotic targeted in the strikes so far and claimed it is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl,” according to the congresswoman. “It was not a satisfactory answer for most of us,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the Democratic ranking members, Republican chairmen of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees attended the meeting but declined to comment to reporters afterward.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Mike Rogers, the Armed Services chairman, would only tell CNN he expects an additional briefing.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans defend need for bipartisan briefings\n \n\n   \n  Still, several Senate Republicans said Democrats should have been invited to Wednesday’s briefing on the Caribbean boat strikes, though they insisted their exclusion wasn’t malicious.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an unfortunate situation, and I wish it wouldn’t have happened this way. It did, but I’ve talked to a number of my colleagues already and told them that we still agree that this should be delivered on a bipartisan basis,” Sen. Mike Rounds, who sits on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Rounds added that his understanding was that several GOP senators had requested a further briefing on the legality of the strikes, and other Republicans, including him, also asked to be included.\n \n\n   \n  “When I got into the meeting, I realized that there were people from a lot of different committees, but I couldn’t identify the group in particular, but there were no Democrats there,” he said. “And so afterwards, we went back and followed up. The White House called us and said, ‘Yeah, this was a separate meeting. It was asked for by one of your colleagues.’ We just happen to have also been invited to it, and that is consistent with what we saw.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Kevin Cramer agreed that his Democratic colleagues should have access to the same briefings as Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that any administration should leave out any party from a briefing of that level of importance. And I think their justification — you can argue it, and no doubt people will — but I don’t think that something of that importance shouldn’t be shared. Whether it’s legal justification or if there’s — if there are details about who are on these boats and what these boats are containing, you know, the tactics, I think all of that should be available to people who oversee the Pentagon,” Cramer said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats didn’t hide their their frustration with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “It is totally unprecedented in my 15 years of service in the United States Senate that intelligence briefings on a matter of this consequence would be held for one party alone,” said an angry Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes to this administration concealing the facts and worrying about the law.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/democratic-campaign-trail-2028-hopefuls","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:43:00-04:00","title":"The 2025 Campaign Trail Becomes Popular Stop for Democrats with Eyes on 2028","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 campaign trail has become a strategic testing ground for Democratic candidates eyeing the 2028 presidential election.

October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  2025 campaign trail  has become a popular stop for potential 2028 presidential hopefuls looking to help the Democratic Party’s candidates for governor.\n \n\n   \n  Pete Buttigieg joined Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey Thursday morning to criticize President Donald Trump’s threats to cancel a major commuter rail project connecting her state and New York City. In Virginia, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona appeared with the party’s nominee Abigail Spanberger to rally Latino voters before holding a similar event with Sherrill in her state this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg and Gallego’s appearances come as the off-year and midterm elections have turned into an early testing ground for 2028 presidential hopefuls – giving them a chance to sharpen their campaign skills outside of their home states and help elevate fellow Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the high-profile Democratic surrogate work has played out in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  But the New York City mayoral race has drawn the progressive star power of hometown Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an ardent backer of Democratic nominee  Zohran Mamdani . And in California,  Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Prop 50 campaign  to push through mid-decade redistricting in his state has further propelled him into the national conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re thinking about future campaigns, it’s smart to have a strategy that’s not just about going to the primary states but also showing that you’re a team player in the Democratic Party and that your message can help turn voters out,” said Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for the Democratic Governors Association.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Buttigieg, a former transportation secretary, touted his work with Sherrill to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel project, a rail project between New Jersey and New York City that Trump said he had “terminated” earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg described the move as “mob boss politics” and criticized Sherrill’s  Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli  for not having “the backbone” to push back on the president.\n \n\n   \n  “This state needs a governor who can think for herself, and someone who will put the best interest of the state first. And there’s only one candidate who will do that,” Buttigieg said at an event with Sherrill at a Westfield, NJ, train station.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg was slated later Thursday to help turn out voters in Red Bank and raise money for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. His appearances with Sherrill came one week after he headlined an event with Spanberger and Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of his stop with Sherrill this week, Buttigieg sent an e-mail to his fundraising list saying he was “back on the campaign trail” to help candidates across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Gallego, who has said the Democratic Party needs to do more to win back Latino voters, is tapped this week with taking that pitch to Latino communities in Virginia and New Jersey, a state where the  Latino vote could be key  to picking the next governor.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, all we want is to have a chance at the American Dream, to be able to build a family here, to have a chance to continue to grow this country and the beautiful vision that everyone has,” Gallego said Thursday at a “Latinos for Spanberger” event in Alexandria, Virginia. “And this is why we as Latinos have to come out and vote today and all the way until Tuesday, because the only way we get that dream is when we have friends that care about us.”\n \n\n   \n    Big names out on the campaign trail for Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Several sitting Democratic governors potentially eyeing higher office have descended on New Jersey and Virginia to give a boost to the women they hope will join their ranks next year. That includes Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore; Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro; and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  “The big names you’re hearing in the Democratic Party are more and more governors,” said Leopold. “It’s especially helpful if you’re running for governor to have a governor campaign with you to show the executive experience and show what a governor can do.”\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker  has been a frequent surrogate for Sherrill in his home state. Other high-profile Democratic surrogates who have hit the campaign trail in New Jersey or Virginia this year include Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; California Rep. Ro Khanna and former US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, who is now a CNN commentator.\n \n\n   \n  “These are the type of leaders that are focused on the everyday problems, the everyday concerns of Americans, and that can be the type of leaders that re-earn the faith of the American people,” Beshear, vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said of Sherrill and Spanberger during a virtual event with the Democratic National Committee Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also have helped raise money for the off-year candidates. Newsom, who has said he will make a  decision about 2028  after the midterms, participated in a virtual fundraiser with Sherrill for New Jersey’s Democratic campaigns and state committee, a source familiar with the event said. Meanwhile, Pritzker has donated six-figures across the New Jersey and Virginia races, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  While 2028 hopefuls on the Democratic side have eagerly stumped during this year’s off-year elections, the Republican side has not drawn as much attention from presidential aspirants.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz joined Virginia’s Republican gubernatorial nominee  Winsome Earle-Sears  last week for a fundraiser. New Jersey’s GOP gubernatorial nominee Ciattarelli has recently campaigned with Rep. Byron Donalds, who is running for governor in Florida in 2026. Trump also held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli this month.\n \n\n   \n  Though New Jersey and Virginia have seen frequent visits from high-profile Democrats, the New York City mayoral race has not drawn as many national party figures to campaign on behalf of Mamdani, a democratic socialist.\n \n\n   \n  But  he has received a boost  from Ocasio-Cortez and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders – both popular figures with the progressive base who are able to draw large crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m talking to you, Donald Trump,” Ocasio-Cortez declared at a rally last weekend, saying that “we will work our hearts out to elect Zohran Kwame Mamdani as the next mayor of the great city of New York.”\n \n\n   \n  While each of these high-profile Democrats has taken a turn on the campaign stage, former President Barack Obama remains the party’s most sought-after surrogate. He’s taped ads for Sherrill and Spanberger and will campaign in-person for the two Democratic candidates in their states on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  But the Democratic party’s most recent leaders – former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Joe Biden – have not appeared on this year’s campaign trail as Democrats still grapple with the fallout of last year’s election.\n \n\n   \n  Harris, who has left the door open to a possible run in 2028, sent a fundraising e-mail on behalf of Sherrill this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Again and again, Mikie has shown that she is not afraid of a tough fight, and that she will stand up to anyone who attacks the rights, freedoms, or livelihoods of the people she serves,” Harris wrote. “That is exactly the kind of leadership we need right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden has not made any campaign stops since leaving office but is scheduled to appear at a political event for the Nebraska Democratic Party three days after Tuesday’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Biden was one of the Democratic Party’s most active surrogates for the midterm elections, stumping for candidates in places like Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. He launched his presidential campaign the following spring.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a new crop of Democrats is trying to chart its own path to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the start, 2025,” said Leopold. “And you’re going to see a lot more of it in 2026.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/africa/tanzania-election-protests-dar-es-salaam-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:54:00Z","title":"More protests in Dar es Salaam after chaotic Tanzanian election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a contentious general election in Tanzania on October 29, 2025, protests erupted in Dar es Salaam and other cities due to the exclusion of major opposition candidates and allegations of government repression.

Tanzania fired tear gas and gunshots on Thursday to disperse groups of protesters who returned to the streets a day after a general election marred by violent demonstrations, witnesses said.\n \n\n   \n  Protests broke out in commercial capital Dar es Salaam and other cities during the vote on Wednesday over the exclusion of President Samia Suluhu Hassan’s two biggest challengers from the presidential race, as well as what demonstrators say is increasing government  repression .\n \n\n   \n  Police ordered an overnight curfew in Dar es Salaam, a city of more than seven million people, after government offices and other buildings were set ablaze.\n \n\n   \n  Internet access, disrupted during the election, appeared to be returning intermittently on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Tito

While she indicated from the bench that she was likely to issue a ruling favorable to a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors who sued the administration earlier this week, she acknowledged that benefits, which should start being sent to recipients on November 1, will be delayed.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Talwani said she would work quickly to issue her decision later Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans receive food stamps, a critical piece of the  nation’s safety net.  The program costs roughly $8.5 billion to $9 billion a month, while the contingency fund now has about $5.3 billion in it, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which is representing USDA in the case.\n \n\n   \n  If the judge orders the government to use the emergency funds, it will take time for the US Department of Agriculture and states to get their systems up and running again, which means at least some beneficiaries will likely have to wait for the November allotment.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also unclear whether recipients will receive their full November benefits since the USDA’s contingency fund does not have enough money to cover the entire payments without drawing from other resources. But the Trump administration has shifted money to fund other priorities during the shutdown, including transferring $300 million to keep the  WIC food assistance program  for pregnant women, new moms and young children afloat for October.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the discussion during Thursday’s hearing centered around the fact that the contingency fund contains far less than what is needed to fully cover November benefits for the millions of Americans who receive them. The judge said multiple times that federal law made clear that when the government is unable to pay benefits, it should reduce what it provides, not suspend the program altogether.\n \n\n   \n  “It does seem to me really clear what Congress was trying to do,” Talwani said. “What Congress was trying to do is protect the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger, Talwani added.\n \n\n   \n  A group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC,  sued the administration on Tuesday   over the US Department of Agriculture’s recent decision to not tap into the contingency fund.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, USDA said that it was unable to use the rainy-day fund, reversing course from earlier agency guidance that said such a move was possible. In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene on an emergency basis to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  In the food stamps case, the attorneys general and governors argued the administration was violating federal law that requires the government to consistently fund the food stamps program and that its decision to not tap into the contingency fund ran afoul of federal rulemaking laws.\n \n\n   \n  “USDA suspended SNAP benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November SNAP benefits,” they wrote in the lawsuit. “Suspending SNAP benefits in these circumstances is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.\n \n\n   \n  Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information – ranging from a week before the start of the month to the first day of the month – in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to acknowledging the likely delay in benefits, the judge on Thursday also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney for Massachusetts told Talwani that it would be up to the states to figure out how to reduce payments based on the available federal funds, but an attorney representing the Trump administration pushed back strongly on that idea.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department lawyer, Jason Altabet, said that while it was up to USDA officials to make decisions on reductions in benefit amounts, the agency was extremely concerned about the prospect of having to do that work.\n \n\n   \n    Changing positions\n \n\n   \n  In its shutdown contingency plan, which has since been taken offline, USDA indicated that the contingency fund can be used for benefits in case of a lapse. The plan noted that “Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue.”\n \n\n   \n  But on October 10, the agency began raising red flags, informing states that there is  not enough money  to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues and asking them to hold off on next month’s payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins doubled down on that position the following week, telling reporters that food stamps will run dry by the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  And last week, the USDA said it  will not tap into the fund , stating in a memo that “contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January. But the agency then said it would use a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse to  cover February payments . That workaround ultimately wasn’t needed since the shutdown ended in late January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/entertainment/scream-stranger-things-trailers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:25:00Z","title":"'Scream 7' and 'Stranger Things 5' Trailers Deliver Double Dose of Scares","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Halloween Eve, 2025, trailers for 'Scream 7' and 'Stranger Things 5' were released, capitalizing on seasonal fan interest.

I thought I had died,” Abby Zwerner said Thursday, shortly before her attorneys rested their case, recounting the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner raised her hand instinctively as she realized what the student was going to do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The look on the student’s face is the large memory that I have,” Zwerner said Thursday. “It was like a very blank look, but it wasn’t a blank look at all.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN All Access has live coverage of teacher shot by student trial \n \n\n   \n  One of Zwerner’s last memories at the school the day she was shot, she said, was thinking, “I was on my way to heaven or in heaven.”\n \n\n   \n  “My next memory is I see two coworkers around me,” Zwerner said. “I process that I’m hurt, and they’re putting pressure on where I’m hurt.”\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million lawsuit against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  The civil trial offers a peek inside some of the key details that will be presented during the criminal case next month against Parker, who faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect.\n \n\n   \n  Filing charges against school officials in the aftermath of a school shooting is rare, a law professor at the University of Virginia told CNN, and this case could set a precedent for future events as US communities grapple with questions of responsibility after a school is scarred by gun violence.\n \n\n   \n  It remains an increasingly pervasive problem: As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States so far this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n    Official ignored warning signs, lawsuit alleges\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner described the consequences of the physical trauma wrought by the shooting. Because of her injury, which prompted multiple surgeries, Zwerner is unable to fully use her left hand to this day, she said. \n \n\n   \n  “Overall, I would say I do struggle with things, doing things,” she said, like opening a bag of chips and water bottles. \n \n\n   \n  She also testified to lingering emotional trauma such as being afraid to go out in public with her mother and sister and feeling distant from friends. \n \n\n   \n  “I just want to stay home,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The  lawsuit alleges  Parker ignored concerns raised by several teachers and staff members, including that the student may have had a gun in his possession hours before the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Parker is accused of ignoring “warnings from teachers and staff that students had seen the firearm” and that the student had “removed an object that was likely a firearm from his backpack before it was searched,” the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  A guidance counselor and administrator at the school said Parker also “forbade” teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his mother would pick him up soon, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was required to be accompanied by a parent at school “because of his violent tendencies.” But the day of the shooting, school administrators “allowed him to remain unaccompanied,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  During the previous school year, the boy strangled and choked a teacher and pulled up a female classmate’s dress and touched her inappropriately on the school playground, the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  Poor decisions led up to the “avoidable” shooting, a grand jury report found last April.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorney has previously not responded to CNN’s request for comment. On Thursday, during cross-examination, an attorney for Parker worked to undercut Zwerner’s claims about the shooting, limiting her willingness to go out in public.   \n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had attended concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until after her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Parker resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal was reassigned to another school. The incident also led the school board to vote out the superintendent.\n \n\n   \n    Teacher’s witnesses describe emotional toll\n \n\n   \n  The third day of testimony began with Zwerner’s attorneys calling to the stand a psychiatrist who testified Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner had overcome mental stressors in the past, Dr. Clarence Watson testified, like when she had a heavy workload in college or soon after her father’s sudden death. But the shooting was “like throwing gasoline on top of the fire,” causing her recurring nightmares.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Zwerner wiped away tears as her twin sister reflected Wednesday on the   changes she’s seen in Zwerner since the first-grade teacher was shot by her 6-year-old student more than two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s just not the person that she was,” Hannah Zwerner told the court, saying the shooting dimmed a sister who used to be a bright light.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a lot to be excited about. And she doesn’t anymore.”\n \n\n   \n    Injuries were devastating\n \n\n   \n  The chief of surgery where Zwerner was hospitalized testified Tuesday her injuries were life-threatening. Her lung collapsed and the bullet that remains inside Zwerner’s body just missed her heart, Daniel Munn said. An orthopedic trauma surgeon testified about the details of Zwerner’s devastating hand injury, her multiple surgeries and ongoing recovery.\n \n\n   \n  After two weeks in the hospital and six surgeries, Zwerner is left with a hand that will never be normal, orthopedic surgeon James Stuart told the court.\n \n\n   \n  A now-retired corporal from the Newport News Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about his response to the scene after the shooting. “We were quite taken aback. We didn’t expect to see so young a suspect,” the corporal testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s lawyers also introduced body cam footage and police scene photographs into evidence.\n \n\n   \n    School official is only defendant\n \n\n   \n  Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit. A judge previously dismissed the others, including the Newport News School Board, the district’s former superintendent and the former school principal, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  The student’s mother was  sentenced  to a total of nearly four years in prison for    child neglect and federal weapons charges.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was  not charged  with any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The gun used in the shooting was purchased by the boy’s mother, kept on the top shelf of her closet and was secured by a trigger lock, an attorney for the mother  previously told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  However, prosecutors  later said  authorities found no trigger lock and no key to a trigger lock. The boy stood on a dresser drawer and took the gun from his mother’s purse.  ﻿ He then brought the gun to school in his backpack, police said.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s mother had no criminal record and cooperated with authorities since the shooting. She  turned herself in  to police after state charges were filed  against her and was released after posting a $5,000 bond.\n \n\n   \n    Case could set precedent\n \n\n   \n  Because attempts to hold school officials criminally accountable for school shootings are rare, this case could set a precedent, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  The closest thing to something like the case against Parker is when charges were filed against the deputy who stayed outside during the mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, he said. The deputy in that case  was acquitted  on all counts against him in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  As of October 26, there have been  356 mass shootings  in the US this year, leaving  at least 300 people dead  and 1,600 injured,  according to  data from the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one that injured or killed four or more people.\n \n\n   \n  Charging school officials for neglect appears to be an “emerging strategy,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to be kind of the only strategy left that we can put responsibility on the people who provide access to guns, at least to children, at least to school children and children under 16 or 18,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the civil trial could be a “dry run” for what’s to come in the criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone on both sides the prosecution and the defense should have a very clear idea of what the evidence is going to be and what the witnesses are going to say,” the professor said.\n \n\n   \n  The cases could end up setting “a very big” precedent and lead to school officials more aware of their duties to act on any information they have about a child with a gun or who poses a danger to students and staff, Brown said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/ed-martin-doj-trump-political-prosecutions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"The Weapon of Justice: Ed Martin’s Influence at DOJ","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ed Martin, a former US Attorney for Washington, DC, has risen to significant power in the Trump Justice Department despite failing to gain Senate confirmation.

influence at DOJ \n       \n  By Katelyn  Polantz, Evan Perez, Hannah Rabinowitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Failing to win Senate approval as US Attorney for Washington, DC, has made Ed Martin a more formidable force inside the Trump Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  After three chaotic months as interim US attorney earlier this year, Justice Department officials placed Martin in the department’s headquarters in a traditionally more supervised position. Unconfirmable and intent on rewriting the consequences of the January 6 prosecutions, Martin was, as one Trump ally said, being put under more “adult supervision.”\n \n\n   \n  That move, though, didn’t appear to hold him back. Martin now wields a surprising amount of political power and four titles: Associate Deputy Attorney General, Pardon Attorney, director of the Weaponization Working Group and Special Attorney for Mortgage Fraud. He’s also become the chief enforcer of using the Justice Department to exact President Donald Trump’s personal agenda — including by playing a role behind the scenes in the recent indictments of Trump foes  James Comey  and  Letitia James,  delving into so-called “weaponization” within the federal government and Biden-era pardons, and continuing to bear down on others Trump wants to see investigated.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Martin told the Republican-led House Oversight Committee that he was working on an “ongoing investigation” of pardons and commutations during Joe Biden’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, which adds fuel to Trump’s attacks of presidential clemency given to members of the House Select Committee that investigated January 6 and others before they faced charges, recasts the traditional role of a pardon attorney in the extreme. Previously the job focused on reviewing and making recommendations to the president after prisoners petitioned for clemency. Under Martin, it’s become a much more active, politicized approach, where he is now critiquing past presidents’ clemency, a Constitutional power that has few limitations.\n \n\n   \n  “My ongoing investigation has revealed abuses of the pardon and commutation process by political actors in the Biden Administration. The use of AutoPen at the direction of staff and perhaps others is troubling,” Martin wrote to committee chairman James Comer, according to an email to obtained by CNN’s Jake Tapper. The Justice Department has previously said a president’s use of an autopen is legally sound.\n \n\n   \n  Martin’s influence also has become evident in cases where career prosecutors have balked at charging Trump political opponents and which his bosses, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, had reservations about before bringing.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, prosecutions of Comey and  James  have moved ahead over the protests of career prosecutors and even some Trump political appointees. Firings and resignations by experienced prosecutors have followed, and Martin has been in close contact with  Lindsey Halligan , whom Trump placed as the lead US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, who initiated those indictments, sources tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, Martin has turned his focus toward building his connections to other US Attorneys’ Offices, including in Atlanta, St. Louis and upstate New York, according to sources familiar with Martin’s efforts. Some of that effort may include known probes around Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor whom Trump has tried to fire, on mortgage fraud allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “Ed Martin is one of the most dangerous people in the Justice Department. He’s not a serious lawyer, but he has serious power,” said Liz Oyer, a former career Justice Department official who preceded Martin as pardon attorney. “He seemingly has the power to open criminal investigations, which is serious business. Being subject to a criminal investigation can ruin someone’s life.”\n \n\n   \n  Oyer noted that investigating Trump’s political opponents and holding the pardon post gives Martin especially unusual influence — as a political force who can both punish Trump’s enemies and reward his friends.\n \n\n   \n  His willingness to use the Justice Department to advance MAGA movement politics stands in contrast with the Justice Department norms since the Richard Nixon era. Reforms after the Watergate crisis led to a tradition under Republican and Democratic administrations to distance prosecution decisions from the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Even in the first Trump administration, attorneys general generally enforced rules limiting contact between White House officials and Justice Department employees.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has no such qualms and is known to maintain regular contact with White House officials, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  A Missouri Republican, Martin burnished his MAGA credentials following the 2021 Capital attack, becoming a vocal defender of Trump vote fraud claims in the 2020 election and of January 6 rioters — some of whom he represented as an attorney.\n \n\n   \n  As part of his so-called weaponization probe, Martin brought onto his staff former FBI agent Jared Wise, who was prosecuted for allegedly urging January 6 rioters to attack law enforcement officers, calling the officers “Nazis” and the “Gestapo.”\n \n\n   \n  Martin maintains at least two offices at the Justice Department – one in a complex north of the US Capitol where the pardon attorney office is located, the other inside the Justice Department headquarters.\n \n\n   \n  His active social media presence including a Substack blog and his support for January 6 rioters caused wary Senate Republicans to tank his nomination to lead the federal prosecutors’ office in Washington, DC, which prosecuted more than 1,000 January 6 riot defendants, in May.\n \n\n   \n  But Martin appears undaunted despite receiving cautions from top Justice officials about some of his public comments.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Martin has been posting nearly every day on social media photos of people he meets with, including right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the comedian Russel Brand, US Attorneys from outside of DC, and Trump supporters in politics from around the country.\n \n\n   \n  He also has been lobbying prosecutors in Maryland to pursue mortgage fraud allegations around Democratic California Sen.  Adam Schiff,  another one of Trump’s political opponents, who helped lead congressional investigations of him, sources say.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department and Martin didn’t comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Martin sought to flex his influence earlier this month as former New York Rep. George Santos won a sentence commutation from the president, after serving in a minimal-security federal prison camp only three months of his seven-year sentence for fraud.\n \n\n   \n  Santos for months had sought the help of intermediaries to get Trump’s attention for a pardon and Martin tried to help behind the scenes, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  After the president granted the commutation, Martin said in a post on X: “I was honored as U.S. Pardon Attorney to have played a small role” in the clemency grant, and he thanks the president for “making clemency great again.”\n \n\n   \n  “Martin has made it known that his intent with pardons is to use them to benefit people with MAGA affiliations,” Oyer said. “For Martin to have both of those roles,” of pardon attorney and prosecutor, “it shows how this department is operating a system of both punishment and reward.”\n \n\n   \n    Catching Trump’s attention\n \n\n   \n  Some of Martin’s recent campaigns have been channeled into the president’s own social media feed. For instance, with Martin as the mortgage fraud investigator, Trump lashed out at Bondi, demanding in a  remarkable Truth Social  post for the prosecution of his political enemies.\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump wrote. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Blanche has sought to bring a measure of control to Martin’s efforts, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The tension between Blanche and Martin spilled out into the public in late September, after Martin sent a letter to an FBI agent who had responded to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. Martin, in his letter, disclosed what he said was an investigation of the agent, after the agent had testified about being smeared in a conspiracy theory pushed by Jones, who gained notoriety with claims that the Sand Hook attack was staged by the FBI. The agent was awarded nearly $100 million in a case against Jones.\n \n\n   \n  Jones made Martin’s letter public, demanding responses from the FBI agent, until Blanche demanded Martin retract his requests.\n \n\n   \n  Martin then wrote to the agent’s lawyer, “I write to inform you that there is no investigation of you or your client. Because of this, I hereby withdraw my request for information from you or your former client.”\n \n\n   \n    An ally in Virginia\n \n\n   \n  But Martin’s power has accrued alongside the arrival of another former Trump adviser, Halligan, who Trump installed to run the powerful US Attorney’s Office in Alexandria, Virginia, in late September.\n \n\n   \n  While career prosecutors and top Justice officials viewed cases against Comey and James to be duds, Halligan managed to deliver the two indictments Trump publicly called for.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan replaced Erik Seibert after attorneys in the office objected to charging Comey with lying to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Both Comey and James have pleaded not guilty and are challenging the prosecutors’ handling of the cases.\n \n\n   \n  In the James investigation before she was charged, Martin took several steps that fall outside the norms of prosecutorial conduct.\n \n\n   \n  Martin this summer sent a letter to James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, suggesting that James should resign as attorney general. And he paid a visit to James’ Brooklyn  home  in August, posing for photos outside it wearing a long trench coat, accompanied by an assistant who acts as an unofficial spokesperson, unusual for a person in Martin’s position to have at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to go to the very bottom of the facts, and if somebody did something wrong, we’re not only going to hold them accountable. We’re also going to look at everything else that they’ve been doing. Because when you’re a liar, you lie not just on one thing,” Martin said on Fox News in August when asked about the mortgage investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Some senior DOJ officials were frustrated by the stunt, one source said, as they had no idea Martin would be traveling to New York.\n \n\n   \n    Attention in Maryland\n \n\n   \n  Apparently emboldened by the charging successes in Virginia, Martin’s fast-moving advocacy turned in recent weeks to Maryland’s US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The office’s US Attorney Kelly Hayes, a respected career prosecutor who worked for years out of Greenbelt, recently secured the indictment of former Trump national security adviser  John Bolton , another Trump political foe. Prosecutors accuse Bolton of keeping national security secrets in unsecured personal accounts and on printed paper after he left the government.\n \n\n   \n  Hayes’ approach, and the Bolton case itself, are viewed more seriously than the indictments and investigations of other political figures who have faced charges at Trump’s urging, several sources familiar with the case and the office have told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But the Maryland office still has a prosecutor looking into the financial records of Schiff, another Trump target, and Martin continues to push Hayes to bring an indictment against him.\n \n\n   \n  Last week after it became known Hayes’ team had doubts about the case, sources said the investigation was continuing and the Deputy Attorney General’s office may be working with Hayes, in a vote of confidence for the US Attorney in a precarious moment.\n \n\n   \n  Yet because of Martin’s pushes for prosecution in Maryland and Virginia, the districts are now buzzing with speculation Martin could end up as a prosecutor in one of the offices.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-global-tariffs-senate-rebuke","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:16:00-04:00","title":"Senate Republicans Rebuke Trump for a Third Time This Week, Voting with Democrats Against President’s Global Tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant political development, four Republican senators — Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, and Mitch McConnell — joined Democrats in voting against President Donald Trump’s global tariffs, marking the third such vote in as many days.

remains \n       \n  By Katie Hunt, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:03 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A legendary fossil housed at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh features skeletons apparently locked in prehistoric combat — an epic meeting of two of the world’s favorite dinosaurs: Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex. Or so paleontologists thought.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers who spent the past five years studying the stunning collection of bones called the “dueling dinosaurs” say they have uncovered a case of mistaken identity, determining that the small-bodied dinosaur was not a juvenile T. Rex but rather a fully grown example of a hotly debated species known as Nanotyrannus lancensis.\n \n\n   \n  “We have the growth record preserved in the microstructure of the bone, which shows that it’s an adult,” said James Napoli, a vertebrate paleontologist at Stony Brook University and coauthor of the new study published Thursday  in the journal Nature.  The discovery has triggered a rethink of many other fossils previously identified as teenage T. rex remains, Napoli added.\n \n\n   \n  While similar in appearance, the two dinosaur species would have been very different: Nanotyrannus was 18 feet long, agile and built for speed, with long legs and strong arms to grasp prey, while 42-foot-long T. rex had stocky legs and used its devastating bite to devour huge, slow-moving dinos.\n \n\n   \n  Despite its relatively diminutive size, Napoli said that Nanotyrannus had larger upper limbs than a fully grown T. rex, which had famously tiny arms. “Bones don’t shrink when animals grow so this could not have possibly become an (adult) T. rex,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The finding “flips decades of T. rex research on its head,” according to study coauthor Lindsay Zanno, associate research professor at North Carolina State University and head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.\n \n\n   \n  “A wealth of studies on the biology of T. rex over the past three decades have unknowingly mixed data from Nanotyrannus with that of T. rex. Those studies need to be reevaluated in light of this discovery,” Zanno said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The dueling dinosaurs  fossil was first discovered 2006 , exposed as sedimentary rock eroded from the Hell Creek Formation, which dates back 65.5 million years and stretches across parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.\n \n\n   \n    Mistaken identity\n \n\n   \n  Nanotyrannus lancensis, which like T. rex is part of the larger tyrannosaurid family in taxonomic classification, was first identified from a fossil unearthed in the 1940s from the same rock formation as the dueling dinosaurs.\n \n\n   \n  However, scientists later shifted the narrative and interpreted that initial find and many other small Tyrannosaur fossils uncovered in the following decades to be juvenile T. rex specimens. The idea that another species might have produced the fossils fell out of favor, though the possibility was still debated at scientific conferences and other forums.\n \n\n   \n  The new research, which examined and compared over 200 Tyrannosaur fossils, suggests that juvenile T. rex fossils were not as common in the fossil record as paleontologists previously thought. For years, the study authors reported, paleontologists have misidentified Nanotyrannus fossils as juvenile T. rex specimens and used the morphological features of the remains to  model T. rex growth and behavior .\n \n\n   \n  “What’s exciting is that this discovery opens the door to a whole series of new questions about how these different predators — one built for brute strength and one built for speed — interacted in the twilight of the dinosaurs,” Zanno said.\n \n\n   \n  The study authors said they also had identified a fossil called “Jane” as a  second species of Nanotyrannus , which they dubbed Nanotyrannus lethaeus. The name is a reference to the River Lethe, the river of forgetfulness in Greek mythology, a nod to how this dinosaur remained hidden in plain sight and “forgotten” for decades.\n \n\n   \n    Uncomfortable questions\n \n\n   \n  The finding raises “uncomfortable” questions about why a scientific consensus came together so quickly around the idea that all Nanotyrannus specimens are juvenile T. rexes, said Larry Witmer, Chang Ying-Chien Professor of Paleontology at Ohio University. Witmer didn’t take part in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Many T. rex fossils, which can sell for  tens of millions of dollars at auction , were commercially collected and are in private hands, making them difficult to study, he noted in a commentary published alongside the research.\n \n\n   \n  “This exceptionally researched study by Zanno and Napoli puts Nanotyrannus on a solid foundation,” Witmer said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the implications of the findings go beyond settling a scientific disagreement.\n \n\n   \n  “There is much more at stake here than declaring a victor in the debate, because there are literally decades of research and probably hundreds of publications based on a premise that this article overturns,” he said. “These analyses will all need revision.”\n \n\n   \n  Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology at the University of Edinburgh said the finding should prompt “a fundamental reassessment of tyrannosaur classification and evolution.”\n \n\n   \n  “For many years in my research on tyrannosaurs, I’ve considered a set of smaller skeletons found in the same rocks as the famous skeletons of huge T. rexes to be juveniles of T. rex rather than a distinctive smaller species,” Brusatte, who wasn’t involved with the new study, explained.\n \n\n   \n  “Reading this new paper, I think new evidence from this exquisite new specimen in the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences shows that I was wrong — at least in part,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  However, not every smaller tyrannosaur skeleton should be classified as Nanotyrannus, according to Brusatte. “T. rex was the size of a bus as an adult, and bones of adult T. rexes are very common across western North America, from Saskatchewan down to New Mexico,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Some of these must be juvenile T. rexes, and I think it is ultimately going to be very hard to tell apart adult or near-adult Nanotyrannus from teenage T. rex, as they were probably both very similar in size, and in their skeletal features,” he noted. “That will be the challenge for future paleontologists.”\n \n\n   \n  The evidence presented in the study that the smaller animal in the dueling dinosaurs fossil is in fact Nanotyrannus is “pretty conclusive,” according to Thomas Carr, a senior scientific advisor at the Dinosaur Discovery Museum and an associate professor of biology at Carthage College. However, fresh fossils are needed to understand the differences between Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named species of Nanotyrannus lethaeus, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Carr also said he isn’t sure about whether the fossil “Jane” should be reclassified as Nanotyrannus lethaeus, as the new research suggests. “They’ve done strong work, but we must be cautious,” said Carr, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Napoli said dueling dinosaurs, which is still partially encased in rock, has many more secrets to spill. Scientists still don’t know how the two animals died — or why they were found entangled. But the Nanotyrannus specimen is 100% complete, which is extraordinarily rare in the fossil record, Napoli noted.\n \n\n   \n  “There are some bones that are partially broken with a piece missing, but every individual bone is represented to some degree,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers hope skin or feathers might also be preserved in the sediment surrounding the remains and that there are injuries on the specimen, such as a broken finger, they haven’t yet explored.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a tremendous amount of science to do on the dueling dinosaurs,” Napoli said. “It’s an amazing fossil to work on.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/economy/xi-trump-trade-deal-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00-04:00","title":"A Trump-Xi trade deal won’t fix either country’s economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent trade agreement between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, while appearing to offer relief, is unlikely to meaningfully resolve deep economic issues in either country.

China is in a far more precarious state, mostly due to preexisting problems, but  the new trade agreement  is unlikely to move the dial much for either of the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  On the surface, the headlines coming out of the historic meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping suggest a big victory for both sides. The agreement calls for the United States to lower tariffs on China by 10%, bringing the effective rate on Chinese exports down to 47%; and for China to delay export controls on rare earths and increase purchases of American soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  Such measures might alleviate some of the pain businesses and consumers have felt since Trump returned to office. However, it’s going to take a lot more to address the wounds that have been festering.\n \n\n   \n    Too little, too late?\n \n\n   \n  For one particular part of the American economy that’s been hurting the most from the resurgent trade war with China, the agreement may be coming too late.\n \n\n   \n  American soybean farmers  have been reeling  from China’s effective embargo on the commodity that began in May, when higher tariffs went into place. Up until this week, China hadn’t purchased any American soybeans, the top agricultural export for the US. China has historically been the largest export market for American soybeans, so the embargo has significantly depressed American soybean prices for the past few months.\n \n\n   \n  And even though Trump said China will buy “tremendous amounts” of soybeans, with  peak harvest season already in full swing , many US farmers may have already sold crop yields at lower prices.\n \n\n   \n    No quick fix in sight for the US job market\n \n\n   \n  Trump inherited a labor market that was already weakening, and the latest data shows that hiring  slowed to a crawl in recent months .\n \n\n   \n  His aggressive and unpredictable tariffs have only exacerbated that, as businesses have become hesitant to hire more workers due to uncertainty. Increasingly, US companies are now laying off workers, too. For the first time in years, there are more people unemployed than jobs available, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n \n\n   \n  Advances in artificial intelligence are also playing in to some layoffs, as highlighted by  Amazon’s massive job cuts  this week. And while rate cuts have traditionally been the Federal Reserve’s primary tool to support the labor market, central bankers say AI may already have caused systemic damage that can’t be fixed through monetary policy.\n \n\n   \n  Fed Governor Christopher Waller noted in recent remarks that even over a longer horizon, “if AI constitutes a structural shift in the demand for labor, monetary policy will not be an effective tool.”\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, there are growing concerns that lower rates could do more harm than good, pushing up inflation at a time when goods and services are already  more expensive . Some of that inflation is attributable to higher tariffs, and some is from tighter immigration controls that have cut back on the supply of workers in areas like child care and farming.\n \n\n   \n    China’s cocktail of economic woes\n \n\n   \n  For China, while its exports have shown remarkable resilience this year in the face of Trump’s global tariff offensive, its longstanding domestic economic woes have persisted to the point where there are even fewer immediate benefits of a trade deal compared to the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Chief among the factors clouding China’s economic outlook are a prolonged property downturn, persisting deflation, dampened consumer confidence and high youth unemployment.\n \n\n   \n  “Beyond a cyclical impulse, it’s hard to see today’s revised trade terms as materially shifting China’s more structural challenges at home, where we think tariffs are, if anything, fading in macro relevance,” Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at research firm Oxford Economics, said in a note on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  She added that the fentanyl-related tariff reduction as part of the Thursday deal could at best add a “marginal” 0.2% upside to China’s growth forecast next year.\n \n\n   \n  Recent economic data from China continues to paint a gloomy picture. In September, the decline in China’s factory-gate prices, a gauge of deflation, extended into the 36th straight month, though the drop has narrowed following Beijing’s attempt in recent months to rein in price competition in certain sectors. China’s much-touted electric vehicle industry, for example, has been embroiled in a relentless race to the bottom, partly due to excess capacity.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also not helping that consumer demand is on the decline, as evidenced by the pace of retail sales slowing to a 10-month low at 3% in September compared with a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the mix of challenges, China’s new home prices sank in September at their fastest pace in 11 months, despite traditionally being a peak season for property spending. The protracted slump, which  began with developers’ debt defaults in 2021 , is expected to continue weighing on consumer sentiment.\n \n\n   \n    Not a done deal\n \n\n   \n  The agreement Trump and Xi reached Thursday can merely be thought of as a rough draft — nothing has been signed. It’ll likely take several more meetings between American and Chinese counterparts to nail down a firmer agreement that eventually becomes a signed deal. Or it may not even get to that point at all.\n \n\n   \n  For now, though, both economies can take some solace in the fact that Trump’s threat of an additional 100% tariff on Chinese exports, which Beijing almost certainly would have retaliated against, is off the table.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/federal-judge-blocks-asylum-application-fee","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:10:00-04:00","title":"Federal judge halts asylum application fee","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Maryland has temporarily blocked the enforcement of a $100 annual asylum application fee introduced under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, citing confusion and inconsistent guidance from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge in Maryland on Thursday temporarily paused the government’s rollout of a new annual asylum application fee, citing confusion and inconsistent policies between federal agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Stephanie Gallagher said two agencies, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Executive Office for Immigration Review, acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” by issuing conflicting guidance on how and when asylum seekers must pay the $100 annual fee created under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\n \n\n   \n  Gallagher found that the lack of coordination between the two agencies had caused “significant confusion” and even led to some asylum seekers being ordered removed before any mechanism to pay the fee existed. She temporarily stayed both agencies’ policies, blocking enforcement of the annual fee nationwide, until they issue clear, uniform guidance.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants have not resolved the inconsistency between the two agencies’ policies,” Gallagher wrote, adding that the government’s conflicting rules created “irreparable harm” for asylum applicants.\n \n\n   \n  The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP) filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maryland accusing the government of unlawfully applying a new annual asylum fee to people who filed their cases before the law took effect.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed on July 4, asylum applicants are required to pay the $100 fee each year their case remains pending.\n \n\n   \n  Previous to the legislation, there was no fee required when applying for asylum.\n \n\n   \n  The US Citizenship and Immigration Services began sending notices of the new fee on October 1, giving applicants a 30-day window to pay the fee —meaning the fee will start being due as early as October 31.\n \n\n   \n  ASAP says the rollout has caused panic and confusion among asylum seekers. One member, a man from Russia who applied in 2022, told the group he’s been “very worried” because he hasn’t received any instructions from the government on how or when to pay, according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, some applicants do not have the financial means to pay the fee, plaintiffs say.\n \n\n   \n  “They would have to choose between feeding their families or paying the fee,” Susan Pelletier, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said during Tuesday’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit includes stories of people who say they’ve been impacted by the fees. A woman from Honduras says she fears she’ll face deportation over a fee she can’t afford and has no way to pay.\n \n\n   \n  Another asylum seeker from Nigeria says he only learned about the new rule from social media and worries missing a payment could jeopardize his case.\n \n\n   \n  In response to ASAP’s lawsuit, the Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, has established a payment portal that allows asylum seekers to pay the annual asylum fee.\n \n\n   \n  EOIR has also stated that it will provide notice to individuals who are subject to the new annual fee and credit any payments made through other existing systems.\n \n\n   \n  ASAP argues that USCIS and EOIR are retroactively applying the new annual asylum fee and providing contradictory information — and even set conflicting deadlines. In at least one case, the lawsuit says an immigration judge rejected an asylum application and ordered a removal for nonpayment, despite there being no mechanism to pay the fee at the time.\n \n\n   \n  During a hearing on Tuesday, Gallagher, an Obama appointee, pressed Department of Justice attorney Zareen Iqbal on whether the asylum application fee was being applied retroactively. Gallagher also noted that many applicants have already been waiting years for a decision on their cases.\n \n\n   \n  Iqbal responded that the policy was not being applied retroactively, explaining that it was intended to help address the high volume of asylum cases that have been pending for years. She compared the fee to a property tax — a recurring payment meant to sustain the system rather than penalize past applicants.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department acknowledged that some applicants have faced difficulties following the announcement of the new fee. Iqbal told the court she would reach out to the plaintiffs and USCIS to help resolve the issue.\n \n\n   \n  The judge on Thursday said she would quickly entertain a motion to lift the stay on the fee once agencies enacted “uniform policies providing asylum applicants with fair notice of the applicable fee deadline, the mechanism for payment, and the adverse consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/cte-gene-damage-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:18:00Z","title":"Hidden genetic damage is part of CTE, too, study finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in the journal Science reveals that chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease linked to repeated head trauma in contact sports and military veterans, involves hidden genetic damage in brain cells — particularly in the prefrontal cortex — that resembles the damage seen in Alzheimer’s disease.

The damage was so extensive that it was the equivalent of hundreds of years of aging.\n \n\n   \n  CTE typically develops years after someone has received repeated blows to the head. Symptoms can include memory loss, impulse control problems, anxiety, depression and anger issues. It’s most often seen in people who play sports like football, hockey and soccer, but it’s also been detected in the brains of soldiers who have been injured in explosions and in some people who experienced domestic violence.\n \n\n   \n  The disease was first identified nearly 100 years ago in boxers – at the time, scientists called it  “punch-drunk syndrome”  – but there’s still much that experts don’t know about CTE. Not everyone with repeated head trauma develops the condition, and scientists don’t totally understand why or even how head trauma can lead to this disease.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Chris Walsh, co-author of the  study published Thursday  in the journal Science, says there are still people who deny that CTE is even a disease. The latest research, he said, should change naysayers’ minds.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel like this study helps establish that CTE is something distinct from just repetitive head trauma. It represents a more gradually developing pathological process and is a well-defined entity,” said Walsh, who is chief of the Division of Genetics and Genomics at Boston Children’s Hospital and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.” We suspect it involves immune activation in a way similar to Alzheimer’s disease.”\n \n\n   \n  At this point, scientists don’t have a simple blood test or scan that can detect CTE   in a living person. The only way to make  a definitive diagnosis  is to take thin slices of the brain after the person’s death and use a microscope to look for an abnormal accumulation of tau, a protein that stabilizes certain elements of the brain. Too much tau can damage blood vessels and brain cells, and this buildup is also a hallmark   of Alzheimer’s.\n \n\n   \n  The brain is made up of a mosaic of cells that each have their own genome. Every time a stem cell divides, it accumulates mutations. The new study used sequencing and amplification technology only recently made available to look at the genes of single cells in hundreds of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain used for decision-making and other thinking skills.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers compared the results from four groups: 15 people who had repeated hits to the brain and were diagnosed with CTE; four people who had repeated head injuries but hadn’t developed CTE; 19 people without a history of head injuries or signs of CTE; and seven people who had Alzheimer’s.\n \n\n   \n  Among the people with CTE, the cells showed genomic damage that looked similar to the brains of people who had Alzheimer’s. The people who had repeated brain trauma but were not diagnosed with CTE did not have the same kind of damage.\n \n\n   \n  “Cells carry a bar code of their whole developmental history, including reflecting environmental influences, and that’s what’s happening in CTE,” Walsh explained. “The abnormal environment created by the repeated trauma damages the genomes of the cells.”\n \n\n   \n  With better understanding of the mechanisms that cause CTE, Walsh hopes the work can eventually lead to developing treatments. Because brain damage with CTE looks similar to Alzheimers, it may even be possible to use therapies for CTE patients that helped people with Alzheimer’s, but much more research will be needed before that could happen.\n \n\n   \n  The new study builds on recent research indicating that brain damage from repeated blows to the head can show up much earlier than the excessive tau markers that are seen with CTE become clear.\n \n\n   \n  A  2023 study  showed that the brain’s immune cells were increasingly activated in proportion to the number of years an athlete played contact sports, suggesting that early cellular damage may be setting the stage for the disease to progress.\n \n\n   \n  A  2020 study  also found that the risk of CTE doubles for every 2.6 years spent playing football. The condition has been reported in people as young as 17, meaning by the time a football player goes pro, they have experienced hundreds of thousands of hits to the head, and that damage seems to be adding up.\n \n\n   \n  The NFL has implemented several rule and equipment changes to reduce the number of head injuries, and the number of concussions has declined, with data from the  2024 season  showing the lowest number of concussions since tracking began in 2015.   Other sports leagues including the NHL, MLS and the English Premier League have also made changes to reduce the number of concussions among their playeres.\n \n\n   \n  But experts say it’s not just concussions that are the problem; any hit to the head can cause damage. Some suggest that if children really want to play football, their parents might skip early leagues, which can start as early as age 5, and instead wait until children turn 14 or 18 to let them play tackle football. The American Youth Soccer Organization doesn’t recommend heading the ball before the age of 10, and coaches are not encouraged to teach or practice heading at early ages.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/middleeast/palestinian-american-teenager-remains-in-israeli-jail-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:36:00-04:00","title":"Palestinian American teenager to remain in Israeli jail despite growing pressure in Congress for his release","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American from Palm Bay, Florida, has been detained in Israeli prisons without trial since February 2025 for allegedly throwing rocks at Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.

He also dared — despite punitive anti-literacy laws for enslaved people in the state — to etch short sayings or poems on the jars, making them powerful acts of resistance. Some inscriptions boast of the jar’s intended contents or enormous capacity; others remark more poignantly on his own life or working conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The “Poem Jar,” which the MFA originally bought in 1997 from a dealer in South Carolina, features a couplet that hints at Drake’s financial exploitation. The inscription reads: “I made this Jar = for cash/Though its called Lucre trash.” Currently in a gallery for self-taught and outsider art at the museum, it will assume a more prominent spot at the entrance of the Art of Americas wing once renovated in June 2026. (The jar that Drake’s family now owns has a signature and date but no writing.)\n \n\n   \n  Another jar made the same year, 1857, has a particularly wrenching inscription in light of Drake’s forced separation from a woman believed to be his wife and her two sons. That vessel, at the Greenville County Museum of Art in South Carolina, reads: “I wonder where is all my relation.”\n \n\n   \n  One of Drake’s great-great-great-great grandsons, the children’s book author and producer Yaba Baker, said he feels the restitution process offers one answer to that question. “It’s been exciting, overwhelming and feels full circle,” he said in a video call. He praised the MFA for “showing integrity and leadership” in “allowing us to connect to Dave’s legacy,” noting that “to go from being slaves to having a family of engineers and doctors and people in executive positions is a testament to Dave’s legacy in a different way.”\n \n\n   \n  These descendants began talking about getting involved in Drake’s legacy in 2022, upon the opening of “Hear Me Now: The Black Potters of Old Edgefield, South Carolina,” an exhibition jointly organized by the MFA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The family soon hired Fatheree, fresh from his win in the  Bruce’s Beach  land reparation case. Earlier this year they established the David Drake Legacy Trust, governed by five of the oldest heirs.\n \n\n   \n  So far there are about 15 family members involved, according to Fatheree, but they have created a website so that other descendants of Drake can be identified and join the efforts — what Fatheree calls “a big tent approach.”\n \n\n   \n  The initiative’s repercussions could be widespread. There are thought to be around 250  pots by Drake still in existence, and over the past five years the market for his work has exploded, driven mainly by American museums competing for pieces in the hopes of telling a more complex story about the history of slavery in the US. Several have paid six figures for his work, and in 2021 the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas paid a record-setting $1.56 million for a 25-gallon stoneware jar at auction.\n \n\n   \n  Other museums that own Drake’s work include the Met, the Philadelphia Art Museum, the De Young Museum in San Francisco, the Art Institute of Chicago, Harvard Art Museums, the St Louis Art Museum and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC, as well as smaller venues in the American South.\n \n\n   \n  Fatheree confirmed he has begun to reach out to some of these other art institutions on behalf of the family. “Our approach has been one of collaboration and invitation. I am not a litigator; we did not go to the museum and file a lawsuit (or) threaten to sue them. But our hope and frankly our expectation is that other institutions” — and private collectors of Drake’s work, he added — “will follow the Boston museum’s lead here.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is not just an opportunity for museums to be on the right side of history,” he said. “It’s an opportunity for museums to rewrite history and think not just about ownership and stewardship, but think about stewardship and justice.”\n \n\n   \n   Read more stories from The Art Newspaper  here .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/football-nfl-week-9-preview-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:55:00-04:00","title":"Lamar Jackson is back and the Chiefs visit the Bills: Five things to know about Week 9 in the NFL","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Week 9 of the 2025 NFL season features several high-stakes matchups, including Lamar Jackson’s return to action with the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins, a renewed Chiefs-Bills quarterback rivalry with Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen, and a low-scoring defensive battle between the Denver Broncos and Houston Texans.

the Chiefs visit the Bills: Five things to know about Week 9 in the NFL \n       \n  By Andy Scholes, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:55 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hard to believe we’ve already reached the halfway mark of the  NFL season . Week 9 brings the return of Lamar Jackson, another Mahomes–Allen duel, and hopefully a few games that actually keep us on the edge of our seats. Here are five things to know about Week 9:\n \n\n   \n    Lamar’s finally back\n \n\n   \n  Let’s try this again. Baltimore Ravens quarterback  Lamar Jackson  is set to start Thursday night in Miami against the Dolphins.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson practiced last week, and many expected him to suit up against the Chicago Bears, but the team opted to give his hamstring one more week to heal. Jackson now says he’s “100 percent healthy,” and the Ravens are banking on that being true.\n \n\n   \n  At 2-5, Baltimore is in dangerous territory – only two teams in NFL history have reached the postseason after starting 2-6. After their slow start, Jackson and the Ravens have almost no margin for error the rest of the way.\n \n\n   \n     Chiefs-Bills showdown \n \n\n   \n  No matchup in football has delivered more drama over the past five seasons than the  Kansas City Chiefs  vs. the Buffalo Bills. Sunday’s clash will mark the 10th meeting in six years between Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. It’s become must-see TV anytime these two square off and is undoubtably the league’s best quarterback rivalry.\n \n\n   \n  Allen owns a 4-1 record against Mahomes in the regular season, but Mahomes is undefeated where it counts – he’s 4-0 in the postseason. After a sluggish start, Kansas City’s offense is back in sync, averaging 30.8 points over its last five games, fourth best in the NFL.\n \n\n   \n  Buffalo’s defense dominated in last week’s 40-9 rout of the Carolina Panthers but suffered another setback,  losing Ed Oliver  to a torn bicep. Will we get another epic shootout? This latest installment of Mahomes vs. Allen headlines Sunday’s CBS slate, kicking off at 4:25 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n     Can we get a close game, please? \n \n\n   \n  Here’s hoping Chiefs-Bills gives us a thriller because  Week 8 was a snooze fest .\n \n\n   \n  It was the first NFL Sunday since 1970 with one or fewer games decided by single digits (with a minimum eight games). The lone nail-biter came in the New York Jets’ 39-38 comeback win over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n \n\n   \n  Week 9 features more big spreads, but in the NFL, these things tend to even out. Here’s to some games that actually go down to the wire.\n \n\n   \n     Don’t expect points in Houston \n \n\n   \n  If you like fireworks and 40-point shootouts, you might want to skip the Denver Broncos going to Houston to play the Texans.\n \n\n   \n  Both defenses are elite. Houston leads the NFL in yards allowed (266.9) and points allowed (14.7) per game. Denver, meanwhile, tops the league in sacks with 36. The over/under is set at just 39.5 – one of the lowest totals all season.\n \n\n   \n  The Texans, sitting at 3-4, can’t afford many more losses if they hope to chase down the 7-1 Colts in the AFC South.\n \n\n   \n     Kyler owns Arlington \n \n\n   \n  Arizona Cardinals QB Kyler Murray is officially questionable for Monday night’s showdown with the Dallas Cowboys because of a foot sprain, but don’t expect him to sit this one out – AT&T Stadium is basically his personal playground.\n \n\n   \n  Murray has never lost there – 5-0 in high school at Allen High (with three state titles), 1-0 at Oklahoma (Big 12 Championship) and 2-0 as a pro against Dallas.\n \n\n   \n  The stakes are high again. At 2-5, the Cardinals are clinging to postseason hopes. Fall to 2-6, and those hopes all but disappear.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/milorad-dodik-sanctions-trump-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00-04:00","title":"US lifts sanctions on Putin-backed Bosnian Serb strongman after Trump allies’ lobbying","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has lifted sanctions on Milorad Dodik, the long-time leader of Republika Srpska in Bosnia, following a months-long lobbying campaign by allies of Donald Trump.

\nUpdated: \n        12:04 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has lifted sanctions on a kleptocratic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was removed this month as president of the Serb territory within Bosnia and Herzegovina for chipping away at the US-brokered peace deal that ended bloody ethnic violence in the Balkans in the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  The waiving of sanctions on  Milorad Dodik  followed a months-long lobbying effort by allies of Donald Trump, which painted the Serb nationalist leader as a defender of “Christian values” in a country with a large Muslim population, and a victim of the sort of “lawfare” waged against the US president.\n \n\n   \n  Dodik had been sanctioned by the US for flouting the Dayton Peace Agreement, which was painstakingly thrashed out in Ohio in 1995 to end the Bosnian War. While the agreement stopped the bloodshed, it carved Bosnia into two entities: the Federation, where Bosnian Muslims share power with Croats, and the Serb-majority Republika Srpska.\n \n\n   \n  Over 20 years in and around power in Srpska, Dodik routinely threatened to split from Bosnia and “reunite” with Serbia. He has halted Bosnia’s integration into Europe by stoking ethnic tensions, often meets with Putin in Russia and has cultivated what the US Treasury Department previously called a “corrupt patronage network.”\n \n\n   \n  Bosnians had recently begun to imagine a post-Dodik future, after the longtime leader was convicted by a federal Bosnian court of undermining the Dayton agreement, banned from holding political office and stripped of his post as president. But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump’s Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “What sort of message does this send – that if you have the right connections and the right lobbyists, you can be removed from the sanctions list? It’s setting a negative precedent,” Andi Hoxhaj, a Balkan expert at King’s College London, told CNN. Coming three weeks before Dayton’s 30th anniversary, he said the timing of the Trump administration’s decision was especially dispiriting.\n \n\n   \n  The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska’s National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska’s installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Dodik hailed Trump and his allies for waiving the sanctions against him, saying the decision corrected “a grave injustice” inflicted upon Srpska “by the Obama and Biden administrations.” What Dodik failed to mention, however, is that he was also sanctioned by the Trump administration in  July 2017  for obstructing the Dayton agreement. The Biden administration imposed fresh sanctions on him in 2022 and again in early 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Dodik began to court Trump before the 2024 election, when the president was facing dozens of criminal charges. “America needs you, but the rest of the world as well!” Dodik wrote to Trump in September that year, following the second assassination attempt against him.\n \n\n   \n  Since Trump’s return to the White House, Dodik’s overtures have been amplified by several allies of the president. Rod Blagojevich – the former Illinois governor who spent eight years in prison on corruption charges before being pardoned by Trump in February – has posted in support of Dodik for months.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on Wednesday thanking Trump for waiving the sanctions on Dodik, Blagojevich signed off: “This material is distributed by RRB Strategies LLC on behalf of the Republic of Srpska.  Additional information is available at the Department of Justice, Washington, DC.”\n \n\n   \n  Filings to the Justice Department show RRB Strategies, Blagojevich’s firm, signed a  contract  with the Srpska government in March, agreeing to “lobby state representatives to prevent what is perceived as a witch hunt against Srpska officials” and “seek the lifting of sanctions” against them. The value of that contract was redacted.\n \n\n   \n  Marc Zell, another lobbyist, also signed a  contract  with the Srpska government in December 2024 worth $1 million for one year’s work, plus a bonus if Zell’s firm successfully brought about the removal of sanctions on Dodik and his allies, according to documents also filed with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agents Registration Act website. In an email, Zell told CNN that the bonus fee provision was canceled in accordance with US law.\n \n\n   \n  This month, prominent MAGA figures joined the chorus of Trump allies championing Dodik’s cause. Laura Loomer, the far-right influencer with a direct line to the president,  said  Dodik’s removal as president of Srpska was “the latest example of the brazen assault against Trump-like leaders across the world.” She claimed Dodik – a “Christian” leader – was “enduring ruthless political attacks from a coalition of Muslims and globalists.”\n \n\n   \n  Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser,  called  for Trump to “embrace” Dodik, and for the US to join forces with Srpska to defeat globalists “who seek all of our demise.”\n \n\n   \n  Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and Trump’s one-time personal attorney, visited Srpska in February and hosted Dodik on his podcast, displaying “Make Srpska Great Again” hats alongside Trump’s famous MAGA hats.\n \n\n   \n  Hoxhaj, the Balkan expert, said Dodik will use the sanctions relief to claim “to his people and to the public that he has been vindicated by the US, and that what was done to him was unjust.”\n \n\n   \n  US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, denounced the lifting of sanctions as “reckless and premature.”\n \n\n   \n  “Dodik has undermined the Dayton Peace Agreement, cozied up to Putin and profited from corruption – hardly grounds for relief,” she said. “The American people deserve answers.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/sudan-massacres-rsf-rebels-darfur-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:17:00-13:17","title":"Rebels Accused of Massacring Hundreds in Sudanese City as Videos and Satellite Images Reveal Atrocities in El Fasher","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, reports of mass atrocities emerged in El Fasher, Sudan, where the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took control after the Sudanese military's withdrawal.

Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:17 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An elderly man sits on the floor, dozens of bodies lying around him, before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)  took over the city  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”\n \n\n   \n  Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.\n \n\n   \n  Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s  withdrawal from El Fasher  earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.\n \n\n   \n  RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration,  accused the RSF of committing genocide  against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.\n \n\n   \n  One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.\n \n\n   \n  The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.\n \n\n   \n  Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.\n \n\n   \n  Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.\n \n\n   \n  Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.\n \n\n   \n  Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.\n \n\n   \n  The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.\n \n\n   \n  “So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.\n \n\n   \n  Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”\n \n\n   \n  “(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.\n \n\n   \n  “On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.\n \n\n   \n  “All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the  Russian paramilitary group Wagner .\n \n\n   \n  The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”\n \n\n   \n    Fears for the missing men\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”\n \n\n   \n  Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”\n \n\n   \n  “Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.\n \n\n   \n  “The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.\n \n\n   \n  He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.\n \n\n   \n  The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.\n \n\n   \n  As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.\n \n\n   \n  Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-diary-ceo-interview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00-04:00","title":"Kamala Harris opens up about ‘complicated’ relationship with Biden, including when he ‘greatly disappointed’ her","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris opens up about a strained and 'complicated' relationship with former President Joe Biden, citing a phone call before her debate with Donald Trump where Biden claimed people were criticizing her due to his own criticisms—framing it as self-centered and unnecessary.

But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:44 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all. It’s become  so  ubiquitous that Dictionary.com  named  it the word of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/europe/dutch-election-poll-d66-party-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:08:00-04:00","title":"Dutch Centrist Jetten Confident of Forming Government After Far Right’s Election Setback","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the Dutch parliamentary election, Rob Jetten of the centrist D66 party is confident of forming a new government after a significant surge in support, tripling its seat count to 26, while Geert Wilders’ far-right PVV suffered a major loss, dropping over a quarter of its seats and now tied at 26.

We will do everything we can to prevent that,” he said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Counting of ballots was still under way, but with 98.8% of votes accounted for it was not expected to change the fact that the two biggest parties are tied for the top spot.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/entertainment/rap-falls-out-top-40","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:19:00-04:00","title":"Are We Living Through a Rap Drought?

The Billboard charts suggest we are \n       \n  By Lisa Respers France, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:19 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It feels like the Billboard charts could use a good rap beef right about now.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because, according to the publication, for the first time since 1990, there is no hip hop in the Top 40 of the Billboard 100 chart.\n \n\n   \n  “With Kendrick Lamar and SZA’s 13-week Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 ‘Luther’ falling off the Hot 100 dated Oct. 25, 2025, there were officially no rap songs in the chart’s top 40 last week,”  Billboard reported. \n \n\n   \n  The last time that happened was the week of February 2, 1990, “when the top-ranking rap song was Biz Markie’s eventual top 10 hit ‘Just a Friend,’ which had just climbed to No. 41 on the chart.”\n \n\n   \n  The following week, that song shot to the number 29 slot, “starting a Hot 100 streak of rap songs in the top 40 that would last for the next 35 years, eight months and three weeks.”\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, rap songs currently down lower on the Hot 100 list.\n \n\n   \n  YoungBoy Never Broke Again’s “Shot Callin,” came in at number 44 followed by Cardi B’s “Safe” (featuring Kehlani) and BigXthaPlug’s “Hell at Night” (featuring Ella Langley) at 48 and 49, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  So is hip hop declining or nah?\n \n\n   \n  Billboard reports that “the lack of rap songs in the Hot 100’s top 40 is the latest sign of a recent dip in rap’s commercial dominance,” while also pointing out that they made a rule change that contributed to the recent Lamar and SZA collab dropping out of the top.\n \n\n   \n  “For the chart dated Oct. 25, descending songs were deemed recurrent and removed from the chart if they had exceeded certain durations on the chart while also falling below certain updated chart thresholds — for instance, if they had fallen below No. 25 after spending over 26 weeks on the chart,” the publication explained. “That particular change resulted in the departure of ‘Luther,’ which had fallen to No. 38 on the previous week’s Hot 100 in its 46th week on the listing.”\n \n\n   \n  Lamar’s latest album, 2024’s “GNX,” was bolstered by  his now legendary beef  with fellow rapper and former collaborator, Drake.\n \n\n   \n  The hip-hop superstar  won five Grammys  in February, two of them in major categories for his hit “Not Like Us,” a diss track of Drake.\n \n\n   \n   Drake filed suit against his own record label,  UMG Recordings, Inc. The Canadian rapper and actor’s claim was that the label participated in defaming him by publishing and promoting the song.\n \n\n   \n  Lamar was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, and it  was recently dismissed by a federal judge.  This week, though, the beef goes on, because Drake’s attorneys  made it known  they would file an appeal.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/nuclear-weapons-testing-trump-china-russia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:35:00-10:35","title":"Trump Instructs Pentagon to Start Testing Nuclear Weapons on an Equal Basis with Russia and China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has announced a directive to the Pentagon to resume testing U.S. nuclear weapons on an equal basis with Russia and China, a move that marks a dramatic reversal of the 1992 nuclear testing moratorium.

Simone McCarthy, Brad Lendon, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:35 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed to begin testing US nuclear weapons “on an equal basis” with Russia and China, heralding a potentially major shift in decades of US policy at a time of growing tensions between the world’s nuclear-armed superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made the announcement moments before his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, for what had been billed as make-or-break talks intended to restore stability after almost a year of trade and economic turmoil.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post  on social media Trump said, “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China as “a distant third” but catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House and Department of Defense for comment.\n \n\n   \n  It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to a nuclear weapons test, or  a test of a nuclear-capable weapons system . Not since the 1990s has one of the world’s three major military powers conducted a nuclear weapons test, with China having conducted its last known test in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  The US last conducted a nuclear test in 1992, when it began a voluntary moratorium on such explosive testing. It’s also not clear how quickly it could do so again, with an August report from the Congressional Research Service saying it would take 24 to 36 months for the US to test a nuclear weapon after the president gives the order.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s apparent policy pivot comes at a fractious time in global geopolitics, when a growing great power rivalry between the US and China has deep echoes of the Cold War era. Meanwhile, Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine raises the risk of a broader confrontation between Moscow and the West.\n \n\n   \n  Washington has been watching closely as both China and Russia continue to develop and test advanced weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week said that the country had tested a new nuclear-capable Burevestnik cruise missile and a nuclear-powered torpedo, known as the Poseidon, which the Russian leader boasted was without rival, according to Russian state media.\n \n\n   \n  Russia, with some 6,000 warheads, and the United States with nearly that many, account for 90% of the world’s arsenal,  according to  the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia would “act accordingly” if any country withdraws from the moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  “There is indeed an ongoing (nuclear testing) moratorium,” Peskov told reporters Thursday, adding that he was unaware of any nuclear tests being conducted by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump mentioned that other countries were allegedly testing nuclear weapons. Up until now, we have not known that anyone was testing. And if the reference was to the (nuclear-powered) Burevestnik (cruise missile) test, that is by no means a nuclear test,” Peskov said.\n \n\n   \n  “All countries are developing their defense systems,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  China is also believed to be rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and may have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade, according to a Pentagon report.\n \n\n   \n  China has constructed at least three complexes for launching ballistic missiles in recent years,  according to the Federation of American Scientists , and it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  At  a military parade  in Beijing in September, China showed off its nuclear triad – systems that can launch nuclear-capable missiles by land, sea and air – for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  When asked by a reporter later Thursday why he decided to announce the US nuclear testing plans right before his meeting with Xi, Trump said “it had to do with others.”\n \n\n   \n  “They seem to all be nuclear testing,” Trump said, speaking from Air Force One. “We halted (testing) many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”\n \n\n   \n  The US too has recently tested nuclear-capable weaponry, with the US Navy in September conducting four tests of its submarine-launched Trident missiles.\n \n\n   \n    A new arms race?\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments come as he concludes a trip that began with the US president touting his peace-making abilities in Malaysia, where he joined a signing ceremony for a peace accord on Thailand and Cambodia’s border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The US president has billed himself as a “peacemaker” and contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, while leaning into a “peace through strength” for the US military.\n \n\n   \n  But the latest remarks, if operationalized, have the potential to significantly change the status quo of nuclear testing should American rivals move to mirror the US.\n \n\n   \n  “If by testing he means nuclear explosive testing, that would be reckless, probably not possible for 18 months, would cost money that Congress would have to approve,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Kristensen warned it would “most certainly” encourages countries like Russia, China, India and Pakistan to resume their own tests. “Unlike the United States, all these countries would have much to gain by restarting nuclear testing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  When asked Thursday whether the world was entering a “more risky environment” on nuclear issues, Trump maintained his goal was de-escalation.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to see a denuclearization,” he said, pointing to the arsenals of the US, Russia and China. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday said China hoped the US would also uphold “its commitment to suspend nuclear testing, and take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, and maintain global strategic harmony and stability.”\n \n\n   \n  The timing of Trump’s announcement is also significant for its potential implications on regional security in Asia, a region with numerous nuclear powers, including rival nations India and Pakistan, as well as North Korea, which analysts have warned in recent years could be preparing for a new nuclear test.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea is responsible for the world’s most recent nuclear test in 2017– and all tests that have taken place in the 21st century. Only three countries – India, Pakistan and North Korea have tested nuclear weapons since a 1996 test ban treaty, according to the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  After testing cruise missiles earlier this week, Pyongyang said that it is taking steps to toughen its “nuclear combat posture” – a line not out of step with numerous bellicose statements from the country that has resisted calls to give up its nuclear arsenal.\n \n\n   \n  There have been signs that a new era of nuclear testing may be in the offing.  CNN reported in 2023  that the US, Russia and China had all built new facilities and dug new tunnels at their nuclear test sites in recent years, according to satellite imagery.\n \n\n   \n  “There are really a lot of hints that we’re seeing that suggest Russia, China and the United States might resume nuclear testing,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/white-house-ballroom-east-wing-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:03:00-04:00","title":"The White House ballroom saga could be worse for Trump than he realizes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's decision to demolish the East Wing of the White House and build a 90,000-square-foot privately funded ballroom has generated significant public backlash.

30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s White House ballroom saga last week followed a familiar Trump-era arc: A bunch of the president’s critics sounded the alarm about his latest provocation – in this case, the sudden and surprising demolition of the East Wing – and a bunch of other people questioned what the big deal was.\n \n\n   \n  He’s just building a ballroom, after all. And the White House kind of needed a ballroom!\n \n\n   \n  “Of all the reasons to criticize President Trump, this must count as the silliest,” the often-Trump-skeptical  National Review wrote .\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Post editorial board said Trump was characteristically “pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible.” But it praised him for charging ahead and delivering “ a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere .”\n \n\n   \n  Well, it turns out most Americans see plenty to dislike about Trump’s handling of the East Wing and the ballroom.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, it appears to be one of the more unpopular things he’s done in this second term. And it’s not just those  who dislike Trump that are objecting.\n \n\n   \n  New  Yahoo News-YouGov  and  Washington Post-ABC News  polls are the first quality surveys to dig into the ballroom saga in depth. And both show similar things.\n \n\n   \n  The former shows Americans disapproved of Trump’s demolition of the East Wing (57%-26%), his plans for replacing it with a 90,000-square foot ballroom (61%-25%) and his broader handling of the situation (55%-28%) all by around a 2-to-1 margin.\n \n\n   \n  The latter shows Americans also oppose the broader project by a 2-to-1 margin, 56%-28%.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump’s supporters aren’t defending him too hard.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, just 55% of Republicans in the Yahoo poll approved of both demolishing the East Wing and building a ballroom. That’s compared to 94% of Democrats who disapproved of both. Around one-quarter of Republicans disapproved on both counts.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the passion on this issue seems to be very much on the “anti” side.\n \n\n   \n  In both polls, the percentage strongly opposed to the project far outpaced the percentage strongly in favor – 46%-18% in the Yahoo poll and 45%-15% in the Post-ABC poll. In both surveys, about half of independents strongly opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  So this  does  appear to have animated people of many stripes, to a significant extent.\n \n\n   \n  None of that means this is a game-changer of a political issue which will suddenly send Trump’s overall approval numbers plummeting to new depths. But it does reinforce that he just keeps doing things rather haphazardly that give lots of people reason to dislike what they’re seeing – even, it seems, some people who generally approve of him.\n \n\n   \n  An important question from there is why people disapprove.\n \n\n   \n  Is it just because they don’t really like change? Were the images of the demolished East Wing just that jarring? Or maybe people objected to the lack of transparency and the fact that Trump downplayed the extent of the construction. (Trump said less than three months ago that the ballroom project “ won’t interfere with the current building ,” even though the White House had released images showing the gigantic ballroom completely replacing the East Wing.)\n \n\n   \n  All of those are valid hypotheses. But the numbers might actually point in another direction.\n \n\n   \n  While people disapproved by about a 2-to-1 margin no matter how you asked the question, they were actually slightly more likely in the Yahoo poll to object to the ballroom plans (61%) than they were to the demolition of the East Wing (57%).\n \n\n   \n  That’s a little counter intuitive.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing demolition was the jarring part. You could see a situation in which people might think the ballroom is okay and even necessary, but don’t like how the East Wing was summarily torn down. But in fact, Americans disliked the ballroom slightly more than the East Wing teardown.\n \n\n   \n  What that might suggest: People don’t really like the idea of building an elaborate new $300 million ballroom – privately funded, Trump says – on the White House grounds during a time of significant economic hardship and inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has shown remarkably little concern about these kinds of optics issues. He’s  gilded the interior of the White House . He and his family have taken little care to insulate themselves from allegations that they’ve ignored conflicts of interest and enriched themselves using the presidency, most notably with their crypto ventures. Even as the country is dealing with the impacts of a government shutdown, Trump is overseas accepting gifts  like a golden crown from South Korea .\n \n\n   \n  There are signs that maybe people are starting to pay attention to this. A  Pew Research Center poll  conducted a month ago showed 61% of Americans and even 31% of Republican-leaning people said they believe Trump has at least “probably” improperly used his office to enrich himself, his friends and his family.\n \n\n   \n  A  CBS News-YouGov poll  around the same time showed 75% of Americans said Trump wasn’t focused enough on the issue of “lowering prices of goods and services.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words, it doesn’t seem to have been a great time to bulldoze part of the White House in the name of building an expensive place to hold parties. And Trump did a great job of making sure people noticed that’s exactly what he was doing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/casey-means-surgeon-general-hearing-delayed-labor","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:15:00-04:00","title":"Confirmation Hearing Delayed for Trump’s Surgeon General Nominee as She Goes Into Labor with Her First Child","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dr. Casey Means, a Stanford-trained doctor and author of the best-selling book 'Good Energy,' was nominated by President Donald Trump in May 2025 as his candidate for surgeon general, following the withdrawal of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat.

is loaded with red flags \n       \n  Analysis by David Goldman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:36 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump made an extraordinary concession in his  landmark deal  with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Thursday: In exchange for promises that China will crack down on fentanyl, the United States will shave 10% off the tariffs it charges on Chinese goods.\n \n\n   \n  On the surface, it’s a promising deal that could restore some of the trade that tariffs had stymied between the world’s two largest economies. The reduction will bring the minimum tariff on Chinese imports down to 20%, and the average tariff rate will fall to around 47%. That’s lofty compared to many other US trading partners but still more in line with the rest of the world.\n \n\n   \n  It could give some relief to US consumers, and it means Chinese goods can shed the outcast status in the United States that Trump’s high tariffs had imposed on them.\n \n\n   \n  But the tariff reduction is also a significant gamble for the Trump administration, which has encountered a persistent problem in its unprecedented trade war with China: ﻿Trump has been  bested by Xi in the trade war  at every turn. Even the fact that they met in person Thursday means Trump has already given into China’s demands. And, as history has proven in these on-again, off-again deals, it’s not clear the United States will get anything serious back by giving in on fentanyl tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Trump risks further eroding America’s relationship with its key allies while gaining a friendlier relationship with its chief economic adversary.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is betting this time will be different. History suggests otherwise.\n \n\n   \n    China’s successful fight against Trump\n \n\n   \n  Trump wanted  four main outcomes  from his  tariffs on China : A reduction in fentanyl coming into the United States, a return of manufacturing to the United States, restoration of the balance of trade and a sale of TikTok’s US assets.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has made real progress on all four: China has pointed to strong actions it has taken toward preventing the export of the foundational chemicals used to make fentanyl. Dozens of companies have promised multibillion-dollar investments in US manufacturing. The US-China trade gap hit a 21-year low in August. And Trump and Xi agreed to the framework of a TikTok deal.\n \n\n   \n  But the frosty relationship has also caused major problems for the United States. China has restricted the export of  rare-earth minerals  – crucial elements in electronics and military equipment. It has refused to buy US soybeans, devastating American farmers. And it has made life more difficult for some key US businesses by launching antitrust investigations. China also has put in place hefty tariffs of its own on US imports.\n \n\n   \n  Despite several rounds of talks with US trade negotiators, China has continued to slow-walk promises to the Trump administration. Rare earths, in particular, became a key sticking point, and earlier guarantees of a free-flowing rare-earth market never materialized. Beijing has even tightened its controls by expanding its restrictions earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Under Thursday’s deal, China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, TikTok’s future in the US remains uncertain after rounds of trade talks between the two countries. Beijing stopped short of confirming a final deal on TikTok has been reached following the Xi-Trump meeting, pledging only to work with the US to “properly address” the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently acknowledged that China often fails to hold up its end of the bargain – including when he  announced in November  2024 that he would raise tariffs on China because of the fentanyl crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States – But to no avail,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social several weeks after Election Day. Then President-elect Trump claimed that Chinese officials promised him the country would execute drug dealers caught funneling drugs into the United States but “never followed through.”\n \n\n   \n    Why Trump is making a deal\n \n\n   \n  So why would Trump make a deal with China on fentanyl now if Xi keeps reneging?\n \n\n   \n  First, China has taken honest-to-goodness action on fentanyl. For example, the country over the summer added two more elements used to make fentanyl to its list of controlled substances. When criminal networks adapted and began selling those elements on the black market, China worked to thwart those exports, too.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Thursday cited China’s  “ very strong action ”  in cracking down on fentanyl as a reason for lowering US tariffs on Chinese goods.\n \n\n   \n  It appears that some  progress has been made on reducing fentanyl  emanating from China in recent years – and there’s some limited evidence that China’s actions are making an impact since Trump’s tariffs went into effect. The US Drug Enforcement Agency in an  annual report  released in May said fentanyl purity declined throughout 2024, consistent with indications that fentanyl cooks in Mexico were having trouble obtaining key precursor chemicals. US Customs and Border Protection have also  reported  that fentanyl stopped at the border was down in 2024 and is on pace to fall again in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Trump may or may not agree that China has made progress on fentanyl, but he sounded a different note on the subject this week than he has sung in the past. He claimed Wednesday that “China is going to be working with me” on restricting the drug.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that they’re going to help us with the fentanyl situation,” Trump said. “They’re going to be doing what they can do.”\n \n\n   \n  Second, China holds significant leverage over the United States. Trump’s tariffs have backfired in numerous ways, including by angering US farmers – a key voting bloc – and creating a rare-earth shortage. China has also refused to fully open up their market to American AI chips, a major Trump goal to help cement US dominance in artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs remain one key lever that Trump can pull, even as China has found markets outside the United States willing to buy its goods, blunting the damage Trump’s levies have imposed.\n \n\n   \n  Still, reducing tariffs represents one key Chinese demand. Trump’s meeting with Xi was another.\n \n\n   \n  Giving up some of that ground – particularly if China has shown some goodwill on fentanyl – gives Trump some ability to get what he wants out of these negotiations. In a vague statement on Thursday, China said it will make “corresponding adjustments” to its countermeasures on fentanyl-related tariffs after Trump agreed to cut the levies by half.\n \n\n   \n    What’s next?\n \n\n   \n  A potential problem for the United States: The other two countries on which the Trump administration has imposed fentanyl tariffs – Mexico and Canada – probably watched Thursday’s announcement with a raised eyebrow and some raised blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries have also made real efforts to restrict fentanyl coming over the US border. And fentanyl coming in from Canada has never posed a major problem, making up less than 1% of overall fentanyl coming into the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, Trump has threatened to raise  Mexico’s  and  Canada’s tariffs  while he is reducing tariffs on China. The deal could improve America’s relationship with its chief economic adversary while angering key allies and its two biggest trading partners.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the reduction in tariffs could help Americans who are paying the price. Albeit slowly, tariffs have raised prices in the United States. Any reduction will be welcome news for inflation-wary consumers.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Liu and Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/lukoil-to-sell-foreign-assets-gunvor-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:44:00+00:00","title":"Crushed by punishing US sanctions, Russia’s Lukoil accepts offer to sell its international business","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, has accepted an offer from global commodity trader Gunvor to sell its international assets, a direct response to U.S. sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine.

cut agreed with China after high-stakes talks \n       \n  By Betsy Klein and Simone McCarthy\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:49 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A landmark meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump on  the sidelines of an international summit  in South Korea Thursday appears to have made major strides to resolve frictions in the volatile relationship between the world’s two largest economies and rival superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders had agreed on “almost everything” and reached a trade deal that could be signed “pretty soon,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after wrapping up the highly anticipated meeting with Xi, which capped his five-day tour of Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Xi also pointed to the “consensus” reached on resolving “important economic and trade issues” and called on the two sides to “refine and finalize follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus, and deliver tangible results,” according to a Chinese readout.\n \n\n   \n  “Economic and trade relations should continue to be the ballast and engine of Sino-US relations, not a stumbling block or point of conflict,” the Chinese leader said.\n \n\n   \n  The two appeared to find common ground on their duelling export controls, with a readout from Beijing saying that the Chinese sides would suspend for one year the implementation of sweeping export controls  on rare earth minerals , in exchange for the US hitting a one-year pause on a rule announced in September that would vastly expand the number of Chinese companies restricted from buying certain American technologies.\n \n\n   \n  In his comments to reporters, Trump said the understanding would “eliminate” roadblocks to the export of the strategically critical materials and could be renewed each year. He did not explicitly mention the pause on the US rules.\n \n\n   \n  Under their consensus, the US would reduce by 10% of existing tariffs on Chinese imports – in exchange for what Trump said was Xi’s pledge to crack down further on China’s role in the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl into the US. A truce that reduced an escalation from both sides to triple-digit levies earlier this year would remain in effect, according to statement from both sides.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said that would bring the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods to 47%. China said it would make “corresponding adjustments” to its US tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  China would also ramp up purchases of “tremendous amounts” of American soybeans, Trump said, with Beijing noting that the two sides had “reached consensus” on expanding agricultural trade. Beijing also said the two sides would suspend tit-for-tat port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors.\n \n\n   \n  One of China’s top concerns – US export controls blocking its access to high end technology including semi-conductors – was discussed, according to Trump, but didn’t appear to have yielded any new breakthroughs.\n \n\n   \n  On the lingering issue surrounding TikTok’s future, China said it will work with the US to “properly address” it, but stopped short of confirming a final deal has been reached.\n \n\n   \n  The one-hour-and forty-minute meeting – the leaders’ first in six years – also appeared provide a key venue for the two men to stress their interest in stabilizing their countries’ fractious relationship.\n \n\n   \n  In comments ahead of the talks, Trump praised Xi as the “great leader of a great country” and said he thought the two “were going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” while the Chinese leader said it was a “great pleasure” to see Trump after many years.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then … you and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course,” Xi said, adding the two nations could “prosper together.\n \n\n   \n    Troubled trade\n \n\n   \n  The global economy has for months been roiled by a tit-for-tat of mounting tariffs, export controls and other penalties hitting areas from high-tech goods to high-seas shipping, as the US and China have vacillated between escalation and negotiation.\n \n\n   \n  At the crux of those tensions are a gaping trade imbalance and efforts from the US to ensure its national security against an increasingly assertive China, including by expanding restrictions on China’s access to American high tech, like the advanced semiconductors needed to power AI.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also appeared to raise the stakes of the meeting moments before landing in Busan, announcing the end of a more than three-decade moratorium on US nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the US “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China “a distant third,” but catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” he wrote. It was not immediately clear what he was referring to as neither of the three countries has tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China hopes the US will “earnestly uphold its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s statement added to other twists and turns ahead of the meeting, including Trump openly questioning whether it would happen and threatening additional tariffs and export controls on critical software in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Eleventh-hour trade negotiations by top officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, set the meeting on track. Expectations rose on both sides, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, with the hopes that the deal would produce more than just a low-key touchpoint between the two world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  But the consensus reached will be just one touchstone in a thorny and volatile great power rivalry between the world’s superpower democracy and an authoritarian China, whose growing military assertiveness under Xi in the East and South China Seas is rattling US allies in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Both sides have seen a leader-level meeting as key to stabilizing the relationship as they continue to grapple with how to structure their economic ties.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting offered a win for China, which wants predictability in its US relations while it sprints toward self-sufficiency from American high-tech, and also for Trump, whose meeting with Xi delivers a big-ticket finale for what has already been a dealmaking blitz across Asia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/basketball-nba-sports-business-cosm","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"NBA and Cosm Extend Partnership to 2030, Pioneering Immersive Fan Experiences","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NBA and Cosm, a start-up entertainment company reinventing the sports bar with immersive 'shared reality' domes, have extended their partnership into 2030 and beyond.

world’s most intriguing start-up companies \n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of the sports world’s most intriguing start-up companies is renewing its long-term partnership with its first-ever major  professional sports league  partner.\n \n\n   \n  The  NBA  and Cosm, the entertainment company that’s reinventing the sports bar with what they like to call “shared reality,” announced Thursday an extended partnership to air live NBA games in Cosm’s domes. The IMAX-esque experience allows Cosm’s customers to watch live sporting events on its unique 87-foot-diameter, 12L+ LED screens that have gone viral for offering a first-of-its-kind experience for fans.\n \n\n   \n  The NBA was Cosm’s first-ever league partner long before the company opened its first location in Los Angeles in 2024. The two entities are now set to work together into 2030 and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  “Our ambition is to give another option for fans that might be out of the marketplace or their favorite team is on the road, or they haven’t been able to get to those courtside seats or lower bowl seats,” said Jeb Terry, Cosm’s president and CEO, in an interview with  CNN Sports . “So, it’s really complementary, I would say, to the NBA’s ambition of opening up access, giving fans more ways to celebrate the game, and providing other opportunities to lean into that action.\n \n\n   \n  “And that’s why it was really an obvious opportunity from the beginning. Because not only is that the innovative spirit of the league, the tech-forward approach, but the same way we approach it by leveraging technology to augment that fan experience and give more optionality, so fans can just lean in and celebrate wherever they are, whether they’re in-market, out-of-market, wherever that may be.”\n \n\n   \n  The extended partnership will allow Cosm to produce and distribute live NBA games at Cosm’s venues for at least the next five years. That means Cosm will be able to send its in-house production team, which is responsible for the unique views provided to viewers at their domes, to key national TV games, events from next year’s  All-Star Weekend , the  playoffs  and  NBA Finals .\n \n\n   \n  Teddy Kaplan, NBA vice president and head of new media partnerships at the league, said working with Cosm has been a no-brainer for his team from the start.\n \n\n   \n  Kaplan was on a ski trip to Park City, Utah, in 2022 when he got the opportunity to visit Cosm’s headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. He diverted from that vacation for a bit to see what the company was working on and was introduced to Cosm’s experience center for the first time, which gave him an idea of what the finished domes would be like.\n \n\n   \n  He left that meeting wowed.\n \n\n   \n  “I got there and I said, ‘Oh my God, this is, this is the future. This is what we need,’” Kaplan told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  He added, “Our fans are young, tech-savvy, diverse, and they push us to be innovative. And as you’ll see, across our portfolio of distribution points, we’re always looking for ways to innovate the way fans watch our game, whether it’s alt streams, whether it’s via virtual reality, whether it’s with our social partners. Cosm is the perfect piece in our broader network here.”\n \n\n   \n  The initial partnership with the NBA, agreed to in February 2023, was an important inflection point in the company’s history, according to Terry.\n \n\n   \n  That kind of high-profile partner gave Cosm – at that point about a year-and-a-half from opening its first location near SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California – much needed legitimacy as it entered into discussions with other leagues and broadcast companies that hold the rights to sporting events aired in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “When you’re building companies, there’s always these pivotal moments along the way. You get the technology sorted. You’re like, ‘OK, it works.’ Then you have to work on getting market adoption, and there’s a lot of ways to do that with our business,” Terry said.\n \n\n   \n  “Partnerships are paramount. They are critical to how we bring this to life with our fans. And so, having the NBA as our first, it was a great moment for our company to announce it … and then get that word of mouth trending within the industry and then pushing that forward. And so, you look to have all these credible moments along the way in this growth phase. And this was one of the big ones.”\n \n\n   \n  The next move for Cosm is scaling up into more locations. It currently has domes open at that initial location in Inglewood and one in Dallas. Three more locations have been announced in Detroit, Cleveland and Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  That puts the company in five NBA cities and looking to expand to more, including overseas locations that could put international fans closer to professional American basketball in a way that’s much cheaper and easier than flying across an ocean to get into an NBA arena.\n \n\n   \n  Given that Cosm is able to show its customers views that they would have to pay dearly to afford – the courtside view from the scorer’s table, underneath the hoops in the front row at either end of the floor – all from the comfort of a sports bar environment, Kaplan said the hope is that NBA fans will be able to approximate that experience from the domes.\n \n\n   \n  “We like to use the stat that 99% of our fans will never make it to an NBA game, and that’s in the US. When you go global, it’s 99.99%. And when you think about sitting courtside, basically 100%, right?” Kaplan said.\n \n\n   \n  “And so having Cosm as a tool to bring fans closer to the game and speak to those tech-savvy fans is really perfect for us.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/boxing-mayweather-pacquiao-rematch-negotiations-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:26:00Z","title":"Blockbuster rematch between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao ‘almost’ agreed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Manny Pacquiao has revealed that a rematch with Floyd Mayweather Jr. is 'almost' agreed upon, with both camps in negotiations.

to Trump’s trade deal with China? \n       \n  By Ramishah Maruf, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:32 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US trade deal with China seeks to resolve a major sticking point of their ongoing trade war: rare-earth minerals.\n \n\n   \n  Despite multiple rounds of talks with US trade negotiators over the past several months, China continued to slow-walk promises to the Trump administration that it would free up crucial rare-earth metals, and earlier guarantees of expedited rare-earth licenses to US companies never materialized. Beijing even  tightened earlier this month  its controls by massively expanding its restrictions..\n \n\n   \n  Under  Thursday’s deal , China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.\n \n\n   \n  The tussle over rare earths precedes the current administration; China  for years  has built up near-total control of the   minerals   as part of its wider  industrial policy .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know about rare earths.\n \n\n   \n    What are rare earths, and are they actually ‘rare?’\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths include   17 metallic elements in the periodic table made up of scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides.\n \n\n   \n  The name “rare earths” is a bit of a misnomer, as the materials are found throughout the Earth’s crust. They are more abundant than gold, but they are difficult and costly to extract and process and are   also  environmentally damaging .\n \n\n   \n    What are rare earths used for?\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths are ubiquitous in everyday technologies, from smartphones to wind turbines to LED lights and flat-screen TVs. They’re crucial for batteries in electric vehicles, as well as MRI scanners and cancer treatments.\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths are also essential for the US military. They’re used in F-35 fighter jets, submarines, lasers, satellites, Tomahawk missiles and more, according to a 2025 research  note  from CSIS.\n \n\n   \n    Where do rare earths come from?\n \n\n   \n  Sixty-one percent of mined rare earth production comes from China, according to the International Energy Agency, and the country controls  92%  of the global output in the processing stage.\n \n\n   \n  There are two types of rare earths, categorized by their atomic weights: heavy and light. Heavy rare earths are more scarce, and the United States doesn’t have the capability to separate rare earths after extraction.\n \n\n   \n  “Until the start of the year, whatever heavy rare earths we did mine in California, we still sent to China for separation,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Trump administration’s announcement of sky-high tariffs on China in April derailed this process. “China has shown a willingness to weaponize” America’s reliance on China for rare earth separation, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The US has one operational rare earth mine in California, according to Baskaran.\n \n\n   \n    Why do rare earths matter in the trade war?\n \n\n   \n  Beijing is using rare earths as major leverage in the trade war, and its latest restrictions were a major topic of conversation when Xi and Trump met Thursday at the APEC summit in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, China  added five rare-earth elements  – holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium, and related magnets and materials – to its existing control list, requiring export licenses. That makes the total amount of restricted rare earths to 12.   China also required licenses to export rare earth manufacturing technologies out of the country.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time this year that Chinese restrictions on rare earths have angered Trump. In June, Trump said on Truth Social that  China violated a trade truce  as   Beijing kept its export controls on seven rare earth minerals and associated products.\n \n\n   \n  The export controls could have a major impact, since the US is heavily reliant on China for rare earths. Between 2020 and 2023, 70% of US imports of rare earth compounds and metals came from the country, according to a  US Geological Survey report .\n \n\n   \n  But China’s latest restrictions were seen as a dramatic escalation in Trump’s trade war between the world’s two biggest economic powers.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Nectar Gan, John Liu, Donald Judd, Kylie Atwood, Phil Mattingly and David Goldman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/lily-allen-nun-west-end-girl-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:25:00-04:00","title":"Look of the Week: Lily Allen is a wayward nun, cigarette and all","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lily Allen’s new album, 'West End Girl', serves as a raw and introspective account of the collapse of her five-year marriage to actor David Harbour, which began in September 2020 after they met on the dating app Raya.

EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There are no saints in the aftermath of a complicated breakup, and in one of the visuals accompanying Lily Allen’s latest album, “West End Girl” — interpreted as a post-mortem on her marriage to actor David Harbour — she assumes the role of the wayward nun, donning the familiar black and white habit to take a smoke break.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise album, which Allen released last Friday, can be taken as a play-by-play of the downfall of her five-year marriage, which began with Las Vegas nuptials in September 2020 after the couple met on celebrity dating app Raya. Though Allen did  tell Vogue  the album is only “inspired” by the relationship and not “all gospel.”\n \n\n   \n  Since its release, listeners have been piecing together a bigger picture of their relationship and its fallout, referencing the lyrics with years of reports and rumors. Also in the crossfire: the couple’s divisive  Architectural Digest feature  in early 2023, featuring their eclectic Brooklyn townhouse, which is now being retrospectively eyed as a warning sign. (“Perhaps The David Harbour-Lily Allen Home Is Worth Wrecking,” pop culture critic Hunter Harris  penned  as a Substack headline at the time.)\n \n\n   \n  Blessedly, the album visuals are striking not in their maximalism, but their quieter reverie. Throughout the images, Allen unsettles Catholic iconography: In one looped video, she clasps her hands in prayer, wearing the blue and red of Mother Mary; on the album’s cover, painter Nieves González  depicts  the singer as an updated Baroque icon, stoic in polka dots and chiaroscuro lighting.\n \n\n   \n  In the video loop of Allen as a nun, she crosses a leg to reveal sheer tights and black pumps as she smokes a cigarette. She seems to be grappling with the duality of desire — something she candidly sings to in the song “Sleepwalking” (“I know you’ve made me your Madonna / I wanna be your wh**e”). But the visual metaphor resonates across the album at large. Allen doesn’t depict herself as the virtuous, scorned wife, but a real and raw person who cycles through anxiety and insecurity until everything reaches its bitter end.\n \n\n   \n  Nun imagery has often been deployed in music, art and fashion to symbolize a reverence that is readily subverted, by sex, sin or feminism. Lady Gaga has worn the habit in music videos and on tour, while designers including Rick Owens have frequently played with the cloth caps’ austere form. And though Allen’s version of a nun is certainly no stranger to vice, she is perhaps most subverted by a lack of faith in herself, as she painfully recounts going against her better judgement again and again.\n \n\n   \n  “Listen, I am in a period of self-discovery at the moment and I’m really trying to explore how I’ve got myself into certain situations in the past,” she told Vogue. “I need to unpack some things and break some patterns and probably talk to my therapist about my relationship with my dad.”\n \n\n   \n  Online, some commentators have already dubbed the upcoming months “West End Girl Winter,” as Allen ushers in a period of self-reflection, leaving 2024’s “ Brat summer ” far in the rearview mirror. The key items for this new season are yet to be determined, but will presumably include a posh home, smudged eyeliner, revenge heels and an incisive pen. The full nun’s habit remains optional.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/louvre-jewels-heist-arrests-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:08:00-04:00","title":"Five new suspects arrested over Louvre heist – but still no sign of looted jewels","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five new suspects have been arrested in connection with a high-profile heist at the Louvre museum in Paris, bringing the total number of arrests to seven.

Paris prosecutor announced Thursday, bringing the total number of arrests over the  stunning heist  to seven.\n \n\n   \n  Of the five new suspects, one is believed to have been part of the four-man gang who carried out the heist, Laure Beccuau, the prosecutor, told French radio RTL.\n \n\n   \n  This means that, following an 11-day manhunt, police have now arrested three of the four men they believe participated directly in the heist, disguising themselves as construction workers to steal artifacts dating to the Napoleonic era.\n \n\n   \n  Beccuau said the investigation had yet to uncover any of the looted treasures, estimated to be worth  more than $100 million . Experts say the jewels – among them an emerald necklace set with more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife – were likely to be dismantled for their raw materials.\n \n\n   \n  The latest arrests took place Wednesday night in Paris and in the surrounding region, including in Seine-Saint-Denis.\n \n\n   \n  The first two suspects were arrested last weekend, just as one was reported to be trying to flee to Algeria from the Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris.\n \n\n   \n  Those two suspects were placed under formal investigation for organized theft and criminal conspiracy. The pair have  “partially admitted”  their involvement following 96 hours of questioning, Beccuau announced late Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The first suspect, 34, is of Algerian nationality. He had prior records for traffic-related offenses and was identified through DNA recovered from one of the scooters.\n \n\n   \n  The second suspect, 39, is an illegal taxi driver and delivery driver born in Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris.

paycheck \n       \n  By Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:30 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For certain workers at the Federal Aviation Administration, the government shutdown hit hardest this week with a $0 paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  It’s “disheartening,” to not be paid by an employer, said Cleverson Schmidt, a radar technician based in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to stay level, and I’m praying I don’t get a heart attack or stroke,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  His job, which he is required to do even though he is not being paid, includes certifying aircraft systems for controllers to use. The equipment has to be flawless, he said. It’s how controllers make air traffic decisions with planes full of hundreds of passengers.\n \n\n   \n  His family mostly relies on his income, as his wife works part-time and stays home with their son.\n \n\n   \n  It broke Schmidt’s heart as a father to tell his son a month ago that he couldn’t get his allowance due to the family’s financial situation.\n \n\n   \n  “Having to tell your child that you can’t provide for them is a difficult burden,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Working six days a week and now not getting paid\n \n\n   \n  Many of these critical federal jobs were understaffed, and the people who do them overworked even before the shutdown, making the gap in pay even harder to take.\n \n\n   \n  Corinne Wiseman’s husband – a controller at the Boston TRACON - supports them on his sole income, often working Thursday through Monday and then a sixth day on Tuesday, when he must pick up mandatory overtime.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s not really home,” Wiseman said. “He doesn’t already see his kids hardly at all. Not his fault. It’s his schedule.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has omitted her husband’s name to maintain his anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  The schedules at the FAA are demanding – oftentimes controllers work long hours through the evenings or overnights, making critical decisions and setting personal life aside to maintain the safety of the flying public.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman said it is “hard to not get personal about it,” knowing that her husband has missed years with their four children already, and now he’s not getting paid to do his job and support his family. Her husband has built up exhaustion and resentment, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “(Being an air traffic controller) has been my husband’s dream for almost two decades and in the last five years, I have only seen a decline in his mindset,” she said. “He loves the work, he is angry that the federal government could get away treating them the way they have.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, some controllers are calling out sick causing a rippling effect of staffing shortages and delays.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to this shutdown, the family had taken out a loan to complete some much-needed repairs around their home. That included new windows, a new roof and more, she said. Now, they’re left to cut costs elsewhere to ensure bills get paid. She said the family keeps the heat off in the house for as long as possible and mostly uses firewood to keep warm.\n \n\n   \n  “As a spouse, watching your significant other feel the full weight of the financial strain of the family while also being unable to physically be present is painful and stressful,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman stays home to take care of their children, but since the shutdown she has been looking for an online job to help their family while still managing their schedules.\n \n\n   \n  “In our family, the stress is just always there, just because the career itself is already extremely stressful and takes a lot of time away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    No end in sight\n \n\n   \n  For now, Schmidt is calling creditors to figure out what bills must be paid. He takes side jobs to make extra cash, and many of his colleagues are doing the same, he said. Schmidt’s union, the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, represents about 11,000 FAA employees. About 5,000 of them, like Schmidt, are working without pay during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to stay strong and do my job with dignity and with the best of my ability,” Schmidt said. “I don’t think I could handle if I was responsible for a loss of life, a loss of lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Keeping the public safe is something that drives many aviation workers, even when they aren’t getting paid, despite the hardships on their families.\n \n\n   \n  As the holidays approach, Wiseman’s family of six is already making adjustments to pinch pennies where needed. She’s canceled or postponed doctor’s appointments, chiropractic care and vet appointments to avoid co-pays or bills piling up.\n \n\n   \n  All four of Wiseman’s children are in their pre-teen to teenage years, involved in activities and costly sports. One has even started driving, which helps Wiseman keep up with the schedules, but adds another cost given high car insurance rates for a new driver.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been just trying to be very frugal, like extra spending at a very bare minimum,” she said, noting the family doesn’t eat out anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman’s children carpool for sports to avoid additional expenses. The couple is not sending their youngest son to an out-of-state hockey tournament in two weeks because of the financial strain it would cause. He’s a goalie.\n \n\n   \n  The family has been through this before. In January 2019, the decision by 10 air traffic controllers, which didn’t include Wiseman’s husband, to call out sick helped end that 35-day long shutdown. Their absence temporarily shut down travel at New York’s LaGuardia airport and caused delays at other major hubs in New Jersey, Philadelphia and Atlanta, driving President Trump to agree to a temporary government funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  How this shutdown will end is anyone’s guess, but for now these families are struggling to cover their costs as they still report to work.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/chess-danny-rensch-profile-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:05:00-04:00","title":"From being raised in ‘the Collective’ to being a ‘shepherd’ of chess: the winding journey of Danny Rensch","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Danny Rensch, once raised in a cult-like environment known as the Church of Immortal Consciousness, overcame emotional and psychological trauma—including forced separation from his mother, substance abuse, and intense pressure to excel in chess—to become a leading figure in the modern chess world.

being raised in ‘the Collective’ to being a ‘shepherd’ of chess: the winding journey of Danny Rensch \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:05 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Danny Rensch is at the vanguard of chess.\n \n\n   \n  He, alongside a few others, has helped to develop the sport from one which was played by the elites to a phenomenon that has exploded in recent years, particularly thanks to the rising popularity of online chess.\n \n\n   \n  But to get to where he is now – a self-described “shepherd” for chess in his role as chief chess officer at Chess.com – Rensch has been on quite the life path.\n \n\n   \n  As he describes in his new memoir, “Dark Squares: How Chess Saved My Life,” Rensch was raised in Arizona in what he describes as a cult, a group that he says orchestrated a separation from his own mother and exploited his proficiency at playing chess for its own reputational gain.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch had to overcome many hurdles: Surviving emotional and substance abuse, developing tinnitus and allegedly being manipulated by a charismatic leader by being told he’d be the savior of chess. But along the way, his journey has taken him from a small commune to becoming a guiding light in a sport which, he believes, still has plenty of opportunity to grow.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the hardship and trauma he’s dealt with over his life, Rensch says he doesn’t hold any resentment. He believes the struggles of his past are all part of life’s rich tapestry, highlighting a quote from influential Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung as the motto he lives by: “We are not what happens to us, we are what we choose to become.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think we can learn through pain and suffering sadly, but also it can give us an appreciation for what we have,” Rensch told CNN Sports. “Part of my journey is that what grief has taught me is that your relationships are what matter the most and connecting with other people through whatever you’re doing is what actually gives you purpose.\n \n\n   \n  “Your purpose is not anything you do. It is what you feel and what you find within why you do it. And I adhere myself to the fact that I am not what has happened to me. I am what I’ve chosen to become. And I try to take that into everything that I do and everything that we do at Chess.com.”\n \n\n   \n    Life in the ‘Collective’\n \n\n   \n  Growing up, Rensch recalls in his memoir that he was afforded the freedom to run around with children his own age, spending days in the woods with his friends or splashing around in the water.\n \n\n   \n  That was initially what life was like inside the now-disbanded Church of Immortal Consciousness.\n \n\n   \n  According to the group’s beliefs, the Church of Immortal Consciousness followed the teachings of Dr. Pahlvon Duran, a figure who last lived in the 15th century. Rensch describes the group as a spiritual haven for those looking for direction. Known internally as the Collective, the group sought to give lost souls direction – or as they called it, a Purpose – in a supposedly egalitarian society.\n \n\n   \n  Run by Steven and Trina Kamp, the Collective would meet to ensure members focused on their spiritual alignment and, as a group, would pool their money together to ensure they were financially merged.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch recalls they would organize meetings – called Processes – where the members of the Collective would discuss whether or not a fellow member was following the teachings of Duran and, therefore, if they were spiritually pure. Rensch says in his memoir that these meetings often descended into loud arguments due to the amount of alcohol being consumed, and it would not be uncommon for someone to be “glassed” by having a full cup of liquid thrown in their face.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Kamp has previously denied the Church of Immortal Consciousness was a cult.\n \n\n   \n  Families would share accommodations, with Rensch recalling sharing beds with other kids across multiple abodes. But as a child, this was just something he was used to at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Many traveled to the Collective in search of meaning. But, as Rensch came to find out, life in an idealistic commune often doesn’t end in spiritual happiness.\n \n\n   \n  Despite preaching an equal society, it became apparent to Rensch that that wasn’t the case. He references a famous George Orwell quote from the classic novella Animal Farm when describing the hierarchy inside the Collective: “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.”\n \n\n   \n  “There were leaders and there was a literal hierarchy, a totem pole system. In some ways, the members self-ranked and sort of self-flagellated in order to keep everything in check,” Rensch explained to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Hassan, a licensed mental health professional and one of the leading experts on cults, told CNN Sports that these kinds of groups can cause a “dissociative disorder and a disruption of identity” in members.\n \n\n   \n  Hassan has personal experience having been a former member of the  Unification Church , the controversial religion founded by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon in South Korea in 1954 and accused by critics of being a cult.\n \n\n   \n  “So in my case, I went from Steven Hassan of Flushing Queens, youngest of three kids, nice Jewish boy, wasn’t political, to a right-wing fascist wanting to take over the world,” Hassan said.\n \n\n   \n  “And so I had a pseudo-identity in the image of the cult. So my own critical thinking was pushed down. It wasn’t erased, but it was pushed down. The public has this incorrect assumption that people who get into cults are weak or stupid or uneducated, and it’s just not true. In Danny’s case, he had no choice.”\n \n\n   \n  As a child, the social dynamics of the group didn’t register with Rensch. But in hindsight, he is now able to recognize the pitfalls of the group.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch says in his book that the Kamps were able to weaponize the faith the Collective preached in an attempt to alter people’s life courses for the gain of the individual and the group. Whether it be how they raised their children or the job they were doing, the Kamps could decide whether it was the right fit spiritually and, if not, take steps to adjust.\n \n\n   \n  Also, in the search of spiritual happiness, it was commonplace for families to undergo dramatic changes. Husbands would leave their wives in search of their “Like Vibration” – a better fitting partner in the eyes of the Collective – and Rensch says children would be separated from their parents and adopted into other families to allow the child to flourish.\n \n\n   \n    Separation\n \n\n   \n  Rensch was an ordinary kid who liked ordinary activities. But his whole life changed upon watching the film “Searching for Bobby Fischer.”\n \n\n   \n  He was immediately gripped by a sport which was so different to any other, one which tested the brain in completely different ways than any other.\n \n\n   \n  And, as it turned out, Rensch was good at it from the outset. He would spend hours playing and teaching himself until his skills eventually caught the eye of church leader Steven Kamp.\n \n\n   \n  Kamp, a chess fan himself, saw the potential in Rensch’s game. Rensch said he later came to realize that Kamp saw Rensch’s ability at chess as a way of legitimizing the teachings of the Collective and justify the way the group worked.\n \n\n   \n  CNN Sports has attempted to contact Kamp to offer him the chance to comment.\n \n\n   \n  According to Rensch, Kamp took it upon himself to make sure that the boy received special chess training – including hiring the former Soviet defector, Igor Ivanov – and providing funds and transport so Rensch could travel to tournaments around Arizona and the country to test his skills. More than that, Kamp instructed Rensch that chess had become his Purpose, therefore instilling a religious importance to a game he was in his formative stages in learning.\n \n\n   \n  This added pressure on chess distorted his view on what was meant to be an enjoyable game, Rensch says.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was receiving discipline, to say it was wrapped up in shame and self-worth doesn’t even do it justice because the shame and self-worth was meant to transcend this lifetime. It was meant to transcend the planet,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n  “It was like: ‘Oh, I’m actually, literally going to hell if I’m not putting my efforts into getting as good as I can at chess all the time.’”\n \n\n   \n  This added attention and time to focus on chess meant Rensch quickly went from promising youngster to tournament winner and chess prodigy. Over his chess career, he would become the youngest national chess master in Arizona history and a multi-time national scholastic champion.\n \n\n   \n  But this success came with a catch: Kamp took it upon himself to push Rensch further and further into the chess world, no matter the consequences, Rensch says. He saw Rensch as a future grandmaster.\n \n\n   \n  The constant flights and elevation changes involved in the journeys he was making across the US resulted in Rensch developing tinnitus, he said, which would eventually develop into chronic pain, infections and sinus pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch describes the most painful moment of his time with the group as being when he was separated from his mother, with his future success at chess given as a main reason why that move was orchestrated.\n \n\n   \n  Hassan said that children being separated from their parents is commonplace in cults, saying “parent alienation” is a typical practice.\n \n\n   \n  “This is something that typically happens with authoritarian cults. One of the parents gets into a cult, the other one doesn’t want to,” Hassan said. “So I’ve seen that one for 48 years. Every single cult does that as a thing.”\n \n\n   \n  Rensch’s chess playing career would eventually fizzle out, and looking back in hindsight, his relationship with the sport changed as he grew up and could recognize the environment he was living in.\n \n\n   \n  “The game gave me everything and then it took everything away. And I’ve been to hell and back with chess so many times,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Moving on\n \n\n   \n  As Rensch went through his life in the Collective and his chess playing faded away, his issues continued to pile up.\n \n\n   \n  While he met his wife Shauna and had children of his own, Rensch says he dealt with alcohol and substance abuse as he struggled with the dynamic of the Collective and how he fit in. Shauna was briefly with the Collective when she was six but moved away before returning later in life.\n \n\n   \n  He recalls the moment he decided to leave the Collective shortly after the birth of his second child and coming to the painful realization that it was time to move on.\n \n\n   \n  That decoupling wasn’t an easy thought to process for Rensch, having spent most of his life with the group.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever I could do to myself, whatever baggage I was willing to carry, as long as it was just me, there was probably a part of me that could or would do it forever,” he said. “And that’s part of how you dip in and out of addictive behavior and back out again, you dip in and out of almost ruining your marriage but then barely saving it.”\n \n\n   \n    Stewards\n \n\n   \n  By that point, in 2009, Rensch had begun coaching on Chess.com. It was a humble beginning, but it allowed him to get his foot in the door at an organization which would soon enjoy a meteoric rise.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t easy at the beginning. The website was set up in 2007 and, at that time, the main online chess platform was the Internet Chess Club (ICC).\n \n\n   \n  Through years of development and clever marketing, Chess.com was able to develop into the dominant force of internet chess, with Rensch playing a key role behind that growth.\n \n\n   \n  As well as making it the main platform for coaches to help nurture the next generation of chess stars, a key manta in developing Chess.com was to open the sport to the wider community, with Rensch admitting that the game has at times been a “gatekeep community” by the “intellectually elite or (those who) want to revere and worship the intellectually elite.”\n \n\n   \n  “We were like: ‘This is wrong.’ And I saw that it was wrong from having failed to try to reach the mountain as a prodigy and (Chess.com CEO and co-founder) Erik (Allebest) saw that it was wrong as someone who always loved the game but felt kept out of the club,” Rensch said.\n \n\n   \n  Nowadays, Chess.com is home to over 230 million members, sees more than one billion moves being played every day, and is valued at over $1 billion with no venture backing, according to the company. During those early years as a start-up, the only financial backing the site was ever able to receive was a $70,000 temporary loan from the mom of Allebest’s friend.\n \n\n   \n  As one of the biggest organizations in the sport, Chess.com has also had to weather its fair share of controversy, most notably a  cheating scandal  involving an accusation from Magnus Carlsen that Hans Niemann cheated in an over-the-board game. Niemann was  eventually cleared of cheating  in that particular match.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch said that the episode taught the people involved with Chess.com that it had “way more influence than we thought we did.”\n \n\n   \n  But despite the meteoric rise and the sway the site now has over the sport, Rensch and his colleagues see themselves as guiding hands.\n \n\n   \n  “We really are the shepherds of something that belongs to humanity and we do not take that for granted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “The truth is we always had a bit of an existential – viewing ourselves from 30,000 feet – view that this was kind of bigger than us and that we owed chess the opportunity to reach more people.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/feathers-fashion-runway-shows","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:48:00-04:00","title":"The plume boom: Feathers are coming for your spring wardrobes","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article explores the resurgence of feathers in high fashion, from New York to Paris and London, highlighting their historical roots in ancient Egypt and 19th-century imperial luxury.

 \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  First it took hold at New York Fashion Week. Black feathers spilling out the front of a beige car coat at Brandon Maxwell. An Altuzarra knit two-piece that made its wearer look like they had been tarred and feathered, but beautifully rather than as some heinous ancient punishment. A strapless gown that appeared cloud-like through rows and rows of delicate white plumes at Prabal Gurung.\n \n\n   \n  The London shows were in on the game too — the cascading, multi-colored plumage of a Roksanda evening gown, or feral, feather-stuffed Converse high tops at Oscar Ouyang. In  Paris , designers moved with the synchronization of a swallow murmuration. Pierpaolo Piccoli’s proposition for Balenciaga rested on feather-work: There was the full, plume-covered maxi skirt paired with a casual T-shirt, since worn in the wild by Elle Fanning, as well as a number of boxy dresses finished with delicate feather trims.\n \n\n   \n  For Chanel,  Matthieu Blazy  set its specialist atelier Maison Lemarié on the task of creating feather Camellias, headpieces, earrings and large skirts. At Victoria Beckham the dresses were smaller, but no less quilled. Even The Row, the cult favorite of every millennial minimalist, dipped its toe into the showy textile with mid-length skirts that were given a feathery facade. Stella McCartney, fashion’s stalwart eco-warrior, joined in too with the invention of the world’s first plant-based alternative to feathers.\n \n\n   \n  There was Big Bird Energy all over the runways this season. But how did bird feathers become a symbol of luxury in the first place?\n \n\n   \n  Plumage has been in fashion since ancient Egypt, when ostrich feathers were used to decorate fans and even appeared in hieroglyphics. In Babylonian and Assyrian artworks, too, feathers are often seen covering the bodies of deities or embellishing royal crowns.\n \n\n   \n  Around the mid-1500s, feathers entered the wardrobes of real people, at least in the UK. “That’s when they start to be worn specifically for fashionable reasons,” said Dr. Elisabeth Gernerd — a fashion historian and professor at De Montfort University in England. The ever-practical Brits worked with what they had to hand; attaching goose, chicken and egrets feathers that had been sterilized in chalk and sulfur to hats and fans. But while the material was fairly common, working people often reserved it for more everyday tools like making brooms or bedding.\n \n\n   \n   18th century trend-setter Marie Antoinette  popularized the style of having large, stately plumes — usually ostrich, the most prominent feather globally traded — erupting from a tower of hair. So giant were these headpieces, newspapers at the time often wrote salaciously about whose feathers caught fire from a candlelight at which ball. But it wasn’t until the 19th century, as the British Empire expanded and global trade routes became more established, that the “feather craze” reached its peak, according to Gernerd.\n \n\n   \n  Birds of paradise from islands such as New Guinea were hunted and skinned, then exported to Europe and the US, where they were sold to milliners at auctions in London, Paris and Amsterdam. Their exotic feathers became associated with a new level of luxury and access. “In the 19th century, the Empire was in fashion and feathers are a way to display that fashion,” said Gernerd. “You’re wearing something that has travelled thousands of miles to get to you. You’re a symbol of growing Imperialism and trade.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t just the odd plume, either. Entire hummingbirds were taxidermied and mounted on circular, feathered fans in the 1870s; while larger preserved birds adorned velvet bonnets. By the 1900s, millions of birds had been killed for the feather trade, threatening the extinction of several species. Demand was so high, the millinery industry was even pricing out American ornithologists from buying specimens for scientific research. When the Titanic sank in 1912, one of the most valuable commodities onboard was a container of ostrich feathers being shipped to New York. “They were insured for around $2.3 million in today’s money,” Gernerd said. “They were worth essentially as much as diamonds.”\n \n\n   \n  But the style wasn’t universally accepted, and some campaigned against the mass slaughtering of the endangered animals. Harriet Hemenway and Minna B. Hall, two Boston socialites, turned against the fashion of their peers — launching a series of tea parties to attempt to dissuade other high-society women from wearing feathers. They founded the Audubon Society, an environmental conservation group, in 1905 — managing to influence state laws, such as the 1910 Audubon Plumage Law which prohibited the sale or possession of feathers from protected birds in New York State. By 1918, they had their first major victory: the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a federal law that made it illegal to hunt, capture or sell any migratory bird. In 1921, the UK passed its own anti-plumage legislation which outlawed the importing of exotic birds for fashion. But frustratingly for activists, ostrich — one of the most prominently used feathers in the fashion industry today because of their unique individual filaments and diffused softness — were exempt from conservation laws, according to Gernerd, since their feathers can technically be harvested without killing or skinning the animal.\n \n\n   \n    Are feathers the new fur?\n \n\n   \n  Today, many fashion designers such as Donatella Versace, John Galliano and the late Giorgio Armani, have openly rejected the use of fur after decades of animal welfare campaigns — while luxury brands such as Gucci, Chanel, Prada and Burberry have also committed to going fur-free. Earlier this year Conde Nast  announced  it will no longer feature new animal fur in editorial content or advertizing across its numerous publications. But could the success of the anti-fur movement be fueling a plume boom?\n \n\n   \n  “Fashion designers are definitely using ostrich feathers as an alternative to fur, but it’s an ill informed decision to do so,” said Emma Håkansson, founder of ethical fashion activist group Collective Fashion Justice, in a phone interview. “Because we don’t want to kill animals specifically for fashion, we’re just replicating that same problem with a different species here.” Despite the fact ostrich feathers can be harvested without slaughtering, Collective Fashion Justice  published research  in 2023 that found all ostrich feather production systems ultimately kill the bird.\n \n\n   \n  It was Håkansson and her team who worked with Copenhagen Fashion Week to ban all wildlife materials on its runways in 2024, and who convinced the British Fashion Council to prohibit the use of fur and exotic animal skins later that year. Currently they are lobbying organizers at New York, Paris and Milan to commit to similar bans, and Håkansson is “hopeful” that their dialogue will lead to action.\n \n\n   \n  But change needs innovation, as well as restriction, to stick. One of the most feather-filled shows of the Spring-Summer 2026 season came from Stella McCartney. According to the fashion house, the plant-based “Fevvers” used to adorn dresses are the world’s “first ethical alternative” to bird feathers. Inventors Nicola Woollon and James West, who have protected the technology with a strict Non Disclosure Agreement, used Stella McCartney’s runway as a proof of concept. The idea, they told CNN, only took a few intense months of development.\n \n\n   \n  “With so many brands trying to move beyond animal-derived materials, it felt like the right moment to reimagine something so loaded with history and emotion,” Woollen told CNN in an email. “The conversation around materials has mostly focused on leather and fur. Feathers slipped through the next, and we wanted to change that,” West added.\n \n\n   \n  Their first foray into faux feathers took inspiration from ostrich — the final frontier animal campaigners couldn’t restrict over 100 years ago. “Ostrich feathers are the ones most associated with couture and cruelty in equal measure. We wanted to reclaim that form and give it new meaning,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the feather-filled runways of the latest season, it’s developments like Fevvers that keep Håkansson going. “What I hope people come to realize is that having policies in place that make fashion more ethical and sustainable is not restrictive of creativity,” she said. “It actually helps to produce more of it, because you have to think outside the box a bit more.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/food-banks-snap-funding-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Food banks face a ‘perfect storm’ of surging demand as shutdown drags on","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 'perfect storm' of rising food insecurity is threatening millions of Americans as the federal government shutdown continues and the suspension of SNAP benefits looms in November.

Meanwhile, a Florida charity is giving out 300,000 meals per day but, an official there says, “still it’s not enough.”\n \n\n   \n  After a nearly monthlong  government shutdown , the looming  suspension of federal food benefits  in November is poised to put millions of Americans at risk of going hungry — and food banks and other charities across the country face a bleak outlook as they head into a busy holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen large and small charitable nonprofits told CNN they have exceeded their ability to help and warned that the level of support they can provide will fall far short.\n \n\n   \n  “The real impacts are starting now,” said Brian Greene, CEO of Houston Food Bank. “There’s been some uptick, but nowhere near what we’re going to see by the time we get to early November. … it’s going to be unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  With Thanksgiving just weeks away, hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay are becoming new faces at food banks and other charities, which are also bracing for more demand as the Trump administration signals that it doesn’t have the funds to provide food stamps to nearly 42 million Americans next month.\n \n\n   \n  Those factors combine to form a “perfect storm” that will push charities past their brink, said Miette Michie, a board member of the Emergency Food Network, which serves parts of central Virginia. The volunteer-based food distribution site has consistently been at capacity since the shutdown began, Michie said — at which point all the volunteers can do is tell people to call back the next day.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes you angry. … You’re messing with people’s lives here,” Michie told CNN. “This is not just a game, it’s actual people, working people, whose lives are being affected by this.”\n \n\n   \n  Dave Silbert, who leads So What Else, a food bank in Washington, DC, told CNN that “it’s brought a level of chaos and uncertainty.”\n \n\n   \n  “How do we expand?” he asked. “How do we go from 450,000 pounds of food to 550 or 600,000 pounds of food a week? How do we go from raising $300,000 a month to $400,000 a month?”\n \n\n   \n    States rush to provide support\n \n\n   \n  States across the country are working to fill the gap on their own.\n \n\n   \n  California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster have deployed their state’s National Guard troops to support food banks, and Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican,  has signaled he’s prepared  to do so as well.\n \n\n   \n  New Mexico, Minnesota, Washington and West Virginia have announced millions in funding to support relief programs, while Virginia, home to tens of thousands of federal workers, is setting up its own food-assistance system for residents who receive SNAP benefits. That program is expected to cost $37.5 million a week and can be funded through November from the state’s surplus, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  But not every state is able to match federal funding. Several nonprofit directors told CNN that food banks were always meant to supplement, not replace, federal aid programs and that the timing of this influx of need will only further stretch social safety nets.\n \n\n   \n  Residents in Georgia, for example, receive about $250 million in SNAP benefits monthly. Food banks distribute only about $4.5 million worth of food each month, said Amy Breitmann, the CEO Golden Harvest Food Bank, which serves 24 counties in that state and South Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  “The food bank is supposed to be the safety net underneath SNAP, right?” Breitmann said. “It’s not supposed to replace that.”\n \n\n   \n    Food banks already reeling from federal cuts\n \n\n   \n  The surge in demand at food banks across the country comes months after the Trump administration terminated millions  in funding for a program  that allowed food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Higgerson, Chief Development Officer of Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida, said that there’s been “an erosion of the federal food support,” over the past year. A quarter of the food the Second Harvest Food Bank distributes comes from the Emergency Food Assistance Program, he explained.\n \n\n   \n  Between the shutdown and an already-lost millions of dollars from federal budget cuts this year, the situation is “unprecedented” for the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, a charity that has scrambled to launch pop-up shops in areas with the most SNAP-reliant and federal-worker-heavy communities, said president and CEO Amy Beros. Her group lost $2 million when the local food purchasing program was cut earlier this year and had roughly 80 truckloads cancelled from the Emergency Food Assistance Program.\n \n\n   \n  “We know there’s no way for the food banks to fully fill the gap,” Beros said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/europe/louvre-heist-suspects-investigation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:56:00Z","title":"Louvre Heist Suspects Admit Involvement in Jewels Theft","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two suspects, a 34-year-old Algerian national and a 39-year-old illegal taxi and delivery driver from Paris, have admitted partial involvement in a brazen daylight heist at the Louvre Museum’s Apollo Gallery on October 19, 2025.

theft of France’s crown jewels from the Louvre museum have admitted involvement in  the heist  and have been remanded in custody, the Paris prosecutor’s office said on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The Paris prosecutor also said the  stolen jewels  are not in the authorities’ possession.\n \n\n   \n  Both suspects were presented before an investigative judge on Wednesday and placed under formal investigation for organized theft and criminal conspiracy, according to Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau. The pair had “partially admitted” their involvement under questioning, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The heist – a brazen, seven-minute daylight raid on the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery – captured the world’s attention after thieves escaped with jewels worth tens of millions.\n \n\n   \n  The two men were arrested Saturday evening and held in custody, where they were questioned for 96 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Police arrested a third suspect in the Paris region on Wednesday evening, CNN affiliate BFM TV reported on Thursday, citing sources. That suspect was in police custody, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  The first suspect, 34, is of Algerian nationality. He had prior records for traffic-related offenses and was identified through DNA recovered from one of the scooters.\n \n\n   \n  The second suspect, 39, is an illegal taxi driver and delivery driver born in Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris. He was previously known to police for aggravated theft. His DNA was found on glass that had been broken from one of the display cases, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  “There is nothing to suggest that the four perpetrators benefited from any form of inside help within the museum,” Beccuau. said in a Wednesday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  The crime of theft as part of an organized gang carries a potential 15-year prison sentence and a heavy fine, the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  More than 100 investigators have been involved in the manhunt, and authorities were able to track down the individuals after analyzing more than 150 DNA samples and examining several items the group left behind, such as gloves, a helmet and high-vis jackets left at the scene.\n \n\n   \n  One of the men was arrested at Charles de Gaulle Airport as he attempted to leave the country. He was stopped during a passport check before he could board an evening flight to Algeria.\n \n\n   \n  The stolen jewels – among them an emerald necklace set with more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife – were not recovered during the arrests.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves raided the Apollo Gallery on the Louvre’s upper floor, which houses the French Crown Jewels, on October 19. They used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the museum, through a window. They broke into two high-security display cases and made off with nine items, including a diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.\n \n\n   \n  The jewelry taken from the museum is estimated to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million).\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to keep the hope that they will be found and could be returned to the Louvre museum and the nation,” Beccuau added. “These jewels are now unsellable. Anyone who buys them would be guilty of the offence of handling stolen goods. There is still time to return them.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Niamh Kennedy contributed to this report.

North Koreans don’t seem to care \n       \n  Analysis by Will Ripley, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:52 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President Donald Trump  danced on the tarmac  in Malaysia,  met Japan’s emperor  in Tokyo, and  accepted a gold crown  in South Korea, one key question kept following him – would he hold a surprise meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un?\n \n\n   \n  On several occasions  Trump made public overtures  that he’d “love” to meet Kim while in the region. It could have been a made-for-TV sequel to his  surprise 2019 visit at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) , when Trump made history as the first sitting US president to step foot on North Korean soil.\n \n\n   \n  In the end it never came together. And in Pyongyang, just a few hundred miles away, it was like Trump’s trip never happened.\n \n\n   \n  There were no headlines. No television news reports. No mention of the US president’s offer to “work very hard with Kim Jong Un” to bring peace to the Korean peninsula. Even as Trump’s entourage rolled through Asia and speculation swirled about a possible reunion between the two leaders, North Korean state media stayed silent.\n \n\n   \n  American filmmaker and manager at  Young Pioneer Tours  Justin Martell just returned from an eight-day trip to Pyongyang, where he was attending an international film festival that happened to coincide with much of Trump’s Asia trip.\n \n\n   \n  He said most people he spoke with in Pyongyang didn’t even know Trump was in the region, and none were aware that Trump wanted to meet Kim again.\n \n\n   \n  “They weren’t negative about it,” he told CNN. “They weren’t overly hopeful either. They just kept repeating Kim Jong Un’s recent remarks — that while he has warm memories of President Trump, politics are different from feelings.”\n \n\n   \n  Martell said the tone wasn’t hostile, just detached. “It was more or less, ‘Here’s how we feel right now. If it happens, great. If not, it doesn’t really change much.’”\n \n\n   \n  That matter-of-fact indifference marks a striking change from 2018 and 2019, when Trump’s summits with Kim — first in Singapore, then in Hanoi, and later at the DMZ — gripped both capitals and dominated global headlines.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward to 2025 and Trump’s overtures barely registered. But there’s good reason for that.\n \n\n   \n  Only last month Kim stood side-by-side with China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin in the heart of Beijing at a historic military parade in an unprecedented and  historic show of unity  against the West.\n \n\n   \n  Kim now has Moscow for weapons deals and oil, Beijing for trade, and a domestic narrative of resilience under sanctions and  heroism on the battlefield in Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  Frankly, a handshake with the US president no longer carries the weight it once did.\n \n\n   \n    Why the meeting didn’t happen\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the missed meeting with Kim was  “a matter of timing.” \n \n\n   \n  “We never were able to talk because… look I was so busy,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Thursday after departing South Korea and ending his Asia tour.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was also away on a diplomatic mission of her own this week. She first flew to Russia for a  meeting with Putin  to discuss strengthening ties before speaking at an international forum in Belarus.\n \n\n   \n  That made it logistically impossible for North Korea’s top diplomat to help arrange any last-minute meeting between Kim and Trump  as she did in 2019 , when Choe helped pull together the DMZ meeting just hours after  Trump posted on social media  he wanted to meet Kim.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, North Korea test-fired cruise missiles to the west of the Korean peninsula ahead of Trump’s visit, during which he held a summit with South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung.\n \n\n   \n  But as Martell’s conversations in Pyongyang suggest, timing may be only part of the story. North Korea simply may no longer feel strongly compelled to say yes.\n \n\n   \n  Kim has made his terms clear: he’ll meet Trump only if Washington abandons what he calls its  “absurd obsession” with denuclearization . In a September speech, he said he still has “fond memories” of Trump, but that his country “will never trade away nuclear weapons to be free of sanctions.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words, the deal Trump offered six years ago – trading sanctions relief for disarmament – is no longer on the table. North Korea wants to be recognized as a nuclear-armed state.\n \n\n   \n  What Martell saw in Pyongyang underscores why.\n \n\n   \n  The North Korean elite in Pyongyang – whose support is crucial to maintaining national stability, despite Kim’s near-absolute power – appear to be enjoying a higher living standard than previously, with more access to modern technology and amenities. For the elite, at least, sanctions have done little to dent their lives.\n \n\n   \n  Even South Korea’s President Lee seems to recognize the challenges in bringing Kim to the table.\n \n\n   \n   In an interview with me this week , Lee said he hopes Trump can act as a “peacemaker,” while Seoul plays “pacemaker” — creating the conditions for dialogue that remain “difficult” to achieve directly. “If the two leaders of the United States and North Korea could suddenly get together,” Lee said, “we would welcome such engagement.”\n \n\n   \n    High-rises and traffic jams in ‘Pyonghattan’\n \n\n   \n  Martell had not been to Pyongyang since 2017. The capital’s development over the past eight years, despite sanctions and the extreme isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic, stunned him.\n \n\n   \n  “It used to feel much less developed compared to others in the region,” he said. “Now, honestly, Pyongyang feels very much like a modern city.”\n \n\n   \n  He described futuristic high-rises, residents paying with QR codes, new domestic apps for ordering taxis and food, and social media.\n \n\n   \n  “What used to take twenty minutes now takes forty,” he said, referring to the traffic. “We kept joking with our Korean guides that it was Pyonghattan” because it has developed so much.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the capital’s new Hwasong district, he dined at sleek restaurants offering both Asian and Western menus, with high-end liquor on display. He says all the restaurants were full of locals dining when he visited.\n \n\n   \n  Private car ownership was once rare and politically sensitive. Now, it’s common enough to cause occasional traffic jams in busy areas. “There seems to be a burgeoning middle class now,” Martell said.\n \n\n   \n  Even outside the capital, he saw evidence of growth. Traveling two hours north to Mount Myohyang, he noticed new housing under construction. “For farmers, too,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite sanctions, he said, “the DPRK seems to be in a much different position than it was ten years ago.”\n \n\n   \n  At a national gallery near Kim Il Sung Square, he saw new murals commemorating 80 years of the Workers’ Party.

Democrats out of a briefing on US military strikes, top Senate Dem says \n       \n  By Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Natasha Bertrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:50 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Trump administration officials briefed Republicans on Wednesday about  US military strikes on suspected drug boats  without telling Democratic members about the briefing, according to a top Senate Democrat and a source with direct knowledge of the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner slammed the Trump administration for cutting out Democratic lawmakers Wednesday, calling the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”\n \n\n   \n  During the briefing, administration officials showed the Republicans a classified Justice Department OLC memo outlining the administration’s legal justification for the strikes, which CNN  first reported  on earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Warner said, “shutting Democrats out of a briefing on U.S. military strikes and withholding the legal justification for those strikes from half the Senate is indefensible and dangerous.”\n \n\n   \n  “Decisions about the use of American military force are not campaign strategy sessions, and they are not the private property of one political party,” he said. “For any administration to treat them that way erodes our national security and flies in the face of Congress’ constitutional obligation to oversee matters of war and peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “It also sets a reckless and deeply troubling precedent,” the Virginia Democrat continued, adding that the administration should immediately provide Democrats the same briefing and the OLC opinion.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Warner’s comments come as the Trump administration accelerates its attacks against boats that they allege are involved in drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that the US military  conducted another strike against a vessel  in the Pacific Ocean that day, killing four people.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  The action marks the 14th known US military strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel. The operations have killed 61 people aboard 15 total boats.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration told CNN earlier this week that it has provided  seven separate classified briefings  on US military strikes on alleged drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  But some lawmakers have said they have not received the information they want. One Democratic Senate aide told CNN that the administration “appears to be counting the same briefing given multiple times to certain staff or members (including in small groups.) So seven briefings is highly misleading.”\n \n\n   \n  House Armed Services Committee members are expected to get a classified briefing from Pentagon officials on Thursday about the recent US military strikes on boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking, two sources told CNN earlier Wednesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/chicago-immigration-gregory-bovino-appeal-granted","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-04:00","title":"Top Border Patrol official to be deposed Thursday over agency’s tactics in the Chicago area","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is scheduled to undergo a deposition in a lawsuit challenging the aggressive tactics of federal agents during Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago.

 \n  By Devan Cole, Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to sit for a deposition Thursday morning in a lawsuit over his agency’s immigration enforcement tactics in the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The debrief from plaintiff’s attorneys, who accuse federal agents of aggressive behavior against peaceful protesters, is scheduled to last up to five hours. It comes a day after an appeals court halted a judge’s order requiring him to  provide her daily court briefings  on his agents’ activities.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise order Wednesday came just hours before Bovino was meant to brief US District Judge Sara Ellis, who told him Tuesday he must be in court every weekday for the next week as she considers reports that federal agents were not following her order to limit aggressive tactics and warn protesters and journalists before using tear gas and less-lethal munitions.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration quickly pressed a federal appeals court to put her order on hold, arguing that Bovino having to appear would be “extraordinarily disruptive” and “irreparably harming the government.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’ requirement “significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis,” the Justice Department argued.\n \n\n   \n  In a Wednesday afternoon ruling, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted their request, meaning Bovino did not make an appearance in court Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  As the Trump administration carries out targeted immigration enforcement in several major US cities, Bovino has emerged as the  on-the-ground face  of “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago. The targeted operation has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests since it began in September, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n  But the operation has also drawn persistent protests outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, just outside Chicago. While federal agents say threatening protest activity has led them to intensify their crowd control tactics, demonstrators argue their response is often disproportionate.\n \n\n   \n  The appeals court’s decision is intended to give the intermediate court time to review a request from the Trump administration to completely scrap Ellis’ order regarding Bovino.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the Wednesday ruling, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it is “thrilled this act of judicial overreach has been paused.”\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear whether Bovino will appear in court to brief the judge Thursday.   \n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, a group of protesters, local journalists and clergy members sued the Trump administration, accusing federal agents of shooting pepper balls and tear gas at demonstrators without warning and unlawfully restricting the press.\n \n\n   \n  Before the appeals court ruling, Bovino told Fox News he was anticipating the meetings with the judge.\n \n\n   \n  “If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s gonna have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino said on Fox’s  “The Faulkner Focus”  on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino appeared before Ellis on Tuesday after the plaintiffs accused him of  throwing a tear gas canister  into a crowd of demonstrators without justification or warning – a characterization DHS has refuted.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’  restraining order , which applies to the entire Northern District of Illinois, blocks federal agents from using tear gas and less-lethal munitions on protesters unless there is an “immediate threat to safety.” It also requires clear warnings before these methods are used.\n \n\n   \n  During Tuesday’s hearing, Ellis expressed concern that her order was not being followed. She cited videos of interactions between agents and crowds, which she said appeared to show agents firing gas without notice and with no apparent threat.\n \n\n   \n  “Halloween is on Friday,” Ellis said Tuesday. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge provided guidance on how agents should comply with the order, including wearing body cameras to document interactions, wearing visible identification and providing clear warnings before deploying gas.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis ordered that all use-of-force reports and body camera footage during those interactions for Operation Midway Blitz from September 2 through last Satur﻿day be turned over to the court under seal by the end of this week.\n \n\n   \n  A hearing to determine whether Ellis should convert her temporary restraining order into a longer-lasting preliminary injunction is scheduled for next week.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/redistricting-rebellion-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Both Democratic and GOP-led states are starting to rebel against the national redistricting push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the lead-up to the 2026 congressional elections, both Democratic and Republican-led states are actively engaging in mid-decade redistricting efforts, driven by national political pressure—especially from President Donald Trump.

GOP leaders this week were working to secure the signatures from two-thirds of lawmakers in both chambers needed to bypass the state’s Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and proceed. On the line: the US House seat currently held by four-term Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s terrible for democracy,” said Kansas state Rep. Mark Schreiber, one of the remaining Republican holdouts, in an interview with CNN. “It’s fairly simple: Redistricting was meant to accommodate changes in the population, based on the decennial census, and that’s it.”\n \n\n   \n  “This mid-cycle redistricting is being done only for political purposes, in this case to maintain a Republican majority in the US House,” Schreiber added. “I don’t think that’s an appropriate use.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also have faced resistance as they ramp up their redistricting campaign. In Maryland, for instance, a top Democratic lawmaker has balked at taking up map-drawing, warning it will only escalate the ongoing redistricting arms race and help Republicans in the end. National Democrats are seeking changes to maps in at least three other states: New York, Virginia and Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections. If Democrats gain three seats next year, they will win the House and obtain the power to block parts of President Donald Trump’s agenda. But Republicans have more opportunities than Democrats do to shape the election outcome through congressional mapmaking.\n \n\n   \n  So far, GOP lawmakers have redrawn seats in three states – Texas, Missouri and North Carolina – to add a  total of seven potential seats  to the Republican column.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the Democrats’ push\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political operation instigated the political arms race this year when they persuaded Texas to undertake redistricting and create five additional GOP-friendly seats. Next week, California voters will decide whether to counter that and  approve five additional Democratic-friendly seats , representing the largest tranche of seats Democrats can secure through a map change in a single state.\n \n\n   \n  The states now eyeing new maps represent “the third-tier opportunities for redistricting,” said Jacob Rubashkin, deputy editor of Inside Elections, an independent political newsletter. But, he said, “in order to squeeze an advantage, you have to go piecemeal once you get beyond the big hitters. For Democrats, especially, California is all they have.”\n \n\n   \n  Virginia, a purple state where Democrats hold the majorities in both chambers of the legislature, is potentially the biggest remaining redistricting prize for the party. Democrats currently hold six of the state’s 11 seats in the US House, and an aggressive map redraw could potentially give the party nine or 10 seats.\n \n\n   \n  But it will take a monthslong effort to get there as lawmakers tackle multiple hurdles to bypass the redistricting process the state established five years ago. Under current law, the power to redistrict rests with a bipartisan redistricting commission created by voters through a constitutional amendment.\n \n\n   \n  First, Democrats must pass language to amend the state constitution before Tuesday’s elections for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 seats in the House of Delegates. Then, it must be approved again next year in a second legislative session before voters have their say in a statewide referendum.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Republicans have signaled that they intend to mount legal challenges to any action by the legislature, arguing that Democrats already have run afoul of a requirement to pass the proposed constitutional amendment before the election since early voting is underway.\n \n\n   \n  The US House’s top Democrat, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, is working to persuade Illinois lawmakers to eke out an additional seat there, despite objections from the head of the state Senate’s Black caucus. In Jeffries’ home state of New York, a  new lawsuit  by a leading Democratic-aligned elections firm takes aim at the sole Republican-held seat in New York City.\n \n\n   \n  After meeting with Jeffries this week, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch said in a statement that “all options must remain on the table to protect our democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  But at least one Democrat in the state – state Sen. Willie Preston, who heads the Black caucus in his chamber – has opposed it, arguing the new map risks diluting Black political power in the state. Preston is running for a US House seat now held by Rep. Robin Kelly. Kelly is running for an open US Senate seat to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin.\n \n\n   \n  “Black Democrats have given our all to our party - the answer to fighting back against Trump’s efforts to crush Black political power cannot be diluting Black political power,” Preston said in statement.\n \n\n   \n  In deep-blue Maryland, the state Senate President William Ferguson has publicly opposed map-drawing targeting the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation. But other Democrats, including Jeffries, insisted Wednesday that redistricting remains a viable option in the state.\n \n\n   \n    Rare GOP resistance to Trump\n \n\n   \n  For Republicans, the most immediate battleground is Indiana, where GOP Gov. Mike Braun has announced a special legislative session starting next week to tackle a redistricting plan that could possibly yield two more seats for his party – although it’s uncertain that the plan has enough support among Republicans in the state Senate majority to succeed.\n \n\n   \n  Some Indiana Republicans have been among those resisting Trump’s moves, despite significant lobbying by the president and two visits to the state by Vice President JD Vance. Braun, a staunch Trump ally, has called legislators back to the statehouse to start working on a redraw next week.\n \n\n   \n  But on the same day that Braun announced the legislative session, Molly Swigart, a spokeswoman for the top Republican in the state Senate, said there still were not enough Republican votes to support redistricting in that chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Wednesday for an update, Swigart   responded: “I do not have anything new to share.”\n \n\n   \n  Prominent Republicans in the state, including former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, have opposed the redistricting. Under the current map, the GOP holds seven of the state’s nine US House seats.\n \n\n   \n  In a  recent Washington Post column , Daniels said the current map is fair and urged Republicans in the Hoosier State to continue to resist. “Someone has to lead in climbing out of this mudhole,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “We generally pride ourselves in doing what’s right, not what’s easy,” Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and former Indiana lawmaker, told CNN. “We take our time. We weigh things.”\n \n\n   \n  In another Republican-controlled state, Louisiana lawmakers this week took steps that could give their party an edge next year. Legislators voted to delay the state’s 2026 primary elections by a month to give them more time to draw new congressional lines if the US Supreme Court decides a redistricting case in the state’s favor.\n \n\n   \n    ‘An incredible Pandora’s box’\n \n\n   \n  While Republicans have structural advantages that allow them to rack up more seats through redistricting than Democrats can, Rubashkin of Inside Elections said the final outcome of the ongoing redistricting battle is unclear, particularly if next year becomes a wave election for Democrats, akin to 2018 midterm elections when the party gained more than 40 House seats during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  “If the partisan, national environment is favorable enough to one party or the other, you cannot redistrict your way into the majority,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  However, Rubashkin added, the redistricting push now underway likely has changed US politics, by opening “an incredible Pandora’s box … that will persist long after this election cycle. I don’t see what will stop states that have the capacity from simply redrawing every two years.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/three-star-pushed-out-by-hegseth-caine-over-tensions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"09:45:00-20:00","title":"Exclusive: Three-star general pushed out amid tensions with Hegseth","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A three-star general, Lt.

Joe McGee, the director for Strategy, Plans, and Policy on the Joint Staff, left his position earlier this month, the sources said. They added that McGee had frequently “pushed back” against Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine on issues ranging from Russia and Ukraine to military operations in the Caribbean. The sources noted that McGee was nominated by former President Joe Biden nearly a year ago for a promotion to serve as director of the Joint Staff but was never renominated by the current administration.\n \n\n   \n  McGee’s primary responsibility in the role was to advise Caine on long-term military strategy including weighing the risks of potential actions and planning for crisis contingencies.\n \n\n   \n  “He has had a target on his back for a while now,” one of the sources said of McGee.

JP McGee will retire after nearly three years of outstanding leadership and service on the Joint Staff.

Alvin Holsey, have been allowed to retire, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Holsey offered to resign amid stark disagreements with Hegseth and Caine over the legality of the US military’s strikes on suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean, CNN has reported. Like with McGee, Hegseth had been frustrated that Holsey tended to move too slowly and saw him as an obstacle, according to sources.

The operations, which began in early September, have  killed 61 people aboard 15 total boats .\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has been accelerating its attacks against boats that they allege are involved in drug trafficking. Last week, the administration  struck two boats  in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which appeared to mark an expansion of its campaign as previous strikes had targeted vessels in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the US military struck four more boats in the Pacific, killing 14 people with one survivor, Hegseth announced a day later.\n \n\n   \n  Those strikes marked the first time multiple were conducted on the same day as part of Trump’s campaign against drug cartels and trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers,  CNN previously reported .

Wayne Chang, Will Ripley, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:45 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Days before President  Donald Trump  departed for Asia where he will sit down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday for their first in-person meeting of his second term, the president refused to count out the possibility of America’s position on Taiwan getting tangled in US-China trade talks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to be talking about a lot of things. I assume that’s going to be one of the things, but I’m not going to talk about that now,” Trump said when asked about reports that China may pressure the US to oppose Taiwan’s independence in exchange for a larger trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  The refusal to definitively count out Taiwan becoming a pawn in trade talks between the world’s two largest economies comes as Trump has privately and publicly suggested he believes China will not invade the self-ruled island that Beijing claims it owns while he is in office – raising questions about how seriously the president will prioritize boosting Taiwan’s defense during his second term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump again gave an evasive answer on Taiwan as he spoke with reporters on Air Force One en route to South Korea Wednesday for the Asia-Pacific Cooperation summit where he will sit down with Xi, saying he is  not even sure  the topic will be raised by the Chinese leader. A senior administration official expressed confidence that Trump would not be backed into stating opposition to Taiwan’s independence during the meeting, adding that the meeting will be focused on Xi “holding a gun to the head of the global economy” with its critical mineral export controls.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said over the weekend that no one in the administration is contemplating a trade deal that includes “favorable treatment” for walking away from Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Some experts remain worried, however, that Trump might be willing to make concessions on Taiwan for a better trade deal, but former Trump administration officials argue that those concerns are over-blown.\n \n\n   \n  “That idea of a grand bargain, of Trump selling out Taiwan, gets most of its oxygen from Chinese Communist Party trial balloons that are floated in US media, and from isolationists on the far left and the far right who believe in appeasement,”   said Matt Pottinger, Chairman of the China Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and Trump’s former deputy national security advisor. “Trump understands the strategic nature of Taiwan.”\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan is also publicly downplaying concerns about the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting, and with a senior Taiwan government official saying they are “cautiously optimistic” about the meeting and pointing to Rubio’s latest remarks as an encouraging sign.\n \n\n   \n  Whenever leaders of the United States and China meet, Taiwan’s government is closely watching and calibrating its own strategy. Very little is typically said publicly given the precarious position Taipei finds itself in – wedged between two superpowers with vastly conflicting agendas and interests.\n \n\n   \n  And Taiwan’s anxieties have amplified in Trump’s second term, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s team is filled with more isolationist and far-right figures than the establishment Republican and Democratic officials who have traditionally shaped US foreign policy. And while Trump has prioritized securing a major trade deal with Beijing, his administration has paused some US military support to the island and complicated basic engagements such as the transit of Taiwan’s president through the US earlier this year, current and former US officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Some stakeholders in Taipei have found it really jarring to be in this position where they’re suddenly so unclear on whether the US president will support them,” said Henrietta Levin, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), adding they have found an “unwelcome surprise” in how challenging it has been to bolster the US-Taiwan relationship this year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went into his first term having taken a phone call from Taiwan’s president  during the transition,  which upended protocol because there are no formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Taiwan. His administration then accelerated the sale of weapons to the self-governing island and allowed the transit of Taiwan’s president though the US on multiple occasions – which is in line with past norms.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, Trump came into office for his second term after having repeatedly claimed in recent years that Taiwan “stole” the US chip business, which resonated uneasily in Taipei. He has been careful in public statements about Taiwan, his administration has halted the flow of some weapons from US stockpiles to the island and complicated the transit of the island’s president through the US.\n \n\n   \n    The return of strategic ambiguity, or a downgrade of the relationship?\n \n\n   \n  Some experts make the case that to date, Trump in his second term has acted in line with decades of US policy with a return to strategic ambiguity.\n \n\n   \n  While it may be a hard shift after former President Joe Biden declared multiple times while he was in office that the US would militarily defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion, they say it’s not an abnormal approach.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at Obama, Bush before that, it’s always been a little bit of a hands-off approach, and trying to keep Taiwan at arm’s length and being very careful about any messages you sent to China. So, we are somewhat back to that new normal again,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, the chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a foreign policy think tank.\n \n\n   \n  But Taiwan is grappling with whether the current state of the relationship with the US is a short-term aberration as Trump focuses on a productive meeting with Xi, or more of a long-term reality.\n \n\n   \n  It has led them to parse over the deeper meaning of every single engagement with the administration – or lack thereof.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this fall, there was a gathering on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly with Taiwan’s foreign minister at Le Bernardin, an upscale New York restaurant. Multiple senior US administration officials were expected to attend but they didn’t show up, according to a source who attended the gathering. Even though the administration signaled through intermediaries that the no-show was simply the unintended consequence of over-packed schedules, it left Taiwan feeling defeated, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The island is actively re-evaluating how they can move to bring the Trump administration to their side, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Facing pressure from both Washington and Beijing, President Lai Ching-te has pledged to raise defense spending sharply to 3.32% of GDP by 2026 and 5% by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  But there are also actions that are being taken – or considered – that won’t attract headlines but could impact the overall relationship.\n \n\n   \n  One option being considered is recalling their de facto ambassador to the US Alexander Yui in order to replace him with a diplomat who is more politically savvy, sources said. Some Trump administration officials have said that the current career diplomat doesn’t have the juice to effectively engage despite support from some close to the president, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan flatly denied that suggestion on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Taiwan and the US maintains a smooth communication channel,” Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung, told a legislative committee meeting. “Our representative office in the US has been functioning well. We are not recalling him.”\n \n\n   \n  Taipei has also launched an unprecedented charm offensive aimed at conservative media figures and influencers aligned with Trump’s movement.\n \n\n   \n  President Lai granted  a rare interview  to radio host Buck Sexton, praising Trump and even suggesting he would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if he could persuade China to renounce the use of force against Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President  Hsiao Bi-khim spoke with  YouTuber Shawn Ryan, while Taiwan’s de facto ambassador appeared on Steve Bannon’s podcast and hosted Ryan at Twin Oaks, the historic ambassadorial residence in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  Such outreach marks a sharp departure from Taipei’s conventional diplomatic approach, underscoring its effort to engage directly with the Trump-aligned ecosystem currently shaping US foreign policy discourse.\n \n\n   \n  Taipei is also trying to offset its US trade deficit by purchasing 6 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Alaska, a move officials describe as both an energy-security measure and a goodwill gesture toward Washington while they are still working on a trade deal between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Taiwan is not willing to concede to the US across the board. The island   vowed  to resist pressure  from Washington to shift half of its chip production capacity to the United States, throwing down the gauntlet to the Trump administration just earlier this month. The subject is expected to continue as an active piece of the ongoing trade talks between the US and Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n    Making Taiwan a porcupine ‘without giving Beijing the middle finger’\n \n\n   \n  Chinese leader Xi Jinping views Taiwan’s “reunification” with the mainland as a core requirement for the sweeping vision of a “national rejuvenation” China aims to achieve by mid-century.\n \n\n   \n  Senior Communist Party officials recently drew up their upcoming five-year plan, which analysts expect will see Beijing prioritize greater economic integration with Taiwan as part of its push for “peaceful reunification.” State media on Monday released a sweeping commentary laying out the many economic carrots it said would be available to Taiwan’s people “after reunification.”\n \n\n   \n  China’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it, and has not ruled out using force to take control of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US officials have said that Xi has ordered the country’s military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration plans to adopt a policy on Taiwan with the goal of making the island a “porcupine” by investing strategically in precision and smaller weapons built for asymmetric warfare to deter Chinese aggression or make an invasion so costly and painful that costs would outweigh benefits, two sources briefed on the policy discussions said. US officials also want to get Taiwan to that place “without giving Beijing the middle finger,” the sources explained.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration refused to green-light the transfer of US weapons stocks to Taiwan earlier this year, under a process known as Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), sources said. The move led to questions about the US military’s commitment to Taiwan. But the move was not meant to signal a complete abdication of US support, sources said. While the administration does not want Taiwan pulling from US weapons stocks — with one administration official pointing out that most of the stockpiled weapons that the US can give to Taiwan would be ineffective in a fight against China — there are no plans to halt sales of weapons which would be purchased by Taiwan, administration officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Taiwan to put in more orders for military equipment, and they are still waiting on those new orders, the senior administration official said. This private push comes as the administration has made clear that it views the economically prosperous island through the same lens that it views Europe – that it must invest more towards its own defense.\n \n\n   \n  Still, speed needs to be addressed. Taipei is waiting on a backlog of more than $20 billion in undelivered US military equipment, with production times in the US delayed in part because of the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the delayed National Defense Strategy from the Pentagon and internal disagreement over the extent to which the administration plans to prioritize sending military resources to the Western Hemisphere and Europe versus the Pacific is raising questions about the military focus and resources that will actually be put towards Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Dictating the flow of US arms to allies and partners would typically be the job of the defense secretary but the Pentagon has tried to make those calls in recent months with policy memos that have at times been slapped down by Trump directly, sources pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has publicly claimed in recent weeks that Xi won’t invade Taiwan because of US military strength.\n \n\n   \n  “China doesn’t want to do that. First of all, United States is the strongest military power in the world by far, it’s not even close,” Trump said earlier this month. “Nobody’s going to mess with that and I don’t see that at all with President Xi.”\n \n\n   \n  While US officials claim Taiwan must act more quickly to shore up its own defenses, there are concerns on the island that Trump’s personal conviction that Xi will not invade while he is in office could impede the US from effectively boosting their military capabilities in the coming years.\n \n\n   \n  “They are concerned about that, so if there’s no invasion until 2029, but all the time between now and then is wasted, both on the US side and the Taiwanese side, that will set us up for a disaster in 2029 or 2030,” Alperovitch said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/shutdown-talks-thune-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00-04:00","title":"Rank-and-file senators engage in ‘shadow negotiation’ in search for shutdown end","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rank-and-file senators from both parties are engaging in informal, behind-the-scenes negotiations—referred to as a 'shadow negotiation'—to resolve the ongoing 29-day government shutdown.

One of their goals is to resolve the impasse on health care and reopen the government for the next few weeks. They are also hoping to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments, including the US Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps, through next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the private conversations that are going on are trying to create like a shadow negotiation, so that we have some clarity about what we need to vote on,” Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, one of those involved in the conversations, told CNN on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But these senators still face an uphill climb to get their warring parties on the same page. Their task has been made more complicated by GOP leaders’ fierce commitment not to negotiate with Democrats on health care until Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his members agree to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Thune appeared to suggest on Wednesday that he would have a conversation with those involved in the negotiations. Asked if he would personally engage with centrist Democrats involved in the talks, Thune told CNN: “I think that will happen pretty soon.”\n \n\n   \n  But his office later told CNN that he remains unwilling to discuss any Obamacare policy changes until the government is open. And Thune stressed he could not guarantee any resolution to Democrats: “I’ve offered up a process. I can’t guarantee an outcome or result,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the emerging talks are a fresh sign of optimism inside a gloomy Capitol building. Finally, after weeks of total gridlock with half of Congress not even present in Washington, there appears to be some movement. The push comes as members of both parties brace for worsening effects of the shutdown, including the lapse of food stamps for the first time in the program’s history starting this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mike Rounds suggested that — if party leaders agreed — the Senate could vote as early as next week on full-year spending bills that would allow Democrats to move on past the current funding fight and pivot to longer-term spending bills.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re focused on - Is there a way for our Democratic colleagues to save face and perhaps not vote directly to a continuing resolution?” Rounds said, referring to the same stopgap bill that Democrats have blocked more than a dozen times. Instead, he said, Republicans would put the bipartisan, full-year spending bills on the floor “as a way around the continuing resolution.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once that’s moving, maybe then we’ll look at a continuing resolution,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers have faced increased pressure to reopen the government this week with  crucial safety net programs  – including federal food assistance for more than 40 million people – at risk of shuttering in the coming days. Thune’s remarks come hours after he and numerous other senators voiced a rare sense of optimism that there could be a way out of the 29-day shutdown. Still, neither side has made any commitments publicly.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s ticked up significantly and hopefully that’ll be a precursor of things to come,” Thune told reporters earlier in the day when asked about the status of talks with rank-and-file Democrats. “But yeah, there’s a lot of higher level of conversation.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders, Thune said, are not involved in the negotiating. Asked whether he thought there would be enough moderate Democrats in the mix to reach a deal that would reopen the government, he expressed optimism.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a possibility that could happen. So, let’s just hope that the conversations continue,” he said, noting he’s “being kept briefed and read-into most of those conversations. I’m hoping something here very soon will be fruitful.”\n \n\n   \n  One Democrat involved in the talks, who requested anonymity to speak on the discussions, told CNN the conversations Thune cited are real. The Democrat would not elaborate on whether they were focused solely on resolving the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies or if other matters – such as the White House’s recent moves to flout Congress’ spending power through “rescissions” – were also involved.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether the talks could offer a way out of the shutdown, the Democrat would only say: “Maybe.”\n \n\n   \n  One component of the ongoing talks – how to win support in the Senate for full-year appropriations bills that would prevent another shutdown cliff in the coming weeks. Two other Democrats involved in the discussions suggested to CNN that they are interested in those long-term bills as part of an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about whether emerging talks involved full year spending bills, Democratic Sen. Gary Peters said he didn’t “want to get into specifics but clearly that would be nice.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, told CNN that “it’s accurate to say we’re pushing for full-year appropriations bills because that’s what we should be doing,” when asked whether the party was pursuing them as a way out of the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen, who has been involved in the talks, declined to confirm Thune’s assessment that they are making progress, but said, “I think there have been good discussions. That’s all I’m going to tell you about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and has been perhaps the most vocal Republican calling for bipartisan talks, told reporters Wednesday that she was “encouraged” by the direction of talks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that there are, have been enough of the pieces that have been talked through that if, if somebody can just diagram out how it all comes together and present that — Yes, I do believe it’s possible to kind of come together quickly,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no great magic in how we get out of this. It’s the same stuff we’ve been talking about for months,” added Murkowski.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, said that he did not think that Republicans had offered anything new in the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  “There have been, there are occasional talks between Democrats and Republicans on this issue, but our Republican colleagues don’t seem to be offering anything different than what their leadership has had so far we hope that will change,” the New York Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t want to pit health care and food.

She hopes Trump can free him in meeting with Xi \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, and CNN staff\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Grace Jin Drexel couldn’t contact her father on October 10, she tried not to panic. She had just heard that one of the pastors of his underground Christian church in  China  had been detained by authorities; maybe he was busy sorting out the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Then her fears were confirmed. Her father, Ezra Jin Mingri, and dozens of other members of Zion Church had been swept up in a mass crackdown across various congregations and Chinese cities – the largest suppression since  a similar wave of arrests in 2018. \n \n\n   \n  Chinese authorities have long seen Christianity as an unwelcome foreign influence and a threat to government control, experts say – and this crackdown sends a particularly stark message, targeting a well-known church that has been shut down once before.\n \n\n   \n  But Drexel and her family, all American citizens living in the US while Jin resided in China, hope a major diplomatic meeting this week might change that.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, US President Donald Trump is  meeting  Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. While trade is expected to dominate the conversation, there are growing calls for Trump to raise the issue of the crackdown and Jin’s detention.\n \n\n   \n  The summit presents “a very unique timing,” said Drexel, who works as a staffer in the US Senate. “We think that the Trump administration’s prioritization of Americans in this scenario also could be helpful for my father as well, to bring a family member of an American citizen home to be with us in the US and safe,” she told CNN on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not publicly commented on the issue, and it’s not clear whether it will be on the agenda on Thursday. Tensions remain high between the US and China, which reached a  framework agreement on trade  this week ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting, after a series of escalatory tariffs imposed on each other.\n \n\n   \n  But Drexel and her family see this as a rare window of opportunity before Jin’s potential indictment for illegally disseminating information online – which, Drexel said, would make his release much harder to negotiate.\n \n\n   \n  She and Jin have some powerful backers, including Secretary of State  Marco Rubio  and members of the  Congressional-Executive Commission on China. \n \n\n   \n  “We must make it clear to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) that the persecution of Christians and other people of faith must stop, and that the United States will use every tool, diplomatic and economic, to hold Chinese Communist officials accountable,” Sen. Ted Cruz said in a video shared by the Hudson Institute think tank, where Drexel’s husband works as a fellow.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, when asked about Rubio’s call for the pastors’ release, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “The Chinese government manages religious affairs in accordance with the law, protecting citizens’ freedom of religious belief and normal religious activities. We firmly oppose the US interfering in China’s internal affairs under the guise of so-called religious issues.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the foreign affairs office in Beihai, where Jin is detained, and to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau for comment.\n \n\n   \n    A string of crackdowns\n \n\n   \n  This crackdown is the latest in a long history of religious suppression in China. Religious practice is legal but tightly controlled and surveilled by the government, which registers “official” state-sanctioned churches.\n \n\n   \n  The government only recognizes five faiths: Chinese Buddhism, Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism and Taoism. Other local spiritual and religious movements have been subject to harsh crackdowns over the years. But that hasn’t stopped communities from creating their own underground, non-registered churches known as “house churches.”\n \n\n   \n  One 44-year-old Christian in Beijing told CNN she’d attended several “house churches,” and had seen plainclothes police officers entering and asking everyone to register themselves.\n \n\n   \n  During previous crackdowns, “when brothers and sisters were arrested, we would all donate money and send someone to visit them in jail and buy them food and clothes,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Zion Church is one such “house church” that the 44-year-old recalled attending in previous years. Jin founded Zion Church in 2007 in Beijing while his family was still living in China; it gradually became one of the largest churches in Beijing, Drexel said.\n \n\n   \n  By 2011, Jin was speaking out about crackdowns on other congregations, in the hopes underground churches might become legally recognized. “We are very aware of what we are doing,” he said in 2011, when he granted CNN rare access to film inside his church. “And we are ready to pay the price.”\n \n\n   \n  That price came in 2018. Drexel described a “pressure campaign” that year, with the government installing facial recognition cameras in the lobby of the church’s building after Jin refused to install them inside the church itself.\n \n\n   \n  Hoping to appease the authorities, Jin and his family moved to the US – and when the harassment toward church members in Beijing continued, Jin decided to return to China later that year while his family stayed behind.\n \n\n   \n  That was the last time most of the family saw Jin. The crackdown came soon after; Zion Church was shut down, and Jin was barred from leaving the country. In Chengdu, more than 100 worshipers from a different church were detained, and its pastor, Wang Yi, was jailed for nine years for “inciting subversion of state power.”\n \n\n   \n  Drexel visited her father in 2019 – and she, too, was prevented from leaving China for 11 months, derailing her plans to attend law school. She was eventually allowed to return to the US but hasn’t seen her father since.\n \n\n   \n  After 2018, Jin transformed Zion Church into a semi-virtual network, uploading sermons online and encouraging members around the country to gather and watch sessions together. When the pandemic hit, Zion was quick to adapt to Zoom – and the church’s membership exploded.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of the CCP’s own policy of locking people up inside their house, and there was nothing to do for people, a lot of people went to church (online), and it was the only place where you could interact with people,” Drexel said, referring to China’s stringent zero-Covid and lockdown policies at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The church became a national organization that now reaches 10,000 people each day, Drexel said. But there were also signs that it was once again under threat; authorities were watching Jin’s movements closely, and even blocked him from traveling to other cities within China. Church members reported an uptick in harassment and intimidation.\n \n\n   \n  A fellow Zion pastor asked Jin earlier this month: “What if this is the big thing, that they arrest everyone? What would happen?”\n \n\n   \n  “My dad did not hesitate one moment, and was not scared,” Drexel said. “He just said immediately, ‘Hallelujah, the gospel will spread further.’”\n \n\n   \n    Why now?\n \n\n   \n  The Zion pastors and church leaders arrested in October are now being kept in two detention centers in the southern city of Beihai, according to Drexel.\n \n\n   \n  Though a few have since been released, close to two dozen remain detained, she said.\n \n\n   \n  All the detainees are “innocent Christians,” the church said in a statement on October 12. “Their only ‘offense’ is worshiping God peacefully, preaching the Gospel faithfully, shepherding their flock, and serving their neighbors. These acts of faith are protected under both the Constitution of China and international human rights law.”\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t just happen to Zion, said Drexel – other underground churches have been targeted, too, including Bitter Winter and Early Rain Covenant Church.\n \n\n   \n  The detainees’ families are deeply worried, she said. Some are elderly with health problems, while others have young children at home. Her father, Jin, has severe diabetes – and while he’s now being provided generic medication, he hasn’t been able to receive the prescription issued by his doctor, she said.\n \n\n   \n  And in a rare development that Drexel credits to the international attention on their case, most of the detainees have been granted legal representation.\n \n\n   \n  Jin’s lawyer said he appears in “relatively good spirits,” said Drexel – he even joked that the bad food in detention was good for controlling his diabetes.\n \n\n   \n  But the stakes are high under China’s opaque judicial system, which legal observers say has a conviction rate around 99%. Wang Yi, the pastor arrested in 2018, is still in prison today.\n \n\n   \n  Drexel is still trying to understand why the CCP under Xi – whose grip on power has tightened since 2018 – is so threatened by “this small group of Christians.”\n \n\n   \n  One theory, she said, points to China’s ongoing economic hardships. Wary of growing public discontent, the government may “try to clamp down on everything, including freedom of speech and other civil and society organizations,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Fenggang Yang, a professor of sociology and director of the Center on Religion and the Global East at Purdue University, partially agreed. While he’s not convinced it has to do with the current economic situation, he emphasized that the churches pose a deep ideological threat to Xi, who has tightened religious regulations since taking office and increasingly emphasized the need to “Sinicize” religions.\n \n\n   \n  “The Chinese authorities always considered Christianity as one of the institutions that pose the greatest challenge – for (starting a) color revolution, for changing people’s attitudes towards the government,” Yang said.\n \n\n   \n  The detainees don’t seem to be a particularly high priority for either Trump or Xi ahead of their meeting, he added.\n \n\n   \n  As the world watches for signs of easing US-China tensions out of their leaders’ high-stakes talks, Drexel has a much simpler wish: she just wants her dad back.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to emphasize that my dad went back to China because he had a deep love for China and Chinese people,” she said. “We want to be able to keep being faithful to our God, as well as to serve our community and serve China.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95841","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:43:00-04:00","title":"King Charles III Strips Prince Andrew of His Titles and Evicts Him from Royal Lodge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III has removed Prince Andrew’s titles, including the title of Prince, and evicted him from Royal Lodge, citing his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations made by survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre.

indicated Thursday she is inclined to take steps to ensure that  federal food assistance  keeps flowing to 42 million Americans who depend on it. Trump administration officials say because of the government shutdown, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, will be cut off on Saturday.  \"The well has run dry,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, posted on  its website . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Democratic governors and attorneys general from some two dozen states  sued the federal government  to keep the payments coming, arguing SNAP benefits are an entitlement that cannot legally be cut off. They also make the case that stopping benefits would cause irreparable harm to millions of Americans, and to the state governments who will be left to deal with the fallout. The Trump administration had argued the opposite; officials say they are legally  prohibited  from extending the benefits by using emergency funds. But after an hour of arguments in Boston federal court Thursday, Judge Indira Talwani wasn't buying it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Congress put money in an emergency fund, and it is hard for me to understand how this is not an emergency,\" Talwani said. \"It's really clear to me that what Congress was trying to do was protect the American people,\" she said, and she believes it was lawmakers intent to ensure that in the event of something like a shutdown, \"we're not going to make everyone drop dead because it's a political game someplace else.\" Even if the emergency fund is tapped for SNAP benefits, administration officials say its $5.5 billion falls short of the $9 billion needed to fully cover the whole month of November. They say recalculating benefits and arranging for partial payments would be a logistical nightmare — and could take weeks. That means millions of Americans would still see some delay in receiving their next benefit, and they would also be receiving less than usual. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590153","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The American dream feels impossible for many young voters, who see no political fix","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing disillusionment among young American voters—particularly Gen Z and millennials—due to economic challenges such as rising housing costs, stagnant wages, and high levels of student and mortgage debt.

Gen Z and millennial Americans are feeling increasingly demoralized about their economic prospects, and some say their concerns have gone unaddressed by elected officials. In communities of all kinds, voters in their 20s and 30s are confronting a financial reality of rising costs, mounting debt and minimal wage growth. But how is this changing their political views? It's a question that NPR  put to readers . We received more than 1,100 submissions from across the political spectrum from almost every state in the U.S. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many described a similar reality — one where economic worries loom large over their everyday lives and erode their faith in the ability of those in power. Taken together, their responses paint a portrait of a generation of voters discouraged by what they see in Washington and who increasingly feel as if they have no political home. It is important to note that the responses are not from a representative sample of all young voters. But what readers shared helps highlight a steep challenge facing Democrats and Republicans alike as they work to win over these voters, who are collectively expected to make up  more than half the electorate in 2028 . Here is a snapshot of what readers shared.  These responses have been edited for clarity and length. Young voters are united in disappointment  Many young Americans feel a collective sense of disillusionment in the political system, and respondents told NPR that their financial struggles are exacerbating that pain. Recent polling seems to underscore the frustrations many shared with NPR. Just a fraction of young voters feel confident in government institutions, with less than 2 in 10 of those 18 to 29 years old saying they trust the federal government to do the right thing most or all of the time, according to the latest  Harvard Youth Poll , from this spring. Similarly, only 16% of those under 30 believe democracy is working well for them,  according to a report  from the young voter research organization, CIRCLE. Their life goals are on hold — for some indefinitely  Young people shared that one of the biggest drivers feeding into their sense of political frustration is the struggle to get ahead financially or even just stay afloat. When asked what economic success looks like for them, respondents didn't want lavish mansions or high-priced sports cars. Instead, their ambitions were more modest, often centering on the need for financial stability. Yet even that felt out of reach for many. Young Americans said goals like owning a home, starting a family or pursuing a dream job feel increasingly like a luxury rather than an achievable milestone. Financial concerns are forcing them to reframe what's possible and sometimes choose one goal over another. Financial roadblocks standing in the way  Many are navigating a unique economic moment where both median home and rental prices, for example, have  risen at a faster pace than wages  for roughly two decades. People are also waiting longer to buy homes. The median age of a first-time homebuyer in 2024 stood at 38, 10 years older than in the early 1990s,  according to the National Association of Realtors . Debt is also a barrier. Despite collectively making up the  largest share of the labor force  and being on track to surpass older generations in  educational attainment , Generation Z and millennials have  higher rates of student loan debt  and more  mortgage debt . Family planning looks different as well. People are deciding to have  fewer children  or not start a family. Last year, the U.S. fertility rate hit a  record low , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They watched their parents succeed, but struggle themselves In the face of financial challenges, respondents say they're struggling to reach or build upon the lifestyle achieved by their parents and grandparents, making some feel less hopeful about the future. Even with hard work and a degree, many readers said they have accomplished less than their parents had by the same age. This has led many to feel disillusioned with, even betrayed by, the very system that promised to set them up for success and stability. Despite losing faith in most politicians, populism resonates Young Americans see very few politicians actively addressing their concerns around affordability, leading some to lose faith in the effectiveness of either major political party. \"Over time, I've come to see our two-party system as two wings on the same bird,\" explained 27-year-old respondent Sophie Howard, from Davenport, Iowa. When asked which politicians are speaking to their concerns, liberal-leaning respondents frequently highlighted progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Zohran Mamdani, the Democrats' nominee for mayor in New York City. Readers on the conservative side often coalesced around President Trump and Vice President Vance. Many respondents returned to the same point: that they're most inspired by populist-style leaders who focus on disrupting the status quo. It's a message that young people say goes past political labels, pushing some to opposite poles on the ideological spectrum and leaving others feeling stuck in the middle. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591978","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-04:00","title":"Trump says Senate should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is urging the Senate to eliminate the filibuster, arguing that it allows Democrats to block Republican efforts to reopen the federal government that has been shut down since October 1, 2025.

EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government. \"THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE 'NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,\" Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began. Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a \"great deal\" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday. Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did \"powerful Republicans allow\" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government. His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight. Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill. \"People are stressing,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce. \"We are well past time to have this behind us.\" While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity — one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat — could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry. Money for military, but not food aid The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program. At the same time, many Americans who purchase their own health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces, with open enrollment also beginning Saturday, are experiencing sticker shock as premium prices jump. \"We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,\" said Rev. Ryan Stoess, during a prayer with religious leaders at the U.S. Capitol. \"God help us,\" he said, \"when the cruelty is the point.\" Deadlines shift to next week The House remains closed down under Johnson for the past month. Senators are preparing to depart Thursday for the long weekend. Trump returns late Thursday after a whirlwind tour of Asia. That means the shutdown, in its 30th day, appears likely to stretch into another week if the filibuster remains. If the shutdown continues, it could become the longest in history, surpassing the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump's first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The next inflection point comes after Tuesday's off-year elections — the New York City mayor's race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states' governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal. \"I hope that it frees people up to move forward with opening the government,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. GOP cut SNAP in Trump's big bill The Republicans, who have majority control of Congress, find themselves in an unusual position, defending the furloughed federal workers and shuttered programs they have long sought to cut — including most recently with nearly $1 trillion in reductions in Trump's big tax breaks and spending bill. Medicaid, the health care program, and SNAP food aid, suffered sizable blows this summer, in part by imposing new work requirements. For SNAP recipients, many of whom were already required to work, the new requirements extend to older Americans up to age 64 and parents of older school-age children. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans now \"have the nerve\" to suggest it's a political strategy to withhold food aid. \"We are trying to lift up the quality of life for the American people,\" Jeffries of New York said about his party. \"The American people understand that there's a Republican health care crisis,\" he said. \"The American people understand Republicans enacted the largest cut to nutritional assistance in American history when they cut $186 billion from their one, big, ugly bill.\" During the summer debate over Trump's big bill, Johnson and other Republicans railed against what they characterized as lazy Americans, riding what the House speaker calls the \"gravy train\" of government benefits. The speaker spoke about able-bodied young men playing video games while receiving Medicaid health care benefits and insisted the new work requirements for the aid programs would weed out what they called \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" \"What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said in spring on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all,\" he said. What remains out of reach, for now, is any relief from the new health care prices, posted this week, that are expected to put insurance out of reach for many Americans when federal subsidies that help offset those costs are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats have been holding out for negotiations with Trump and the Republicans to keep those subsidies in place. Republicans say they can address the issue later, once the government reopens. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589172","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:04:00-04:00","title":"Scientists Thought This Fossil Was a Teen T. rex.

Turns out it's a new tyrannosaur \n         By Ari Daniel \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 1:04 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         It's known as the \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" fossil: A triceratops and a tyrannosaur, skeletons entangled, locked in apparent combat right up until the moment of their mutual demise. Even in the Hell Creek Formation in eastern Montana, a spot known for great finds, this specimen was, in a word, \"fantabulous,\" says  Clayton Phipps , a self-described rancher, cowboy and dinosaur hunter. That discovery in 2006 now appears to have overturned decades of dinosaur dogma about  Tyrannosaurus rex , the fearsome giant long thought to be the sole top predator stalking the late Cretaceous. In a paper in the journal  Nature , paleontologists  Lindsay Zanno  and  James Napoli  conclude that some of the bones from that specimen belong not to a teenage  T. rex , but to a fully grown individual of a different tyrannosaur species —  Nanotyrannus lancensis . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The majority of paleontologists, after some debate, had dismissed the idea that any other tyrannosaurs existed besides  T. rex . And yet, the sands of Montana seem to have disgorged a second one. In a broader analysis of other fossils, the two researchers also uncovered what they say is a third tyrannosaur species, formerly presumed to be a juvenile  T. rex . \"We knew the specimen was exceptional,\" says Zanno. \"We did not realize it would turn decades of research about  T. rex  on its head.\" \"Just insanely good\"   The Montana dig began on a breezy summer day when Phipps' friend, Mark Eatman, found an exposed pelvis and femur at the bottom of a canyon. Phipps thought maybe there was half a dinosaur hidden below. But after two weeks of digging, Phipps and his older cousin revealed that those bones belonged to a stunning triceratops. \"It was crazier than any site I've ever done before or since because every bone is in place,\" he says. \"The skeleton was just all together — just insanely good.\" Then, while excavating the light yellow sand from around the specimen, Phipps spotted something the color of chocolate. It was a claw. But triceratops didn't have claws. \"I'm like, 'What?' I start brushing and all of a sudden this arm starts to appear and part of the leg,\" he recalls. \"Oh man, my hat went in the air about 200 feet. I was like, 'No way — there's another dinosaur in here.'\" This was a bipedal,  carnivorous  dinosaur, entwined with the triceratops. \"Just laying like they died,\" says Phipps. The scientific consensus pegged this second dinosaur as a teenage  Tyrannosaurus rex  — a conclusion that would soon be overturned. Teenage angst A few years ago, the nonprofit  Friends of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences  acquired the fossils and rock they were encased in (some 30,000 pounds) from Phipps and donated them to the museum. \"They were a Christmas present waiting to be unwrapped,\" he says. Zanno, who is head of paleontology at the museum, was thrilled. \"It's one of the most incredible specimens from the late Cretaceous in North America I've ever seen,\" she says. She and the museum built  an entire wing around the dueling dinosaurs  to house a live-action research experience. \"It's the only place in the world where you get to enter the working paleo-lab without a barrier and talk to the scientific team that's working on the fossils,\" says Zanno. When that work began, Zanno also figured the carnivorous dinosaur was the world's most complete juvenile  T. rex  ever found. \"But as soon as we started actually studying this specimen, we realized there were a lot of red flags,\" she says. For context, paleontologists had previously debated whether small-bodied tyrannosaurs were teenage  T. rexes  or a different species altogether. The existence of a two-legged tyrannosaur species that lived alongside  T. rex  was proposed back in the 1940s, but had long since fallen out of favor. The consensus converged on juvenile  T. rex , \"meaning it would have been the only major predator in end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid impact,\" says Zanno. Most researchers believed that  T. rex  — which could be  12 feet high , 40 feet long and weigh around 15,000 pounds — had outcompeted all other meat-eating dinosaurs. The completeness of the new skeleton provided Zanno with the ideal specimen to test these long-standing conclusions. \"This is such a controversial topic,\" she says. \"And we don't want to write another paper that just stirs the pot. We want to write the paper that ends the debate.\" The dueling dinosaurs settle a duel One of the first of those red flags in the new specimen was the arm bones. They looked completely different than  T. rex 's puny appendages. \"We never had a complete arm of this animal,\" says Zanno. \"These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. They were using them for prey capture.\" Contrast that with  T. rex , \"an animal that's a mouth on legs.\" There were additional clues. The animal had fewer tail vertebrae and more teeth than  T. rex . Zanno and Napoli considered other lines of evidence. They created 3D models of numerous purported  T. rex es against which they compared their specimen. They looked at the growth stages of the cranial nerves and sinuses of close living relatives of dinosaurs, features that were visible in the fossilized skeleton. \"But maybe the most important and damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all,\" she says. This conclusion was based on slicing through the fossil's limb bones to examine the growth rings. That work demonstrated that this animal was mature and done growing when it died around the age of 20. \"That means it's half the size and a tenth of the mass of a full grown  Tyrannosaurus rex ,\" says Zanno. All of the results point to one conclusion, according to Zanno and Napoli. This was no teen  T. rex . This was a fully grown  Nanotyrannus lancensis  — the same species first identified in the 1940s and later largely dismissed by the paleontological community. It was \"a small, slender pursuit predator that could run under the legs of a  T. rex ,\" explains Zanno. In addition, while making models of all those other alleged  T. rex  skeletons, Zanno says they identified another new species of tyrannosaur, one they're calling  Nanotyrannus lethaeus . \"The name comes from Greco-Roman mythology for the [Lethe] River where souls used to drink and forget their prior lives and be reincarnated,\" she says. \"That's a reference to this animal having been under our nose and not recognized for what it was.\" For years, most researchers believed there was just one tyrannosaur —  rex . But now the king has been de-throned. There were at least two other tyrannosaurs holding court. \"It tells us that these end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid hit were flourishing,\" says Zanno. \"They had an abundance of different predators. And refutes this idea that dinosaurs were in decline before the asteroid struck.\" Loving being wrong Thomas Holtz , a paleontologist at the University of Maryland who wasn't involved in the research, welcomes the broader picture of tyrannosaur diversity proposed by the new study. \"I always said with sufficient evidence, I'd be happy to embrace it,\" he says. \"And now I can because there's sufficient evidence. I think they've made a very strong case.\" Though, he adds, \"We'll see if it lasts. As I like to point out, taxonomy is not permanent,\" referring to the study of how organisms are classified (and, sometimes, re-classified). Holtz argues that one consequence of the study is that paleontologists no longer know what a juvenile  T. rex  looked like — because previously assumed \"teenagers\" were likely  Nanotyrannus . That's an arena of future research and discovery, along with fleshing out the varied biologies and behaviors of this growing group of tyrannosaurs. Zanno agrees that there remains much to understand. She believes there's likely to be additional dinosaur species that have been hidden in plain sight in museums and collections across the world. \"This is why I love science,\" says Zanno. \"I have the only job in the world where my job is to second-guess myself every day and everything I think I know.\" \"When it comes to shedding doubt on research on Earth's most famous dinosaur,\" she says, referring to  T. rex , \"that's an intimidating endeavor. But this is how we grow as a profession and how we grow as scientists.\" Zanno believes this study will pave the way for paleontologists to look for more complex patterns in this and other prehistoric ecosystems. \"From here forward,\" Zanno adds, \"what I'm most thrilled about is how much we stand to learn by recognizing that we got it wrong the first time.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   Think of Tyrannosaurus rex, a fearsome dinosaur and the top predator stalking the late Cretaceous. Well, a new discovery suggests T. rex likely shared its dominion with another tyrannosaur species. The king had company. Here's science reporter Ari Daniel. ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: We start with Clayton Phipps... CLAYTON PHIPPS: I'm a rancher and a cowboy and a dinosaur hunter. DANIEL: ...Whose friend had found an exposed pelvis and femur at the bottom of a canyon in eastern Montana. The bones belong to a stunning triceratops. Then after excavating for about two weeks, there in the dug-up sand, Phipps spotted something the color of chocolate - a claw. But triceratops didn't have claws. PHIPPS: I'm like, what? I start brushing, and all of a sudden this arm starts to appear and part of the leg. Oh, man, my hat went in the air about 200 feet (laughter) 'cause I was like, no way. There's another dinosaur in here. DANIEL: This was a bipedal, carnivorous tyrannosaur entwined with the triceratops. PHIPPS: Just laying like they died. DANIEL: Phipps sold the fossils to the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, where Lindsay Zanno is head of paleontology. LINDSAY ZANNO: It's one of the most incredible specimens from the late Cretaceous in North America I've ever seen. DANIEL: Zanno and the museum built an entire wing around the dueling dinosaurs to house a live-action research experience. ZANNO: It's the only place in the world where you get to enter the working paleo lab and talk to the scientific team. DANIEL: Like many of her colleagues, Zanno started out thinking the carnivorous dinosaur was a juvenile T. rex, perhaps the most complete teenage tyrannosaur ever found. ZANNO: But as soon as we started actually studying this specimen, we realized there were a lot of red flags. DANIEL: One red flag was the arm bones, which were unlike T. rex's puny appendages. ZANNO: These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. DANIEL: The animal had fewer tail vertebrae than T. rex and more teeth. ZANNO: But maybe the most damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all. DANIEL: By slicing through the limb bones to examine the growth rings, Zanno and her colleagues found this animal was done growing when it died. It all pointed to one conclusion, she says. This was no teen T. rex. This was a different tyrannosaur species whose existence was long dismissed by most paleontologists. This was a fully grown Nanotyrannus lancensis. ZANNO: A small, slender pursuit predator that could run under the legs of a T. rex. This is an animal that's using its arms to hunt prey. Tyrannosaurus rex is an animal that's a mouth on legs. DANIEL: For years, most researchers believe there was just one tyrannosaur, rex. This work dethrones the king. There were other tyrannosaurs holding court. ZANNO: It tells us that these end Cretaceous ecosystems were flourishing before the asteroid struck. DANIEL: The findings appear in the journal Nature. Thomas Holtz is a paleontologist at the University of Maryland who wasn't involved in the study. He welcomes the broader picture of tyrannosaur diversity. THOMAS HOLTZ: I always said, with sufficient evidence, I'd be happy to embrace it. And now I can. But we'll see if it lasts. As I like to point out, taxonomy is not permanent. DANIEL: The study opens up numerous research avenues about the varied biologies (ph) and behaviors of what appears to be a growing group of tyrannosaurs. Lindsay Zanno again. ZANNO: This is why I love science. What I'm most thrilled about is how much we stand to learn by recognizing that we got it wrong the first time. DANIEL: For NPR News, I'm Ari Daniel.

Here's what to know \n         By Michelle Andrews \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This year's Obamacare open enrollment period, which starts Saturday in most states, is full of uncertainty and confusion for the more than  24 million people  who buy health insurance through the federal and state Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The fate of the enhanced premium tax credits that make coverage more affordable for  92% of enrollees  remains up in the air, with the prospect of significantly  higher premiums looming . But there are steps marketplace shoppers can take to ensure they make the right choices for the upcoming plan year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. Understand how we got here In 2021, as part of a COVID-era relief package, the ACA premium tax credits were enhanced to lower costs for previously eligible people and expand eligibility to people with incomes over 400% of the federal poverty level (which amounts to  about $63,000  for one person in 2025). But those enhancements, which were extended in 2022,  will expire  at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts. The debate over whether to extend them again has been at the center of a political battle of wills between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, a fight at the heart of the now month-old  government shutdown. The financial implications for many marketplace enrollees are huge. Average out-of-pocket premium payments for subsidized enrollees are projected to more than double if the enhanced tax credits expire, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. \"The longer this goes on, the more damage is done,\" said  Cynthia Cox , a vice president and the director of the Program on the ACA at KFF. \"If someone logs on Nov. 1 and sees their premium doubling, they might just walk away.\" That would be a mistake, marketplace experts agree. What is clear, though, is that buyers need to beware and be informed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Follow the news It can be frustrating to track day-to-day Capitol Hill machinations. But that may be your best source for up-to-date information. Congress could make a deal to extend the enhanced subsidies anytime during the next few days, weeks or months -- or not. Either way, it could affect your enrollment decision. So, pay attention. Don't count on the marketplace or your insurer to notify you about what you should expect to pay. \"Many state marketplaces have hit delay\" on sending consumers notices of net premiums, which take premium tax credits into account, said  Sabrina Corlette , a co-director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. The federal government doesn't send enrollees notices about plan premiums for the coming year for the  28 federally facilitated  marketplaces. For 2026, it has said that health plans can also  opt not  to. 3. Update your account information and don't auto-enroll Log in to your marketplace account and update your income, household size, and any other details that have changed. This year, it's particularly important to provide an accurate estimate of your anticipated income for 2026. A provision in HR 1, sometimes called the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act ,  eliminated the caps  on what many people were required to repay if they underestimated their projected income and received more premium assistance than they should have. Next year, people will have to repay the entire excess amount. In the past few years, it's been possible to put your ACA insurance on auto-pilot with  automatic reenrollment  in your current or a similar plan. Given the uncertainty around premiums, this is not a good year to do that, enrollment specialists say. This is especially true for people who, without a deal in Congress, will no longer qualify for subsidies next year, specifically those whose incomes are over 400% of the federal poverty level. 4. Shop based on sticker prices When people see their projected premiums, assuming Congress hasn't reached a deal to extend the enhanced credits, many will be shocked. Health insurance premiums on the marketplaces are expected to increase, on average, 26% next year,  according to KFF . That's the largest rate increase since 2018. Until now, people have largely been shielded from those increases by the enhanced premium tax subsidies that nearly all enrollees receive. Here's how it works: Most people with ACA marketplace plans are responsible for paying a portion of their premium based on a sliding income scale, and the government pays the rest. According to an analysis by KFF, if the enhanced credits are not renewed, a family of four with $75,000 in income, for example,  will be responsible  for paying $5,865 in annual premiums for a benchmark silver plan in 2026 — more than double the $2,498 it'll pay if they are renewed. When evaluating a plan, focus on the listed price. If it's not affordable without the enhanced tax credits, it's not a good buy. \"People need to make a decision based on what is in front of them,\" Cox said. If you can't afford the sticker price without the enhanced credits, consider enrolling in a less generous plan with a lower premium but a higher deductible, Cox said. Bronze plans must provide comprehensive coverage, including covering preventive care at no cost, and may cover some doctor visits before the deductible. \"In most cases, it makes more sense to have a bronze plan than to be uninsured,\" she said. The Trump administration has been promoting  catastrophic plans  as a more affordable option for people who face financial hardship, including those who don't qualify for subsidies because their incomes are either less than 100% or more than 400% of the federal poverty level. Similar to bronze plans, catastrophic plans cover a set of essential health benefits, provide free preventive care, and must cover at least three doctor visits before people reach their deductible. But catastrophic plan deductibles are the highest of any type of marketplace plan: $10,600 for individuals and $21,200 for families in 2026. \"They are expensive relative to what they cover,\" said  Jennifer Sullivan , director of health coverage access at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noting premiums can cost several hundred dollars. 5. Come back, check, and recheck If you're dismayed at premium prices on your first pass, \"don't slam the computer shut and decide that there are no options for you,\" Sullivan said. \"Congress might still act and things might change radically.\" Lawmakers could restore the enhanced premium tax credits right up to the end of the year, or later. In a majority of states, including the 28 that use the federal government's centralized marketplace, open enrollment lasts until Jan. 15. There are also other key dates to remember. In most states, people  must enroll  by Dec. 15 for coverage starting Jan. 1, and by Jan. 15 for coverage starting Feb. 1, though some states have later deadlines. 6. Wait to pay your premium Premium payments are generally due before the plan takes effect, although marketplaces and insurers have flexibility to extend deadlines, Corlette said. They might allow people extra time to make a first payment, for example. \"We've seen that in the past. State officials and insurance companies have gotten creative to try and keep people in coverage,\" she said. But if there is a last-minute deal and someone has already paid their premium for January coverage and received a lower tax credit than the deal provides, they should still be able to receive the higher credit. \"There are ways to make people whole,\" Corlette said, although how that might happen this enrollment period is unclear.

Hundreds killed in Darfur hospital massacre, 'hero' doctors abducted \n         By Kate Bartlett \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 12:26 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — For months doctors at the last functioning hospital in the wartorn Sudanese city of el-Fasher performed operations by torchlight, desperately trying to save lives in the most impossible conditions. The Saudi Maternity Hospital was a last refuge for the sick and injured in the besieged city, as fighting raged around them. Despite no electricity, shortages of supplies, and frequently coming under heavy shelling, medical staff kept going. \"They are heroes, honestly,\" said Dr Mohamed Faisal Elsheikh, a Sudanese medical doctor based in Manchester and a spokesperson for the Sudan Doctors Network. \"They really work in a very difficult environment, they had no medical instruments, there's no any medicines over there, there's no electricity…and yet with all dedication and commitment…they saved as much as they could of people's lives.\" No longer. Since the city fell to the Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on Sunday, the doctors have been kidnapped and reports have emerged of a massacre at the hospital. \"On 28 October, six health workers, four doctors, a nurse and a pharmacist, were abducted,\" from the hospital, the World Health Organization said in a statement Wednesday. \"On the same day, more than 460 patients and their companions were reportedly shot and killed in the hospital.\" WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was \"deeply shocked\" and \"appalled\" by the massacre and called for health facilities, health workers and patients to be protected under international law. \"Prior to this latest attack, WHO has verified 185 attacks on health care in Sudan with 1204 deaths and 416 injuries of health workers and patients since the start of the conflict in April 2023,\" he said. Videos of the attack believed to have been filmed by RSF fighters themselves are circulating online. While they cannot be independently verified by NPR, they show militia men walking through the ransacked wards, stepping over piles of dead bodies and shooting anyone left alive at point blank range. RSF leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo has pledged to investigate the allegations of war crimes by his soldiers in el-Fasher - but many doubt his sincerity, as he has failed to investigate previous atrocities. Since overtaking el-Fasher– which they had besieged for over 500 days – and chasing out the Sudanese army, videos,  satellite imagery , and testimony from those who've managed to flee indicate the RSF has been pursuing a scorched earth policy in the Darfuri city. The RSF has been fighting the national army for control of the resource-rich nation that sits at the vital crossroads between North Africa, the Sahel, and the Red Sea in a bloody civil war since 2023. 'Crisis of apathy' The group emerged from the janjaweed militia that terrorized Darfur in the early 2000s and was accused of genocide. The US has already accused the RSF and allied Arab militias of committing genocide against African ethnic groups in the current conflict. The situation in el-Fasher was dire even before the RSF overran it this week. The year and a half long blockade of some 250,000 civilians has led to starvation and famine. The UN's migration organization says 26,000 people have managed to flee since the takeover. Many of those are arriving seeking help in the town of Tawila, in north Darfur, where medical charity Doctors Without Borders is running the closest health point. Doctors Without Borders used to provide support to the Saudi hospital but stopped operating in el-Fasher in August 2024 saying it had become too dangerous. On Wednesday the NGO said people arriving at Tawila were showing \"extremely alarming levels of malnutrition among women and children, which is indicative of a famine-like situation.\" The organization's International president Dr Mohamed Javid Abdelmoneim noted however, that very few adult men were arriving, and said this raised concerns about ethnically targeted violence. \"This is testament to the horror unfolding in and around the city,\" he said. One mother of six, who had fled el-Fasher but didn't wish to be named to protect her identity, told aid workers from international NGO Save the Children what they had endured. \"We hid the children in trenches, and we ran into abandoned buildings during the attacks. After that, we just ate umbaz (animal feed),\" she said. Another woman described the long trek to safety, during which she was beaten and robbed by a gang. \"We lost family members, we lost neighbors, we lost everyone,\" she recounted. \"We've been walking for the past four days from el-Fasher. A group of motorbike riders met us on the way…They killed people and insulted us a lot.\" The UN Security Council held a meeting on the crisis Thursday. The UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said the violence recalls the horrors of the genocide in Darfur two decades ago. \"But what is different today, we are seeing a different global reaction. One of resignation,\" he said. \"So this is also a crisis of apathy.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   A paramilitary group fighting a civil war in Sudan has killed more than 460 patients and their companions at the last functioning hospital in the city of el-Fasher. That's according to the World Health Organization. Kate Bartlett reports that it is one of the worst atrocities of Sudan's 2 1/2-year war, according to human rights groups. And a warning - listeners will hear gunshots in this piece. KATE BARTLETT: Dr. Mohamed Faisal Elsheikh, a spokesperson for the Sudan Doctors Network, says there's only one word to describe the doctors who worked in el-Fasher. MOHAMED FAISAL ELSHEIKH: They are heroes, honestly. They really worked in a very difficult environment. BARTLETT: But that didn't stop them. ELSHEIKH: They had no - any medical instruments. There's no any medicines. There's no electricity. And yet, with all dedication and commitment, they saved as much as they could of people life. BARTLETT: But now, the Saudi Maternity Hospital is in ruins, filled with the bodies of patients executed by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, and the doctors have been taken captive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEPHANE DUJARRIC: We were horrified by reports of the tragic killings of more than 460 people, both patients and their companions, at the Saudi Maternity Hospital in el-Fasher. BARTLETT: That's the U.N. secretary general's spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, speaking on Wednesday about the massacre. The U.N. says health facilities, doctors and patients must be protected under international law. RSF leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, has pledged to investigate the allegations, but many doubt his sincerity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED RSF MEMBER: (Non-English language spoken). BARTLETT: Aid organizations circulated a video that appears to have been filmed by the RSF themselves that shows their fighters walking through the hospital's wards, shooting anyone left alive. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT) BARTLETT: For over two years now, the RSF, made up of former janjaweed fighters, has been fighting Sudan's army. Two decades ago, the janjaweed were accused of genocide in Darfur. Now their successors are fighting for control of Sudan's rich resources. It's not the first time the RSF has targeted health care facilities. Most of Sudan's hospitals are either closed or in desperate condition. (CROSSTALK) BARTLETT: Now those who've managed to flee el-Fasher are desperately seeking help. MOHAMED JAVID ABDELMONEIM: Our teams are working 60 kilometers away in Tawila, where they're seeing people starting to arrive from el-Fasher. BARTLETT: That's Doctors Without Borders international president, Mohamed Javid Abdelmoneim. ABDELMONEIM: Among all the people arriving in Tawila, we're seeing very few adult men. Given the history of ethnically targeted violence in el-Fasher, we are deeply concerned about the risk of a potential bloodbath. BARTLETT: For Dr. Elsheikh, his thoughts are with the abducted staff.

He attended the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, addressed U.S. troops in Japan and met with China's President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Here are five takeaways from the president's first visit to the region in his second term. 1) U.S.-China trade relations have mostly stabilized… On the flight back to Washington after his meeting with Xi on Thursday, Trump said the tariff rate on Chinese exports would be lowered from 57% to 47%. The 10-point drop comes because Xi committed to trying to decrease the amount of fentanyl coming into the U.S. That issue has been a priority for Trump, who months ago put an extra 20% tariff on China because of fentanyl. Trump also said that China would resume buying soybeans from the U.S., which has been a major issue for American farmers since China had halted those purchases. China also agreed to back off the extra limits it had put on rare earths exports, in exchange for the U.S. scaling back some of its own export restrictions. That agreement will hold for a year. Those minerals are critical for the U.S. and other countries because they are used in military equipment and other technology. 2) But a finalized deal isn't done. \"It was an outstanding group of decisions I think that was made,\" Trump told reporters after his meeting with Xi, \"There wasn't too much left out there.\" But he wasn't specific about what exactly is left for China and the U.S. to discuss. Trump said he is scheduled to visit China next April, which will be followed by another meeting with Xi in either Washington or in Florida. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dennis Wilder, a former national security official and a professor at Georgetown University, said the meeting between Trump and Xi gave \"momentum\" for trade talks between the two countries to continue. \"Both sides have not given up their trade weapons but merely have agreed to stop firing as long as both sides hold to the agreements,\" Wilder said. 3) Diplomacy = flattery A charm offensive was on full display in Malaysia, Japan and Korea as leaders tried to appease Trump ahead of trade talks and other negotiations. Trump's style of foreign relations is often rooted in personal relationships; heads of state, when visiting Washington, have tried to appease Trump to have a smoother relationship with the president. That strategy came forward in Asia, too. Nearly 100 dancers in Malaysia greeted Trump on the red carpet at his first stop. In Japan, Trump was gifted late Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's golf clubs and the newly elected prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, announced that she was going to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump's arrival in South Korea was also full of fanfare – YMCA, a song that's played at Trump's rallies for nearly a decade, was performed on the tarmac in Busan when Air Force One landed. President Lee Jae Myung gave Trump a replica of a golden crown significant to Korea's history. Trump also got a gold medal and was awarded Korea's highest civilian honor. 4) Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker Trump has renamed the Department of Defense as the Department of War, he's deployed National Guard troops around different U.S. cities and in recent weeks, he has ordered strikes on a number of boats in the eastern Pacific allegedly carrying drugs. But on this trip in Asia, Trump wanted to emphasize his role as a peacemaker. His first stop in Malaysia at the ASEAN summit included presiding over the signing of a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand. A border dispute reignited between the two countries earlier this year, and Trump helped broker a ceasefire by threatening to increase tariffs. In his remarks in Kuala Lumpur, Trump said he was in Scotland playing golf when he got on the phone with the leaders from Cambodia and Thailand, and Malaysia, who also helped broker peace. \"You caused me very good entertainment. I could've had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun for me than anything,\" Trump said. Even before the trip, Trump had been claiming his administration has ended eight global conflicts. Russia's war in Ukraine hasn't been one of them, which has frustrated Trump. But it's possible he adds another conflict to solve to his peacemaking list. Though he didn't meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while in Asia, Trump left the door open for a future meeting and said his administration would work on tensions between North and South Korea, who never formally ended their war. 5) Trump's making deals abroad, but Congress is still at a standstill Despite the deal-making and peace-making on the world's stage, Trump came home to a federal government that's still shut down, federal workers who aren't getting paid and critical programs like SNAP running out of funding. The president hasn't shown the same interest in making deals across the aisle with Democrats to reopen the government. Instead, he returned to Washington Thursday night and mused on Truth Social about using the \"nuclear option,\" which he said would be to get rid of the filibuster. That would allow Senate Republicans to pass a funding agreement with a simple majority, not a 60-vote majority that would require support from Democrats. \"We are in power and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying 'SHUT DOWN',\" Trump said, adding that it would \"take advantage\" of Democrats. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591378","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:40:00-04:00","title":"Why an interstellar comet has scientists excited","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known object from outside our solar system to enter it, has captured scientists' attention due to the detection of nickel vapor in its surrounding gas at a distance of nearly four times Earth's distance from the sun — a condition where metals normally do not vaporize.

The comet is special both because it is interstellar — meaning it came from outside our solar system — and also because nickel vapor was detected in the gas surrounding the comet. This comet,  called 3I/ATLAS , is only the third such interstellar object to enter our solar system in recorded history. Observing such a rare occurrence is \"extremely valuable for us,\" because it's the only opportunity to look at this object before it moves out of our solar system, said Darryl Z. Seligman, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University, who is coordinating international teams of scientists that are observing 3I/ATLAS. Rohan Rahatgaonkar, a Ph.D. student at the Instituto de Astrofísica-Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, and Thomas Puzia, who led the team there that made the discovery, were among the authors of a new  research paper  describing the nickel vapor detection. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The findings are notable because the nickel   gas surrounding 3I/ATLAS was detected at a huge distance from the sun (nearly four times Earth's distance from the sun) where temperatures are too cold for metals to normally vaporize, Rahatgaonkar told NPR in an interview. \"It was pretty clear that it was nickel,\" Puzia said of the data. \"So it was super, super exciting.\" Puzia cautions that there's still a lot of evidence collection and research to be done into what these findings could mean. But this study into  3I/ATLAS  opens the door for new insights into the chemistry of objects and materials that originate far outside of our solar system and are likely billions of years old, he said. The comet could be older than our solar system 3I/ATLAS was first confirmed on July 1 to be the third interstellar object known to have come into our solar system, in a sky survey by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). When Rahatgaonkar and another student, Baltasar Luco, were set to observe the comet through the Southern Astrophysical Research (or SOAR) Telescope in Chile, they were not looking for nickel vapors. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But over multiple days of observations with the Very Large Telescope in Chile and as 3I/ATLAS continued its journey closer to the sun, Rahatgaonkar and other researchers found that levels of nickel vapor continued to increase. They measured the nickel using a host of instruments including a spectrograph and by looking at characteristics of the light coming off the comet. Rahatgaonkar and Puzia also credit a team of researchers around the world, using telescopes and other instruments, for helping to observe and analyze data on the comet. The analysis of this object is far from over. As it continues its journey close to the sun, it will undergo thermodynamic changes which will cause reactions that could, hopefully, give scientists more clues about where 3I/ATLAS was formed, how it evolved, what it carries and many more potential answers, Puzia said. This particular interstellar comet \"could be maybe older than our solar system,\" Rahatgaonkar said. The chemical signatures being emitted from 3I/ATLAS \"reflect the ancient origin and its long journey through interstellar space.\" Rahatgaonkar, Puzia and Seligman emphasized how valuable interstellar objects are to understanding star systems outside of our own solar system. They offer chemical and physical details from those systems and where they formed, potentially billions of years ago. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581424","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Automakers take a hit from tariffs, but some still see strong earnings","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite facing high tariffs, semiconductor shortages, and a fire at an aluminum plant, U.S. automakers are reporting resilient earnings in 2025.

a hit from tariffs, but some still see strong earnings \n         By Camila Domonoske \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Automakers have been footing a hefty tariff bill — to the tune of $30 billion across the industry this year, according to a recent analysis from Moody's. The industry is also grappling with a shortage of semiconductors, leaving them without the chips they need to build some vehicles, as well as a  fire at an aluminum plant  that's hurting the supply chain for Ford and Stellantis. Despite those headwinds, quarterly earnings reports from automakers are so far showing resilience. General Motors reported $3.4 billion in profits last quarter and Ford brought in $2.6 billion, both beating expectations. Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, increased its revenues by 13% year over year. Hyundai, despite seeing a 29% decline in profits compared to the same quarter last year, still plans to meet its targets for the year. Volkswagen Group, on the other hand, reported a more than billion-dollar loss, as it faced the combined costs of tariffs and Porsche's pivot from electric vehicles back to gasoline. Part of the reason for automakers' positive reports is that Trump lowered tariffs on goods from  Japan  and  Europe  from 25% to 15%, and just recently announced a similar deal with  Korea . While a 15% tariff is still substantial, the changes were welcomed by automakers. Meanwhile, a  recent policy change  eased the burden of tariffs on imported parts that go into U.S.-built cars. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Automakers' bottom lines are also getting a boost from  rising car prices . Companies have been cautious about  passing tariff costs along  to consumers, in part because cars are already so expensive — over $50,000 on average, according to Kelley Blue Book. There are real questions about how much more consumers are willing or able to pay. But gradual increases are now visible. Across the industry, prices are up about .5% this year, Ford says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Meanwhile, the Trump administration's  rollback of environmental rules  is benefitting some automakers substantially — in particular, changes to  emissions requirements  that used to penalize automakers if they made too many high-polluting vehicles. Suddenly, automakers do not have to manufacture electric vehicles, which they have struggled to make profitably. And they can build as many large pickup trucks as they can sell — which are both more polluting and more profitable. That's been a boost to companies like GM, Stellantis and Ford, offsetting the costs of tariffs. Of course, that same policy change is a setback for all-electric automakers like Tesla and Rivian. Under the previous rules, automakers that wanted to make gas guzzlers could pay EV manufacturers for \"regulatory credits,\" allowing them to borrow their rivals' green halos — and comply with federal rules. Now, that revenue stream for EV makers is being eliminated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Tesla had strong sales last quarter, helped by  the rush to buy EVs  as consumers tried to take advantage of the now-eliminated consumer EV tax credit. But profits fell. (On Tesla's quarterly call with investors, Musk,  as   usual , was less interested in talking about those EV sales and much more interested in talking about the humanoid robots that he plans to sell.) Rivian is expected to report earnings next week. Those policy changes are slowing the transition to electric vehicles. GM is ending production of its electric commercial van, and Stellantis is  leaning heavily  into inefficient Hemi engines, as a new CEO pivots away from a  previous focus on electrification . But executives are also consistently saying they still plan to invest in electric vehicles. \"EVs remain our North Star,\" said Mary Barra, explaining that GM will continue to work on  improved EV batteries . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Partly, that's because of competitive pressure, as Chinese automakers make increasingly  attractive and affordable electric vehicles . But automakers also know that just as the Trump administration did a U-turn on EVs, a future administration might once again make climate change and air pollution major priorities. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We expect adoption will increase over time and the market [will] continue to evolve — and maybe even regulations evolve,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley told investors. So Ford still plans to move forward with  a $30,000 electric pickup , despite the lack of federal tax credits or regulations that would encourage it. \"We think this product is literally at the center of the future of the EV market in the U.S.,\" Farley said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590818","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:06:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he wants to resume nuclear testing.

Here's what that would mean \n         By Geoff Brumfiel \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 1:06 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump said on Thursday that  the U.S. would begin testing nuclear weapons again  for the first time in decades. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We've halted many years ago, but with others doing testing I think it's appropriate to do so,\" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. Experts say that the resumption of testing would be a major escalation and could upend the nuclear balance of power. \"I think a decision to resume nuclear testing would be extremely dangerous and would do more to benefit our adversaries than the United States,\" said Corey Hinderstein, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for Nuclear Peace. Here's what a test would involve, and why the president might be calling for one now. There's currently only one place America could test a nuke — near Las Vegas, Nevada The Nevada National Security Site , approximately 60 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is currently the only place where America could test a nuclear weapon, said Robert Peters, a senior research fellow for strategic deterrence at the Heritage Foundation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Nevada site is around 1,300 square miles in size, larger than the state of Rhode Island. Starting in the 1950s, scientists conducted atmospheric nuclear tests at the site, but from 1962 to 1992, testing was done underground. Today, testing would likely be done in \"a complex of deep underground mineshafts,\" Peters said. Scientists dig a deep shaft either directly below ground or into the side of a mountain. They then put a nuclear device in a chamber at the end of the shaft and seal it up. The detonation is contained by the rock, reducing the risk of atmospheric fallout. Although underground testing is far safer than atmospheric testing, it still carries risks, said Hinderstein. In the past, some radioactive fallout has leaked from test shafts. Additionally, the test could shake buildings as far away as Las Vegas, and Hinderstein said some of the newer buildings in Vegas could even be at risk of damage. \"All of these big high-rises — including Stratosphere, including the Trump Hotel,\" she said. \"They're not designed for massive, significant seismic activity.\" America's last test in Nevada was over 30 years ago At the end of the Cold War, the world's major nuclear powers declared a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing. Russia, then the Soviet Union, tested its last nuclear weapon in 1990, the U.S. conducted its final test in 1992, and China conducted its last test in 1996. The voluntary test moratorium has been in place as part of an effort to maintain nuclear stability. The U.S currently uses scientific experiments and supercomputer simulations to make sure its bombs still work. Last year, NPR was one of a handful of organizations granted  rare access  to the top-secret underground tunnels where the tests take place. Scientists working in the tunnels said they were confident they could continue to ensure the safety of America's nuclear weapons without testing. Although a full-scale nuclear detonation would be \"complementary\" to current experiments, \"our assessment is that there are no system questions that would be answered by a test, that would be worth the expense and the effort and the time,\" Don Haynes, a nuclear weapons scientist from Los Alamos National Laboratory told NPR as they walked through the tunnels. Indeed Hinderstein says, preparing for a nuclear test is no small matter. While a basic demonstration test could be done in approximately 18 months. Conducting a test that would produce scientifically useful data would likely take years. Trump's announcement is likely reacting to some recent tests by Russia On Sunday,  Russia announced  it had conducted a successful test of a new nuclear-powered cruise missile. Then on Wednesday President Vladimir Putin announced the successful test of another doomsday weapon —  a nuclear-powered underwater drone , which Russia says can be used to attack coastal cities. Trump never called out Russia by name, but he did suggest recent testing was behind the announcement. \"I see them testing,\" he said aboard Air Force One, \"and I say, 'Well if they're going to test I guess we have to test.'\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While testing nuclear-powered weapons is not the same as testing nuclear weapons themselves, Russia's tests are highly provocative. They come just months before the expiration of the last nuclear treaty between the U.S. and Russia, designed to put limits on their arsenals. The back-and-forth has all the hallmarks of the start of an arms race, noted Jon Wolfsthal, the director of global risk at the Federation for American Scientists. \"We saw this play out throughout the Cold War through nuclear testing, nuclear deployments, nuclear investments,\" he said. Many experts warn that now is not the time to resume nuclear testing Hinderstein, who served as a deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the agency responsible for America's nuclear weapons, from 2021 to 2024, said that a decision to resume testing would not be in America's interests. By the end of the Cold War, the U.S. had conducted more than a thousand nuclear tests — far more than any other nation (China, by comparison, had conducted just 45). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Other nations \"have more to gain by resuming nuclear testing than the United States does,\" she said. Testing would likely be expensive, adds Paul Dean, vice president for global nuclear policy at the Nuclear Threat Initiative. \"The cost estimates I've seen have been at around, ballpark, $140 million per test,\" he said. \"It's not necessary to conduct a nuclear explosive test right now,\" agreed Robert Peters of the Heritage Foundation. But he added, \"But there could very well be compelling reasons to test in the coming months and years. That's how bad things are getting.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   It has been 33 years since the United States last tested a nuclear weapon. Now President Trump says he wants to do it again. Here he is on Air Force One earlier today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, we have more than anybody. But I see them testing. I say, well, if they're go to test, I guess we have to test. SUMMERS: What might the president mean by that? Let's bring in NPR science and security correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Hi. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi there. SUMMERS: So Geoff, the president said, if they're going to test, I guess we have to test. So I guess my question is, who's they? BRUMFIEL: Yeah. It wasn't entirely clear from what he said, but experts I spoke to today agree it's almost certainly Russia. On Sunday, Russia announced it had successfully tested a nuclear-powered cruise missile. Then yesterday, it said it had tested a nuclear-powered torpedo. Now, nuclear-powered things obviously aren't the same as nuclear bombs, but both the missile and torpedo are designed to carry nuclear warheads. And these tests are very provocative because these devices could get around Trump's proposed Golden Dome missile defense system. SUMMERS: OK. So if the U.S. were to test a nuclear weapon, let's say, what would be involved? BRUMFIEL: Well, first of all, there's only one place they can do it, and that's in the desert outside of Las Vegas, Nevada. It's a place called the Nevada National Security Site. It's absolutely massive. I was out there last year. It's bigger than the state of Rhode Island. SUMMERS: Huh. BRUMFIEL: Basically, they dig a hole, bury the weapon thousands of feet underground, and then they detonate it. Corey Hinderstein is at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and until last year, she was high up in the agency that manages America's nuclear weapons. She told me this. COREY HINDERSTEIN: The president is talking about sending a signal. And if the goal is to shake the ground, then we could do it on the timeline that he's required. BRUMFIEL: But the test site is not ready to do a really scientific test. They don't have the experiment design. They don't have the instrumentation. That kind of test would take years to develop because the U.S. hasn't tested since 1992. SUMMERS: Well, why has it been so long since the U.S. tested a nuclear weapon? BRUMFIEL: At the end of the Cold War, the world's great nuclear powers voluntarily stopped testing kind of as a gesture of goodwill. That voluntary moratorium has held in part because the U.S. has spent billions of dollars on supercomputers to simulate nuclear weapons. They like to call it a bang in a box. And actually, many experts told me the moratorium works to the U.S.' advantage. They have data from over a thousand nuclear tests already on the books. China, by contrast, for example, has just 45. Hinderstein says America's adversaries would gain a lot more from additional testing than the U.S. would. HINDERSTEIN: While we could potentially gain incrementally - but even that is questionable - they could stand to gain a lot and not suffer the political hit by being the first to resume testing. BRUMFIEL: I should add, there are possible environmental consequences too. Radioactive material can leak from underground sometimes. And there's some concern that shaking from the test could actually damage buildings all the way in Vegas. SUMMERS: So Geoff, the Russians have tested these new weapons, and America may test a nuclear bomb for the first time in decades. So I do have to ask, is this a new arms race? BRUMFIEL: You know, the experts I spoke to were divided on that. During the Cold War, we had so many nukes, and so did the Russia. It was sort of insane. Now, things aren't as bad as they used to be, but everyone agrees these are the dynamics that drive an arms race. You know, one side does one thing, and then the other side says, I've got to look strong, so I'm going to respond with something else. So there's a lot of concern over what's happening. SUMMERS: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel, thank you. BRUMFIEL: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95855","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:12:00-04:00","title":"Judge Sentences Jan. 6 Defendant for Hoax Threat Near Obama's Home","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge has sentenced Taylor Taranto, a Navy veteran from Pasco, Washington, to time served for making a hoax threat near former President Barack Obama’s home in 2023, which triggered a massive law enforcement response involving bomb squads and sniffer dogs.

\n        \n        \n      \n\n         A federal judge has sentenced a man to time served for making a  hoax threat  near the D.C. residence of former President Barack Obama two years ago, prompting a massive law enforcement response that included a bomb squad and sniffer dogs. Taylor Taranto, of Pasco, Wash., spent 22 months in the troubled D.C. jail facility while he waited for trial on allegations that he suggested his van was rigged with explosives.  Authorities never found any such devices, though they did recover firearms and a machete. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols noted that Taranto had no criminal history — partly because the Justice Department had previously moved to dismiss several charges related to Taranto's participation in the siege on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. President Trump  granted clemency  to Taranto and virtually every Jan. 6 defendant on the first day he returned to the White House this year. But the storming of the Capitol and the Justice Department response to it continue to reverberate, especially within the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington. Trump and his cabinet officials are trying to rewrite the history of that day, in part by firing or forcing out law enforcement officials who investigated cases related to the riot.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This week the Justice Department sidelined two veteran prosecutors who had worked on the Taranto case and took the rare step of withdrawing a sentencing memo they had filed. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro declined to comment on any personnel decisions but in a statement said \"we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously.\" \"We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target,\" Pirro said in the statement. Original sentencing memo sealed, replaced The original sentencing memo in Taranto's case detailed how a \"mob of rioters\" attacked the seat of government as Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 election. It also mentioned that Taranto headed in the direction of Obama's home after Trump reposted an address of a location on social media. A replacement sentencing memo, filed by a new pair of DOJ lawyers, scrubbed both of those references. The electronic court docket last night listed the original memo as sealed. Judge Nichols said it was \"not entirely clear\" how that memo had come to be sealed and that he intended to release it unless the DOJ could justify keeping it hidden. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The judge did not press the new attorneys for details about the rare, last-minute personnel switch. But he went out of his way to praise the sidelined prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White. \"I just want to express my view that they did a commendable and excellent job in this case,\" Judge Nichols said. \"They also held the highest standards of professionalism.\" At a press conference on a D.C. crime issue, Pirro declined to answer whether she ordered the original sentencing memo in the Taranto case to be revoked. \"I think the papers speak for themselves and what goes on in this office is not something I'm going to comment on to the press,\" Pirro said.

Here's what that means across the country \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:22 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The federal government shutdown has dragged into another week, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to ending it. Many  federal workers have missed paychecks , including  air traffic controllers , who are working unpaid.  The impacts of the shutdown could soon get worse. That's because a number of federal programs are set to run out of money on Nov. 1. If that happens,  tens of millions of people  would lose  federal food and nutrition benefits  like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. Also set to  run out of funding  are some Head Start programs, early-learning centers for low-income families, that serve more than 65,000 children nationwide.  Read more about how food banks are bracing for SNAP funding to lapse The  Agriculture Department says  it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to  help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid . At the same time  many American farmers  say the Trump administration's trade policies have them on the brink. As the shutdown continues, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down? A  partisan argument  over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some  24 million people  — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.  Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is  not true . Democrats in the Senate  refused to vote  for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP  spending and tax bill  that passed over the summer. NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a  key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock . That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when subscribers could  see big premium increases  unless the subsidies that have been helping people pay for coverage since 2021 are extended. Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here. Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as  a health care showdown . —  Selena Simmons-Duffin , NPR What about WIC and SNAP benefits ? Of those at risk of  losing food and nutrition aid  if the shutdown continues into November, 7 million receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC.) Nearly 42 million who rely on SNAP are also expected to lose their benefits. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the  program will run out of money Nov. 1 .  In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits \"until further notice\" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift  money from its contingency fund and other places  to keep SNAP at least partially funded. As NPR's Stephen Fowler reports, a coalition of more than two dozen Democratic state leaders  are suing the Trump administration over its decision  to suspend federal food benefits during the government shutdown. A federal court decision in that case  may come as soon as Thursday . WIC was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration  shifted $300 million in tariff revenue  to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's  calling for an additional $300 million  to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some  states  could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources. —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR Read more on the impact of this potential lapse across the country, here.  — and you can  read more here about how food banks are bracing for it   What about Head Start? Beginning Nov. 1,  more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start , the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down. Among the states  hit hardest  by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio. Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support. Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out. Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences. —  Cory Turner  and  Kadin Mills , NPR What the shutdown means for federal workers Altogether,  about 1.4 million civilian federal employees  across the country are going without pay,  according to the Bipartisan Policy Center , a think tank in Washington, D.C. Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over. The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but   the White House has tried to cast doubt on that. The Senate has  failed to advance a pair of competing measures  to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.  The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security. Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to   further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court ;  the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday  indefinitely halted  the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units. How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?  The Trump administration  earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members , according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, but it only covered one pay cycle. Many are expecting their next paycheck at the end of this month. Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,\" according to a  statement by USPS . The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A  contingency plan  from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees  were issued  reduction in force, or RIF, notices  on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data. —  Scott Horsley ,  Andrea Hsu  and  Stephen Fowler , NPR National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines. According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\" Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week. —  Geoff Brumfiel , NPR In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting  more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada  could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open. Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees  have been temporary furloughed , as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans. At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly  $15 billion  in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. The courts  have halted  those layoffs. If they're ultimately allowed to go through, multiple sources told NPR the special education office would be left with just a handful of top executives and support staff. In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed  were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is  suing the Trump administration  for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. —  Shannon Bond  and  Cory Turner , NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's  Corrinne Hess  reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that  student financial aid programs will continue , despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have  brought their operations to a halt . That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise  reports that the Smithsonian assured the public  that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure.  Animal cams  are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As  KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported , a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support WBUR's Andrea Shea reports  that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open. Shea reports that  NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs  through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security,   VA  and other benefits will continue. But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the  government shutdown  has left them  unable to carry out an important service for some recipients . As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These  official letters  act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits. In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters. Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week,  the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year , or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.

ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said. According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown. \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\"  Noem posted on X  last week. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\" The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid,  according to Noem ; funds will be appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year. —  Ximena Bustillo , NPR If you're flying soon … Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job. This week they officially missed their first full paycheck since the shutdown began.  Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages  disrupt flights across the country . Air traffic controllers  helped to end the last government shutdown , and could help end this one as well. According to NPR's Joel Rose, the Transportation Department says  there has been an uptick in the number of controllers  who are calling in sick. The Transportation Department says that federal subsidies for rural air travel will continue through Nov. 18,  reports Alaska Public Media's Eric Stone . The department previously said it had enough funding to continue the program through Sunday. Read more on  what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown, here   The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region. Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country: Alaska The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [ Alaska Public Media ] About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states.

The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh,  according to state data . [ LAist ] The shutdown of the federal government  has brought  the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites  across California:  Muir Woods is fully closed . Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they  didn't learn the plan  until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down.  Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors . [ KQED ] Colorado Sites and lands in Colorado  operated by the National Park Service are open , but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website. [ Colorado Public Radio ] In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating  under its shutdown plan,  which would furlough thousands of employees. [ Colorado Public Radio ] Court documents show almost 200 Colorado-based positions that the Interior Department wants to cut.

[ WSHU ] Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are  asking Lamont to consider using it  to help offset the federal shortfall. Legislative leaders are considering appropriating the money during a special session next month. [ WSHU ] Georgia For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance,  Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said.  The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [ GPB ] Georgia farmers could also face delays in  block grant funding and commodity data  they rely on during the time-sensitive season of planting and harvesting. [ NPR ] Hawaii University of Hawaiʻi is paying affected employees  out of pocket during shutdown .

destruction \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 8:35 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Cuba — The rumble of large machinery, whine of chain saws and chopping of machetes echoed through communities across the northern Caribbean on Thursday as they dug out from the destruction of Hurricane Melissa and surveyed the damage left behind. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In Jamaica, government workers and residents began clearing roads in a push to reach dozens of isolated communities in the island's southeast that sustained a direct hit from one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record. Stunned residents wandered about, some staring at their roofless homes and waterlogged belongings strewn around them. \"I don't have a house now,\" said Sylvester Guthrie, a resident of Lacovia in the southern parish of St. Elizabeth, as he held onto his bicycle, the only possession of value left after the storm. Emergency relief flights began landing at Jamaica's main international airport, which reopened late Wednesday, as crews distributed water, medicine and other basic supplies. Helicopters dropped food as they thrummed above communities where the storm flattened homes, wiped out roads and destroyed bridges, cutting them off from assistance. \"The entire Jamaica is really broken because of what has happened,\" Education Minister Dana Morris Dixon said. Police said at least 14 people have died in Jamaica, and they expected the death toll to keep rising. In one isolated community, residents pleaded with officials to remove the body of one victim tangled in a tree. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       More than 13,000 people remained crowded into shelters, with 72% of the island without power and only 35% of mobile phone sites in operation, officials said. People clutched cash as they formed long lines at the few gas stations and supermarkets open in affected areas. \"We understand the frustration, we understand your anxiety, but we ask for your patience,\" said Daryl Vaz, Jamaica's telecommunications and energy minister. Water trucks have been mobilized to serve many of Jamaica's rural communities that are not connected to the government's utility system, Water Minister Matthew Samuda said. Slow recovery in Cuba In Cuba, heavy equipment began to clear blocked roads and highways and the military helped rescue people trapped in isolated communities and at risk from landslides. No deaths were reported after the Civil Defense evacuated more than 735,000 people across eastern Cuba ahead of the storm. Residents were slowly starting to return home Thursday. The town of El Cobre in the eastern province of Santiago de Cuba was one of the hardest hit. Home to some 7,000 people, it is also the site of the Basilica of Our Lady of Charity, the patron saint of Cuba who is deeply venerated by Catholics and practitioners of Santería, an Afro-Cuban religion. \"We went through this very badly. So much wind, so much wind. Zinc roofs were torn off. Some houses completely collapsed. It was a disaster,\" said Odalys Ojeda, a 61-year-old retiree, as she looked up at the sky from her living room where the roof and other parts of the house were torn away. Even the basilica wasn't spared. \"Here at the sanctuary, the carpentry, stained glass and even the masonry suffered extensive damage,\" Father Rogelio Dean Puerta said. A televised Civil Defense meeting chaired by President Miguel Díaz-Canel did not provide an official estimate of the damage. However, officials from the affected provinces — Santiago, Granma, Holguín, Guantánamo, and Las Tunas — reported losses of roofs, power lines and fiber optic telecommunications cables, as well as roads cut off, isolating communities, and heavy losses in banana, cassava and coffee plantations. Many communities were still without electricity, internet and telephone service because of downed transformers and power lines. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In an unusual statement Thursday, the U.S. State Department said the United States was \"ready to assist the Cuban people.\" A press release said the U.S. \"is prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance directly and through local partners who can deliver it more effectively to those in need.\" The statement did not specify how the cooperation would be coordinated or whether contact had been made with the Cuban government, with which it maintains a bitter conflict that includes six decades of economic and financial sanctions. Death and flooding in Haiti Melissa also unleashed catastrophic flooding in Haiti, where at least 30 people were reported killed and 20 others were missing, mostly in the country's southern region. Some 15,000 people also remained in shelters. \"It is a sad moment for the country,\" said Laurent Saint-Cyr, president of Haiti's transitional presidential council. He said officials expect the death toll to rise and noted that the government was mobilizing resources to search for people and provide emergency relief. Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said Hurricane Melissa killed at least 20 people, including 10 children, in Petit-Goâve, where more than 160 homes were damaged and 80 others destroyed. Steven Guadard said Melissa killed his entire family in Petit-Goâve, including four children ranging in age from 1-month to 8-years-old. Michelet Dégange, who has lived in Petit-Goâve for three years, said Melissa left him homeless. \"There is no place to rest the body; we are hungry,\" he said. \"The authorities don't think about us. I haven't closed my eyes since the bad weather began.\" When Melissa came ashore in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane with top winds of 185 mph (295 kph) on Tuesday, it tied strength records for Atlantic hurricanes making landfall, both in wind speed and barometric pressure. Melissa was a Category 2 storm with top sustained winds near 105 mph (165 kph) Thursday night and was moving northeast at 32 mph (51 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. The hurricane was centered about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west-southwest of Bermuda. Melissa brushed past the southeast Bahamas on Wednesday, forcing officials to evacuate 1,400 people ahead of the storm. Melissa was forecast to pass near or to the west of Bermuda late Thursday and may strengthen further before weakening Friday. Bermuda's international airport was to close Thursday evening and reopen Friday at noon, while all schools on the wealthy British territory were ordered closed. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95823","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:19:00-04:00","title":"Trump administration sets lowest-ever cap on refugee admissions to U.S.","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has drastically reduced the U.S. refugee cap to 7,500 for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2025 — the lowest level since 1980 — and has limited admissions primarily to Afrikaners from South Africa and others who faced illegal or unjust discrimination.

By Ximena Bustillo \n        \n           Updated Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:19 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration is drastically cutting the number of  refugees  it will admit to the U.S., capping it at 7,500 for the current fiscal year. That's the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was established in 1980. The U.S. wants to primarily admit Afrikaners from South Africa, according to a notification  in the Federal Register  filed on Thursday, and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" The administration has largely paused the U.S. refugee resettlement program so far this year, with the exception of a streamlined process of resettlement for white South Africans. Several hundred from the group have been resettled across the U.S.  since March . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response, some resettlement groups have been quick to voice concern over the lack of resources and limits on admission of those from other countries. Others have  shuttered their services , changing the landscape of the refugee resettlement process. Thursday's notification, which covers the fiscal year that started October 1, does not provide a reason for the lower cap, beyond mentioning previous Trump administration policies on refugees, including pausing admissions overall and barring admissions from countries seen as threats to U.S. security and welfare. \"The Trump administration has long expressed its intention to end Biden's abuse of the refugee program,\" a Trump administration official said in a statement. \"No refugees will be admitted in [fiscal year] 26 until the appropriate consultations with Congress are held, which are being delayed because certain members of Congress insisted on  shutting down  the government.\" Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state,  previously told reporters  that criteria for bringing in refugees included making sure that they did not pose a national security challenge and could be easily assimilated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,\" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, said in a statement. \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility.\" The Biden administration had set the refugee cap at 125,000 for fiscal year 2025. Senate Democrats, including Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Trump administration disobeyed the law by not consulting with Congress on the refugee cap before imposing it. The administration's lack of consultation \"demonstrates its tacit acknowledgement that this decision is indefensible,\" they wrote in a statement. \"President Trump's move undermines the role that America has long played in the world as a beacon of stability and a refuge for those fleeing genocide, political persecution and war crimes.\" Push for higher caps Refugee advocates have spent the year pushing for a broader range of admissions beyond Afrikaners, including admitting people from other countries who had already been vetted to arrive in the U.S. \"It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,\" said Sharif Aly, president of the International Refugee Assistance Project. He said that the number of those with confirmed travel plans to the U.S. is greater than the new refugee cap. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The admission of Afrikaners to the U.S. has drawn scrutiny from resettlement agencies in the U.S., who have faced  sharp budget , resource, and personnel cuts since President Trump took office. Among his first executive actions, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program. Various agencies including the State Department have also paused disbursing funding for  critical services for other refugees, such as the home, job and school assistance  the Afrikaners are poised to receive. The pause also sent the refugee resettlement agencies into turmoil as refugees already cleared to arrive in the U.S. received notice their flights had been cancelled. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Among those left in limbo were  Afghans who worked with the U.S. military , a move that some Republicans have criticized.

It is another marker of the Trump administration's disruptive force throughout the media. NPR alleges that last spring, CPB unlawfully yanked away a planned three-year contract worth $36 million in the face of intense pressure from the White House to sever ties with the radio network. As NPR presented evidence in court hearings on Tuesday and Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss indicated a deep skepticism of CPB's argument that it  sharply reversed course  on the merits. The most plausible explanation, Moss said, was that CPB was hoping to survive. \"I am not sure I have received an answer at all to the question of what changed from April 2nd to April 4th, other than the fact that CPB was looking for ways to try and ingratiate itself with the administration and perhaps folks on the Hill in a desire to survive,\" Moss said at Thursday's court hearing, according to a transcript, \"and that it was perceived that the votes and the support that CPB needed would come from those who were hostile to the content of NPR's speech.\" The CPB is the nonprofit that funneled federal dollars to public media until this month, as Congress and the president acted this summer to halt all $1.1 billion in planned future subsidies. Only a skeleton crew remains at the corporation. President Trump had been in the White House barely two months when he began attacking NPR and its TV counterpart PBS on social media as \"radical left MONSTERS.\" On May 1, he followed up with an  executive order to stop all federal dollars  from going to them. In response,  NPR and three member stations in Colorado sued  both the Trump administration and CPB, alleging their First Amendment rights were being violated. The portion of the lawsuit headed to trial does not involve the subsidies, but a separate contract to provide satellite and distribution services for public radio stations. NPR has operated it for four decades under a series of contracts with CPB. Moss said he had an open mind about the final merits of the two sides' arguments but ordered the trial because he thought NPR's argument was credible enough that he didn't want to take more time assessing its case. As the judge reiterated his skepticism of CPB's case, the corporation's trial attorney, Joseph Lipchitz, disclosed he had been negotiating a potential resolution of the lawsuit with NPR's legal team. A rush to get a deal, then a change of heart In late March, CPB had heard rumors of the possibility of an executive order against public media but was uncertain what form it would take. With that in mind, on April 2, CPB's board authorized its officials to work out the fine print of a fresh contract with NPR. A top CPB official, Kathy Merritt, called NPR's executive overseeing the satellite and distribution system and told him not to trip up the negotiations over minor matters, citing the urgency to get the money approved. (Merritt affirmed this account during a sworn deposition last week.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The next day, at an in-person meeting, a top White House budget official told CPB's board chairperson and two senior executives of her \"intense dislike for NPR.\" Memoranda about the meeting reflect the White House official, Katie Sullivan, also said \"it would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bath water,\" according to legal documents NPR filed in court. The day after that, April 4, CPB's board reversed itself, deciding that the radio satellite and distribution system had to be operated by an entity separate from NPR. CPB asked NPR to come up with plans to spin off the division, court filings show; NPR declined but bid for the project nonetheless. Behind the scenes, CPB's chairperson, Ruby Calvert, was \"adamant that she doesn't want funding to go to NPR,\" according to an April 12 email from Merritt to a colleague brought to light in the litigation. \"Something has been fundamentally missing\" On April 13, CPB's chief of staff, Debra Sanchez, wrote that she wasn't sure how to explain the requirement that it spin off its satellite and distribution system, called PRSS, court documents show. \"Something has been fundamentally missing for me ... and it's the 'because' statement,\" she wrote to colleagues. \"In particular, the 'local stations would be better served by having PRSS as an independent entity' which begs the question... because?\" Newly hired Republican consultant Carl Forti advised CPB on key themes to embrace in dealing with the administration: \"CPB has taken proactive steps to rein in what it sees as bias at NPR and PBS,\" according to court filings. The consultant stated that CPB should stress it had \"already taken steps to address the administration's concerns\" including by \"[w]ithholding interconnection funds from NPR.\" The word \"interconnection\" is a shorthand for the satellite and distribution system. Forti's memo also stated that CPB should note it had stopped grants for specific NPR newsroom efforts. CPB had subsidized international reporting and, last year, after allegations of bias led Congressional Republicans to blast NPR, a new senior editorial review team. Clayton Barsoum, CPB's chief lobbying executive, affirmed the memo in a note to Sanchez, writing, \"This looks good to me,\" court filings show. CPB argues it is a bulwark against political pressure In September, the corporation announced it was awarding a longer, bigger contract — $57 million over five years — to a new consortium that includes major public radio stations, a public radio distributor and an industry consulting firm. It said it was doing so to address long-standing concerns about NPR's performance. CPB attorney Lipschitz argued in court that the corporation has acted as a resolute bulwark for public media, including NPR, against political pressure. He noted that  CPB had separately sued Trump  over his attempt to fire corporation board members. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In his remarks at the hearings Tuesday and Thursday, Moss cast doubt on the credibility of that defense, repeatedly questioning the quick-twitch decision to demand that NPR no longer run the distribution system after such a longstanding arrangement. \"All of a sudden there was this change. And so what happened to cause this change?\" the judge asked Tuesday. \"I have to say, the most plausible explanation for what's happening here, is that everything is not quite as linear as \"We're for or against it'.\" \"CPB is understandably trying to survive,\" Moss said. \"There are a lot of materials that are in the record here that say there are a lot of strategies going on: 'What do we do? One thing we do is distance ourselves from NPR, because they don't like NPR'.\" \"A desire to earn some brownie points\" On Thursday, Moss underscored his thinking. \"At this point, I am not convinced that there is any real explanation of what changed other than the political climate and desire to try and earn some brownie points with those who CPB saw as attacking it,\" Moss said. In that April memo reproduced in court filings, CPB's consultant Forti came up with a message to convey to senators whom Trump was urging to pull all funding for public media: \"a. We understand the new world. \"b. We are responsive to the new world. \"c. We are trying to limit funds direct to NPR and PBS for biased content.\" Barsoum had endorsed the memo. Yet CPB officials felt they could not make that case publicly, evidence presented by NPR in court shows. Behind the scenes, CPB officials were asking Forti how they could best present their decision, without referring to the political firestorm around them. \"I don't think we are comfortable with the approach to publicly state we cut funding to NPR, so the bland statement might be where we land,\" Sanchez, the CPB chief of staff, wrote, according to materials filed in court. Moss ordered a brief expedited trial on this portion of the litigation and also ordered that CPB set aside $36 million, which it could not touch until the case was resolved. Assuming there is no settlement between the parties, Moss will assess it himself, instead of a jury, in what is called a bench trial. It is expected to last three to four days.

nationally \n         By Selena Simmons-Duffin \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 9:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth will be dramatically restricted by the Trump administration under new proposals by the Department of Health and Human Services. NPR has obtained the draft text of a  proposed rule  that would prohibit federal Medicaid reimbursement for medical care provided to transgender patients younger than age 18. It also prohibits reimbursement through the Children's Health Insurance Program or CHIP for patients under age 19. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       An  additional proposed rule  would go even further, blocking all Medicaid and Medicare funding for any services at hospitals that provide pediatric gender-affirming care. The rules are being prepared for public release in early November, according to an employee at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The employee asked that NPR not use their name because they fear professional retribution for speaking to the media without authorization. An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about the planned timing of the proposed rules' release. A near ban in all states Both supporters and opponents of transgender rights agree that, taken together, the forthcoming rules could make access to pediatric gender-affirming care across the country extremely difficult, if not impossible. The care is already banned in  27 states . \"These rules would be a significant escalation in the Trump administration's attack on access to transgender health care,\" says  Katie Keith , director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University. \"I think it's really, really important to note that nothing is changing immediately,\" she explains. \"These would be proposals that would go out for public comment, it would take months for the Trump administration to issue a final rule, and then, if past is prologue, we would see litigation over whatever the final rules are.\" Administration goals In his first days in office, President Trump signed an  executive order  declaring that the United States \"will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another.\" In the months since, HHS  released a report  critical of the research that supports access to this care. A federal suicide prevention lifeline specifically for transgender youth  was cancelled , as were  hundreds of millions  of dollars in scientific research funding related to LGBTQ people. Federal health officials warned  state Medicaid directors  to tread carefully, and the Department of Justice  announced subpoenas  of some children's hospitals and  threatened providers  with prosecution. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think these restrictions are very good,\" says Terry Schilling of the forthcoming rules. Schilling is president of the  American Principles Project , a conservative advocacy group. \"It's going to change the entire transgender industry, and it's going to take away a lot of their funding streams.\" He points to  an opinion poll  from the spring, which found 66% of the public opposes Medicaid coverage for this type of care for young people. \"They believe that if you want to get some type of sex-trait modification procedure, you should have to pay for it,\" Schilling says. \"The American people are fully behind this effort.\" Dramatic new expansion of power The proposal to condition a hospital's participation in Medicaid and Medicare on halting gender-affirming care for youth represents an \"unprecedented\" use of the executive branch's power to control what medical care is available in hospitals, says Keith. \"Because Medicare is such a significant portion of many hospitals' revenue,\" she explains, the rule would essentially force hospitals to end their gender care   programs for transgender youth. That would mean all of those programs' patients — whether they have Medicaid or private insurance — would lose access. This is not how the federal government normally uses this type of rule, Keith says. She served in the Biden administration on the Gender Policy Council, and worked on some \" conditions of participation \" regulations for Medicare and Medicaid, she says. \"They're so basic — it's like, you have to have a crash cart [with] enough medicine to help a pregnant woman in crisis.\" Instead of health and safety standards, this proposal would instruct hospitals \"to stop offering a certain type of care completely to a certain patient population,\" she says. Law professor  Katie Eyer  of Rutgers University questions whether such a rule would survive a court challenge. \"But if it were successful, I shudder to think what this administration would do with such a tool in their hands,\" she says. It could open the door for any White House to withhold all federal funding from hospitals over the provision of medical care that it disfavors. \"The writing has been on the wall that this has been coming,\" says  Lindsey Dawson , director of LGBTQ Health Policy at KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization. Yet the timing of the release has been a mystery for months. Notice of both proposed rules — though not the rules themselves — appeared on a government register over the summer, and it's been unclear why they have yet to be released, Dawson says. 'An obsessive focus' The administration's efforts on transgender issues stretch far beyond health policy and beyond youth. The Federal Trade Commission recently  hosted a workshop  \"on unfair or deceptive trade practices in 'gender-affirming care' for minors.\" The military forced out  transgender servicemembers . Universities have been told their federal funding is  contingent  on adopting anti-transgender policies on issues like bathroom access. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Even the impending lapse in funding for food assistance, or SNAP, is linked to Democratic support for \"gender mutilation procedures,\" according to a banner on the  Department of Agriculture website . \"It's endless,\" says Eyer. \"It really has been an obsessive focus that's been deployed across the administration.\" The warning letters and cancelled grants and more have had a significant chilling effect. In the states where the care is still legal,  many clinics and hospitals  have ended their programs for gender-affirming care. If these rules were to take effect, the remaining programs would likely follow suit. \"There are real people behind all this,\" says Eyer, who is also the parent of a transgender child. \"People are really scared and suffering as a result of this onslaught of attacks on the trans community.\" It's still legal, although access is shrinking Gender-affirming care for youth — including puberty blocking medications, hormones, and rarely, surgery — does not actually violate federal law, Eyer notes. And, despite recent  political pressure , no major U.S. medical organization has altered their clinical guidance that supports these treatments as appropriate and safe. Approximately  3% of youth in the U.S.  identify as transgender or nonbinary, although not all of them seek medical treatment related to their identity. Notably, in Utah, a  state-commissioned analysis  of the evidence recently came to the opposite conclusion as the Trump administration's transgender report. University of Utah researchers found that there was ample evidence of benefits and safety for these treatments, and wrote that policy restrictions on this care for youth \"cannot be justified based on the quantity or quality of medical science findings or concerns about potential regret in the future.\" The draft text of the proposed federal rule obtained by NPR does not mention the Utah analysis, nor does it cite the American Academy of Pediatrics, whose guidelines  also support  access to the care. In Eyer's view, the public release of these rules will offer the opportunity for them to be legally challenged. \"It will be subject to  'arbitrary and capricious' review , and a court will presumably take a close look at the factual basis that actually underlies it,\" she says. \"That is actually preferable to what we've had up until now, which is coercion without law.\" Diane Webber edited this story. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/chinese-surveillance-silicon-valley-trump-administration-congress-21c5f961b1fd22f9a9e563ebe64e5582","dateOfPublication":"2023-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:45:12+00:00","title":"Growing Concerns Over Human Rights in Immigration Detention Centers","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The national government has faced mounting criticism for its immigration policies, particularly regarding the treatment of asylum seekers in detention centers.

An AP investigation in September found that American companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known. “It’s driven by profit, and that’s why these strategic discussions have been silenced or delayed,” Zhou said. “I’m extremely disappointed. … this is a strategic failure by the United States.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Hundreds of millions in lobbying The sale of technology to China is contentious among both Republicans and Democrats, with some arguing for a harder stance. They are fighting a powerful opponent. An AP analysis of lobbying filings showed U.S. tech and telecom companies, as well as their trade associations, spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past two decades on lobbyists who listed key bills impacting China-related trade on their quarterly disclosure reports, among other issues.

Nvidia has also said that it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed its H20 AI chip for police surveillance. Intel, which partnered with a Chinese fingerprinting company as recently as last year , has said the company follows export control policies, and did not address details of its deal with the U.S. government. “The U.S. government’s investment is a passive ownership, with no board representation, governance or information rights,” Intel said in a statement. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); AMD did not respond. The White House and the Commerce and State departments also did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The AP investigation was based on dozens of open record requests, hundreds of pages of congressional testimony, lobbying disclosures and dozens of interviews with current and former Chinese and American executives, politicians, and former federal officials. Under the cloud services loophole, Chinese companies barred from accessing cutting-edge chips can use Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services overseas instead to train their AI models. Microsoft and AWS also both advertise the capacity to store video surveillance footage on their cloud services for Chinese customers.

And Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute , a government-backed research institute working on sensitive technologies such as encryption, sought access to $280,000 worth of Azure OpenAI cloud services from Microsoft. Even sanctioned Chinese companies can use AWS and Microsoft Azure to offer surveillance abilities to customers overseas. For example, despite U.S. sanctions over human rights abuses in Xinjiang in 2019, Dahua and Hikvision, China’s two largest surveillance companies, use AWS to offer networked surveillance abroad , according to marketing material on the company websites . Hikvision markets a video surveillance platform called “HikCentral” to private companies overseas, which can be also deployed on Azure, according to a post on Hikvision’s website this year . Microsoft denied providing services to Hikvision or partnering with them to provide services to others. OpenAI, which provides its advanced AI models through Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, said it was subject to Microsoft’s policies and doesn’t support China’s access to its services. AWS did not respond on the record to questions about the cloud services loophole. Another enduring loophole is in the restrictions passed after the Tiananmen massacre that didn’t include newer policing technologies, such as security cameras, surveillance drives, or facial recognition systems. In 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013, lawmakers introduced bills to try and close the loophole. All failed. The U.S. government under both Republican and Democratic presidents has made other attempts to regulate tech surveillance exports to China. In 2008, the Department of Commerce asked for comment on whether to include “biometric devices” and “integrated security systems” under controlled exports, but ran out of time before the next administration came in. In 2014 and 2015, it tried to tighten controls on surveillance products , but most fell through. In 2024, it sought to restrict exports of face-recognition systems and bar many more military, police, and intelligence end users from receiving U.S. goods, with no success. Some politicians on both sides of the aisle blame the failures in part on the money and political influence of tech companies. “I think we’ve been naive or complicit in the extreme,” said New Jersey GOP Rep. Chris Smith. The U.S., he said, has been “selling and conveying to a malevolent power the ability to destroy us and destroy like-minded Western democracies.” “What do all those companies all have in common? A big wallet,” said Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon. “That is as much as anything is what’s behind the fact we haven’t made as much progress.” A rickshaw driver transports wounded people, with the help of bystanders, to a nearby hospital in Beijing, on Sunday, June 4, 1989, after PLA soldiers fired rounds towards crowds gathered outside Tiananmen Square.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More A history of failures to close loopholes The first round of U.S. prohibitions on Chinese police came after the Tiananmen massacre and applied to “crime control and detection” equipment. They largely stopped U.S. companies from exporting goods to Chinese entities such as restraints, helmets, shields and batons. But the controls were narrowly confined to largely low-tech goods, leaving out advanced technologies that could be used by police and leading at times to puzzling priorities. U.S. regulators warned sex shops against shipping novelty gold handcuffs to China. At the same time, they broadly permitted Silicon Valley companies to sell routers, servers, software, and more recently, AI-powered surveillance systems to Chinese police. For example, despite explicit restrictions on fingerprint recognition systems, U.S. companies still were able to sell gear to process, store and compare fingerprints. In 2006, with bipartisan support, Smith introduced the Global Online Freedom Act to curtail the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance. Smith drew parallels with IBM’s sale of computing gear to Nazi Germany, which has been well documented by historians . IBM told AP in a follow-up statement that the claim that IBM knowingly collaborated with Nazi Germany was “false and has been rejected by credible historians.” Associations representing the tech and telecommunications industries and dozens of companies stepped up their lobbying against Smith’s proposal, disclosures show. The companies argued the computers, servers and routers they sold in China were no different from what they sold to other countries. Industry groups and individual companies also submitted hundreds of comments to regulators, hoping to influence China-related export regulations. Smith’s bill went nowhere. Rep.

Tech sales to China continued, sometimes with direct government support. Numerous archived webpages show that the U.S. Commercial Service, the export-promoting arm of the Commerce Department, played a crucial role for more than a decade in connecting U.S. vendors to Chinese security agencies and key government officials, including through its marquee Gold Key Matching service. In 2004, the Commercial Service invited American companies selling security technologies and equipment to show off their products at a Chinese security exposition. Two years later, it advertised opportunities for American firms in the “safety and security” market , followed by another publication later describing market opportunities for foreign security products such as inspection control and guard communication systems . Archived webpages also show that under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the Commercial Service steadily promoted U.S. participation in policing trade shows , even those that showcased “biological identification technologies” or were initiated by the Chinese Communist Party. Under Bush, the Commerce Department in 2007 hosted a webinar about how to sell to the Chinese security market and promote surveillance tools to China’s public sector. For just $35, the federal agency could offer attendees “market entry-strategies and long-term market penetration plans,” an archived webpage shows. Jeanette Chu, who then worked at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and helped give the 2007 webinar, recalled sometimes having concerns. “I used to ask myself all the time, ‘what is the scary potential of each item?’” said Chu, now a national security and trade expert advising industry. Despite promises to nail shut Washington’s revolving door, President Barack Obama — like presidents before and after him — gave former industry lobbyists and allies top jobs, including Eric Hirschhorn in the Commerce Department, who represented a trade group that lobbied for tech companies exporting abroad. Hirschhorn wrote that Beijing’s surveillance abilities were nothing compared to the half-million surveillance cameras blanketing London. He was put in charge of the office that administers U.S. export controls.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More In an interview, Hirschhorn said export controls alone were an inefficient way to defend human rights. “You can use a computer to type an order or type a love note,” he told AP. “Are you not going to sell computers to China because one out of every 10,000 of them will be used to store data about a dissident?” In 2010, the U.S. State Department’s human rights report warned of “police surveillance, harassment and detentions of activists.” Yet U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman led a mission to promote American business interests in the far-west region of Xinjiang, where authorities had arrested thousands of ethnic Uyghurs and cut internet access after deadly unrest the year before . Huntsman did not respond to requests for comment. That same year, the Commercial Service spotlighted opportunities for U.S. companies to sell equipment directly to China’s central government “to install a city-wide infrastructure of security, surveillance, and alarm systems” on its website. A 2015 State Department draft plan for “smart city” cooperation obtained by AP proposed that China and the U.S. collaborate on joint research, such as on crime and “urban security,” and include private sector players such IBM. Additional documents AP obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request show the U.S. government also sought active counter-terrorism cooperation with China, which gave tech companies a chance for closer contact with Chinese authorities even as Beijing broadly labelled protest or dissent among Uyghurs as terrorism. Documents reviewed by the AP show how the U.S. government helped promote opportunities in the Chinese security market to American companies. (AP video Marshall Ritzel) Kevin Wolf, then an assistant secretary in charge of export controls at Commerce, said as news about human rights abuses inside China kept surfacing, he worried about U.S. innovations falling into the wrong hands. Wolf said he began drafting a rule to regulate certain surveillance gear sales in early 2016. “The problem I was struggling with was, mass surveillance can involve everyday ordinary common items: it’s cameras, it’s software, it’s facial recognition stuff and 99 percent of all of those applications are perfectly benign,” said Wolf, now a compliance attorney for industry. “So if you were to say, ban cameras that can read someone’s face, you blow up international trade.” Wolf’s colleagues told him the draft rule was too complicated, Wolf said, and it foundered. .headline {\n            font-family: \"AP\";\n            font-size: 28px;\n            color: #333;\n            text-decoration: none;\n            text-align: center;\n            display: block;\n            background-color: #ffffff;\n            padding: 5px;\n        }\n        \n        .headline:hover {\n            color: #0066cc;\n        }\n        \n        .image-link img {\n            width: auto;\n        } Photo Gallery: Life Under Surveillance In 2018, Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act, giving Commerce authority to make export control rules about advanced technologies. In 2019 and 2020, the Trump administration sanctioned some Chinese officials and surveillance firms over atrocities in Xinjiang. But sales of surveillance equipment continued, albeit at a slower pace — though references to working with the Chinese police would disappear from annual Commerce Department reports for U.S. industry. In 2021, Joe Biden put out an executive order describing Chinese surveillance tech companies as “unusual and extraordinary threats” that enabled serious human rights abuses. In his final months in office, Biden’s administration drew up sprawling rules for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop AI systems. Commerce also floated an updated version of Wolf’s draft rule to keep facial recognition and other mass surveillance tools from reaching military and intelligence agencies and companies, including in China. But once again, Washington lobbyists, lawyers and politicians pushed back. “The result would slow business considerably and likely result in the loss of customers that do not present any national security or human rights concerns,” said a Chamber of Commerce filing from late last year. The proposed rule, in the end, stalled out. Gulbahar Haitiwaji, an ethnic Uyghur living in France, says little has changed since she testified to Congress in 2023 urging the U.S. government to “stop American companies from continuing to be complicit in surveilling our people”.

After she was released in 2019, she still found herself living in what she calls “an open-air prison,” with every move monitored, until she finally left Xinjiang later that year. She said U.S. tech companies show little accountability. “It’s truly disappointing that the United States, one of the most powerful countries in the world, would sell such technology to China despite knowing the potential for serious consequences,” Haitiwaji said. —- Burke reported from San Francisco and Washington, Kang reported from Beijing and Tau reported from Washington.

senators join Democrats to rebuke Trump on tariffs for a third time this week \n         By Claudia Grisales \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 3:31 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In a series of three votes this week, a slim majority of the GOP-led Senate delivered a rare, bipartisan rebuke of President Trump's use of emergency powers to set tariffs on Canada, Brazil and other countries. The last of these votes — a measure approved Thursday to roll back global tariffs announced by Trump  in April  — passed by a margin of 51 to 47. Democrats cleared the measure with support from four Republicans: Susan Collins of Maine, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Kentucky's Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul. \"The way that the president has imposed the tariffs is leading to nothing but chaos,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the lead sponsor of the measure, said ahead of the vote. Kaine said the strategy behind Trump's tariff policy amounted to, \"Announce tariffs on everyone, then announce that they may be suspended or delayed while I work out one-on-one deals.\" Earlier this week, the same four Republican senators joined Democrats to approve resolutions to terminate tariffs on  Brazil  and Canada that were announced using emergency powers. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., joined Democrats to terminate the Brazil tariffs, which he argued specifically had no rational basis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The vast majority of Senate Republicans voted against the measures, with many saying that at this point they're counterproductive to the president's tariff program. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said  Trump's new plans to lower China's tariffs  Thursday were a good reminder. Trump announced the plans after meeting in South Korea with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.  \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit. President Trump already announced new trade deals,\" Crapo said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. \"Other deals are, hopefully, forthcoming.\" However, the success of this week's resolution votes, which only needed a simple majority to pass, may not go far. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., installed a special rule to block such votes in the House, so they're currently unlikely to reach the floor. Even if they were to somehow pass the House, President Trump would almost certainly veto them. Still, the vote marked a test of support for the president's tariff policies among Republicans, reflecting unease inside the party about their impacts on the U.S. economy, and specifically the farming and manufacturing sectors. It came ahead of  arguments at the Supreme Court  this fall in a case challenging Trump's authority to put sweeping tariffs in place using emergency powers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Thursday's vote wasn't the first time Senate Republicans took up Trump's authority to set global tariffs. In April, a similar measure failed 49 to 49. That same month,  a measure to block tariffs on Canada drew a simple majority in the Senate . \"Since then our nation's trade policy has looked pretty much like a dog chasing a squirrel,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a lead co-sponsor of the global tariffs resolution, said on the Senate floor on Thursday. \"More tariffs threatened, added, taken away, thousands of packages being destroyed because the customs service wasn't prepared, secretive deals to lift tariffs for certain companies and products that have influence at the White House.\" The Republicans who broke ranks did so despite a lobbying push by Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and urged them to back the president's policies. Vance told reporters after the lunch meeting that the tariffs are critical leverage for Trump in international negotiations. But Tillis, for example, was one of those Republicans not convinced when it came at least to the Brazil tariffs. \"I just don't think there's a rational basis for it,\" Tillis said. Trump triggered the Brazil tariffs this summer to pressure the country's government to end what he called a \"witch hunt\" against his ally, former far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.

fields of cempasuchil flowers, the luminescent orange petals of which will soon cloak everything from city streets to cemeteries across Mexico . Here, in the winding canals and farms on the fringes of Mexico City, the flower also known as the Mexican marigold has been farmed for generations, and takes the spotlight every year in the country’s Day of the Dead celebrations . But as 50-year-old Ortiz and other farmers busily bundle clusters of the plant to sell in markets around the capital, they quietly wonder what will be left of their livelihood down the line. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); That’s because cempasuchil growers say they’ve been left reeling by torrential rains, stretching drought and other impacts from climate change — caused by the burning of fuels like gas, oil and coal — that have grown increasingly common.

This year alone, cempasuchil producers said they lost up to half their flower crop from heavy rains and flooding. “This year, we lost a lot. We struggled to even grow the cempasuchil. There were moments in which we didn’t have the money to buy fertilizer we needed,” Ortiz said. “With the cempasuchil plants, we’ve sometimes been left with nothing.” ‘Flower of the dead’ The orange flower has become a symbol of the country’s celebrations that take place every Nov. 1 and 2. Also known as the “flower of the dead”, the cempasuchil is believed to be a point of connection between the worlds of the dead and the living, with bright petals that light the path of dead souls to the altars set out by their family. The flowers are also a crucial economic engine across Mexico, which commerce groups predict will rake in nearly 2.7 million dollars for farmers in 2025. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Ortiz and her family began growing the flower 30 years ago in their small plot of land in Xochimilco, a rural borough in the south of Mexico City where residents have continued to carry on ancient farming techniques using canals that wind through farmlands like a maze.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Every year, locals begin to plant the marigold seeds in July, and grow the plants as the rainy season winds down. But they say that they’ve been dealt a heavy blow for consecutive years as heavy rains, drought, floods and other climate shifts have made it increasingly difficult to keep their crops alive. This year, torrential rains stretching on for months wiped out more than 37,000 acres of crops across the country, according to government figures. In a visit to cempasuchil fields earlier this month in Xochimilco, Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said that as many of 2 million marigold plants were put at risk. Despite that, she said that production this year simultaneously broke a record of 6 million plants as farmers ramp up to meet increasing demand even as growing the flower has become more precarious. Ortiz said the excess of rain has brought on pests, diseases and rotted the roots of her plants. She estimates she lost at least 30% of her crop, while others say they’ve lost closer to 50%. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The family has been forced to drop money on insecticides, fertilizer and more to save their crops. As they have, razor thin profit margins have turned into losses, and they’ve had to cut back on basics like beef and sweets to make ends meet. “If I were to take a hard look at all our losses, I’d be incredibly disillusioned and even not want to grow them anymore,” she said. “We’re just trying to push forward and make sure this keeps going on.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Adapting to climate change Just down the road from Ortiz’s farm, government scientists are searching for long-term solutions beyond the short-term economic relief provided by the local government. In a small seed bank known as Toxinachcal, men in white suits meticulously pick through sprouts in a lab dish. The scientists have been at work for a year and a half saving up thousands of seed variants of native plant species, including 20 variants of cempasuchil, in jars lining giant freezers in the hopes that the storage facility will be a key tool in fighting the most adverse effects of climate change. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Biologist Clara Soto Cortés, head of the seed bank, said part of the reason that the crop has been devastated is because farmers in recent years have elected to use a hybrid marigold seed variant from the United States.

But that means farmers have turned away from sturdier, native breeds, which have longer stocks and widely vary in color, size and texture. The genetic diversity of these Mexican breeds makes them more resilient to drastic climate shifts like the ones seen this year, Soto said. “These native seeds have adapted to different geographies, in high altitudes and low, in places where there’s a lot of rain or there’s none at all, or where they need to be resistant to insects,” she said. “The (hybrid) seeds have been bred for another purpose. It doesn’t have the genetic diversity needed to take on climate change.” If more climate events, like the floods that roiled producers wipe out an entire crop, Soto said the bank will make seeds available to local producers to recover their crops – this time with a more resilient variant that their ancestors have been farming for centuries. Carrying on an ancient tradition Meanwhile, growers are scrambling to bounce back in the short term, saying the losses also represent a threat to the farming tradition their families have struggled to maintain on the edge of the dense city of 23 million people. Carlos Jiménez, 61, has long worked the fields of Xochimilco, but began to grow the shorter marigold plants eight years ago when he noticed the hybrid was more marketable. As he’s lost more crops and gotten lower prices for the plants because of the mildew gathering at their roots, he said he’s begun considering ways to adapt, like building greenhouses. “The plants get sick, they rot, and our business is snuffed out,” Jiménez said. “And with it goes our tradition because it’s our economy.” Flor Jimenez waters her crop of cempasuchil flowers in preparation for Day of the Dead celebrations in Xochimilco where marigolds are grown on the outskirts of Mexico City, Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025.

But their losses mean they have no money to build added infrastructure. Her family and other farmers have called on local authorities for help, but say they’ve received just pennies on the dollar of what they need to bounce back. Though the local government has said it continues to work to help offset the blow felt by farmers. She said she’s begun to look at other crops she might be able to farm that are more resilient than the crinkled orange flowers. Others like Jiménez said that while the roots of plants may rot around him, for now he’s holding strong. “This plant has a deeper meaning to our lost loved ones,” he said. “These are traditions we carry down from our ancestors.

After a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump said he would cut tariffs on the Asian economic giant and China would, in turn, purchase 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually for the next three years. The Republican president claimed his trade negotiations would secure “prosperity and security to millions of Americans.” But back in Washington, senators — several from Trump’s Republican Party — have demonstrated their dissent with Trump’s tariff tactics by passing a series of resolutions this week that would nullify the national emergencies that Trump has declared to justify the import taxes. Already this week, the Senate approved resolutions to end tariffs imposed on Brazil and Canada.

Plus, Trump would surely veto legislation that inhibits his power over trade policy, meaning the legislation won’t ultimately take effect. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Democrats can force a vote but not a result But Democrats have still been able to force the Senate to take up an uncomfortable topic for their Republican colleagues. “American families are being squeezed by prices going up and up and up,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, in a floor speech. He added that “in many ways, red states in rural areas are being hit the hardest,” and pointed to economic strain being put on farmers and manufacturers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said that Americans shouldn’t be fooled by Trump’s announcement. “Donald Trump has folded, leaving American families and farmers and small businesses to deal with the wreckage from his blunders, from his erratic on again off again tariff policies,” said the New York Democrat. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); How Republicans see Trump’s trade policy Overall, there has been little movement among Republicans to oppose Trump’s import taxes publicly. A nearly identical resolution failed in April on a tied vote after Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was absent. On Thursday, McConnell and Paul, as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voted along with all Democrats to pass the resolution. Those four Republicans helped advance similar resolutions this week to end the tariffs on Brazil and Canada. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also voted in favor of the resolution applying to Brazil , but otherwise, GOP senators have held the line this week behind the president. “I agree with my colleagues that tariffs should be more targeted to avoid harm to Americans,” said Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, in a floor speech. Yet, he added that Trump’s negotiations “are bearing fruit” and praised his announcement that Beijing would allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans again. Republicans representing farm states were especially enthused by the announcement that China would be purchasing 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually, starting with 10 million metric tons for the rest of this year. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said the deal with China “absolutely” justifies Trump’s use of tariff threats to negotiate trade policy with other nations. He called the announcement “huge news” for Kansas farmers, but also acknowledged that they would still probably need financial help as they deal with the strain of losing their biggest customer for soybeans and sorghum. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “It’s not like you can snap your finger and send over $15 billion worth of sorghum and soybeans together overnight,” he said. China had been the largest purchaser of U.S. soybeans until this year. It purchased almost 27 million metric tons in 2024 , so Trump’s negotiated deal only guarantees to return soybean exports to China to less than their previous level. Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, called the purchase agreement a “start.” Asked whether he agreed with Trump’s assessment that his meeting with Xi had been a runaway success, Cramer smiled and said the president “is nothing if not optimistic.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/cisco-falun-gong-china-human-rights-abuses-aedf0b83212d0692e6fafe29345c04a1","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:59:15+00:00","title":"Republican Lawmakers Urge Supreme Court to Allow Lawsuit Against Cisco Over China Surveillance Allegations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two prominent Republican congressmen, Chris Smith and John Moolenaar, have urged the Trump administration to support a lawsuit against Cisco, alleging that the company helped build surveillance tools used by China’s government to persecute members of the Falun Gong movement.

In a Wednesday letter to the Trump administration’s top Supreme Court litigator, D. John Sauer, Reps. Chris Smith of New Jersey and John Moolenaar of Michigan urged the administration to side with the Falun Gong plaintiffs and press the court to allow the lawsuit to go to trial. Smith co-chairs the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, while Moolenaar is the chairman of a special China committee set up in the House of Representatives — and both are prominent critics of Beijing’s human rights record. The letter cited an AP investigation last month that showed American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, saying it “underscore(s) the need to deter American firms from supplying technology to facilitate the CCP’s human rights abuses.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The decision ultimately rests with the Supreme Court whether to hear the challenge brought by Cisco arguing that U.S. law does not permit such a suit.

Follow on “The allegation that an American tech company custom-designed a tool to facilitate the violent persecution of a religious minority by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is a serious one,” the two lawmakers wrote in a letter to Sauer. “We believe the Plaintiffs deserve the chance to prove their claims.” “We have a longstanding commitment to uphold and respect human rights for all people and if the 2023 ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court stands, it opens the floodgates for suits against U.S. corporations merely for legal exports of off-the-shelf goods and services,” said a spokesperson for Cisco. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The case has a long and winding history dating back more than a decade. In 2008, documents leaked to the press showed Cisco saw the “Golden Shield” as a sales opportunity, quoting a Chinese official calling the Falun Gong an “evil cult.” A Cisco presentation reviewed by AP from the same year said its products could identify over 90% of Falun Gong material on the web. Other presentations reviewed by AP show that Cisco represented Falun Gong material as a “threat” and built out a national information system to track Falun Gong believers. In 2011, Falun Gong members sued Cisco, alleging the company tailored technology for Beijing that they knew would be used to track, detain and torture believers. The issue before the Supreme Court is whether an American company can be held liable under two separate laws for aiding and abetting human rights violations. Cisco argues it isn’t liable under those laws, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) or the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), but a federal appeals court rejected the company’s arguments in 2023, allowing the case to continue. Now Cisco is asking the Supreme Court to throw out that ruling and stop the lawsuit. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); In recent years, the Supreme Court and presidential administrations of both parties have been skeptical of lawsuits seeking to use U.S. courts as a venue to seek justice over the acts of foreign governments, especially those that took place abroad. In the case of Cisco, the Falun Gong members have argued that a substantial portion of Cisco’s activities involving China took place in the United States. An AP investigation this week found that the U.S. government across five Republican and Democratic administrations repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police and surveillance companies, even as activists warned such tools were being used to quash dissent , persecute religious groups and target minorities . freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Going into the long-heralded meeting Thursday between leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping , the sale of U.S. technology to China has been among the thorniest issues the U.S. faces, with billions of dollars and the future of tech dominance at stake . Trump said after the meeting that China will speak with Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia about purchasing their computer chips. Debate over the sale of technology to China has grown heated, with some arguing for a harder stance. American companies have pushed back against restrictions, arguing it will push China to develop its own domestic supply and strengthen its position in the global race for leadership in artificial intelligence. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); But many national security experts say selling such technology could assist China’s military and intelligence services. The plaintiffs’ lawyers make a similar case, citing Cisco marketing materials in China that promoted routers for use in tanks. If the Cisco suit is successful, it would signal that American companies can be held liable in some circumstances for abuse of their technologies overseas. —- Kang reported from Beijing and Tau reported from Washington.

remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Buckingham Palace said. After the king’s rare move, which follows years of shameful scandals, he will be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and not as a prince, and he will have to vacate his Royal Lodge mansion near Windsor Castle. Demand had been growing on the palace to oust the prince from Royal Lodge after he surrendered his use of the title Duke of York earlier this month over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, whose posthumous memoir hit bookstores last week. But the king went even further to punish him for serious lapses of judgment by removing the title of prince that he has held since birth as a child of a monarch, the late Queen Elizabeth II.

Andrew faced a new round of public outrage after emails emerged earlier this month showing he had remained in contact with Epstein longer than he previously admitted. That news was followed by publication of “Nobody’s Girl,” by Giuffre , who alleged she had sex with Andrew when she was 17. The book detailed three alleged sexual encounters with Andrew, who she said acted as if he believed “having sex with me was his birthright.” Andrew, 65, has long denied Giuffre’s claims , but stepped down from royal duties after a disastrous November 2019 BBC interview in which he attempted to rebut her allegations. Andrew paid millions in an out-of-court settlement in 2022 after Giuffre filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, he acknowledged Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); King couldn’t avoid the controversy Although Charles was involved in discussions with Andrew before he announced he would relinquish his dukedom two weeks ago, the king had largely managed to steer clear of the scandal until this week. After attending an event at Lichfield Cathedral on Monday, the king was heckled by a man who shouted questions about how long he had known about his brother and Epstein and then asked: “Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew?” The king did not respond and it wasn’t clear if he even heard the man, who was shouted down by others and eventually pulled from sight. But video of the incident made the evening news and was the source of embarrassing headlines the next morning. It’s the most dramatic royal departure since 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated the throne so he could marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. The couple were given the titles Duke and Duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in exile outside Britain. Prince Harry, despite renouncing his royal role, feuding with his family and moving to California, remains a prince and the Duke of Sussex. The move by the king means Andrew will no longer be a prince or known as His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, Earl of Inverness or Baron Killyleagh — all titles he held until now. Also gone are honors that include Order of the Garter and status as Knight Grand Cross of the Victorian Order. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); From favored son to tabloid fodder Andrew, who was said to be his mother’s favorite child, had once been the poster boy of the royal family, and his romantic links to a number of models and starlets during his youth were widely chronicled in the British press. His star status peaked after he flew missions as a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy during the 1982 Falklands War when British forces sailed to the south Atlantic to eject the Argentine military that had invaded the U.K. overseas territories. But he has also been dogged by decades of tawdry headlines about shady business deals, inappropriate behavior and controversial friendships.

In an open letter to LSU fans, Woodward said, “Our University will always hold a special place in my heart and I will never be too far from LSU.” “Others can recap or opine on my tenure and on my decisions over the last six years as Director of Athletics, but I will not,” Woodward said. “Rather, I will focus on the absolute joy that LSU Athletics brings to our state’s residents and to the Baton Rouge community.” When Woodward was hired in 2019, James Carville, a political pundit who graduated from LSU, taught there and was named to the university’s Manship School of Mass Communications’ Hall of Fame, hosted a welcome party for him at his house in New Orleans. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); In a phone interview with The Associated Press on Thursday night, Carville, a Democrat, expressed disgust at the circumstances surrounding Woodward’s sudden departure. “The Louisiana governor and the LSU board has damaged the reputation of our university,” Carville said. “Landry’s IQ is the equivalent of the temperature of dishwater. “The LSU board is weak and pathetic,” Carville added. “This is not about my politics. It’s about my university.” According to Woodward’s contract, he is owed more than $5 million through 2029. LSU has not yet announced the financial terms of his separation agreement. Landry on Wednesday was hosting a news conference about government matters not concerning LSU when he was asked about the Tigers’ coaching situation and asserted that Woodward would not be involved in the selection of the next coach . Under Woodward, the football program bought out former coach Ed Orgeron for about $17 million in 2021. The buyout for Kelly, whom Woodward signed to a 10-year contract worth about $100 million in December 2021, is about $53 million, which is among the largest in the history of college sports. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Texas A&M’s $77 million buyout of former coach Jimbo Fisher, who was fired in 2023, is the largest. Woodward was Texas A&M’s athletic director when Fisher was hired to coach the Aggies in December 2017. But Woodward already had been at LSU for two years when A&M, in 2021, gave Fisher a contract extension that effectively doubled the cost of his buyout. Still, Landry assigned blame for Fisher’s buyout to Woodward. “This is a pattern,” Landry said. “Right now, we’ve got a $53 million liability. ... We are not doing that again.” Kelly’s firing on Sunday came a day after LSU lost at home to Texas A&M, 49-25 — the Tigers’ third defeat in four games. Kelly went 34-14 at LSU, never reaching the College Football Playoff, which was expanded from four to 12 teams in 2024. LSU does not currently have a president. Its most recent president, William F. Tate IV, left to become president of Rutgers in July. The next president will be hired by the Board of Supervisors, whose members are appointed by the governor to six-year staggered terms. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Since Landry took office in January 2024, he has appointed nine of the 18 board members, and will have the chance to appoint four more in 2026.

origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur? At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn’t settle the controversy. Now a research team said there’s new evidence that resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton — first uncovered in 2006 in Montana — that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex. The discovery “rewrites decades of research on Earth’s most famous predator,” said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Growth rings within the bones found in Montana’s Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully-fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature’s skull and an adult T. rex’s — changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses — were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.

There’s now “more support and evidence than there ever has been” that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she’s not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new. Other independent scientists also said the debate isn’t over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); There are similarities between the shape of T. rex’s skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps. “I don’t think this study settles everything,” he said. Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago — or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed. The new skeleton is dubbed “Dueling Dinosaurs” because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Her public declaration inspired another. Hollywood actor Tim Allen said he was so moved by her words that he was forgiving the drunken driver who caused his father’s death 60 years ago. Barely two weeks after Charlie Kirk’s death, members of a Michigan congregation made public that they too were forgiving a gunman , the one who had just attacked their church, killing four people and injuring eight others. Their high-profile acts of forgiveness are all the more remarkable given the politically charged and highly polarizing climate gripping the U.S. It has pushed people of faith to contemplate what forgiveness means, particularly in the face of violence, trauma and unspeakable grief, and whether it could shift public consciousness toward compassion. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); While some see a glimmer of hope in this moment, others are skeptical.

Thomas Berg, visiting professor at the McGrath Institute for Church Life at the University of Notre Dame, said he hopes Erika Kirk’s gesture “ignites some kind of meaningful national conversation about forgiveness.” He said forgiveness is not a one-time event, but a process that takes time and work. Berg, who counsels victims of sex abuse in the Catholic Church, warns that it should never be coerced but authentically given — an act that he says has the power to heal the deepest wounds. He would like to see more public expressions of forgiveness, which could serve as a balm for the country. “I hope this is not a passing moment,” he said. “The dynamic of forgiveness throws a wrench into the dysfunction of our partisan divides and our inability to have a reasonable exchange of ideas.” Dave Butler, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and science fiction writer based in Utah, believes forgiveness is a mandate for all Christians, as his church teaches. He started a crowdfunding initiative for the family of the Michigan shooter who opened fire on the Latter-day Saints congregation, which as of this week, had raised a little over $388,000. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Butler said he started it because — in addition to the grieving church members who had lost loved ones in this mass shooting — there was the family of the gunman that was also traumatized. “They also did not choose this,” he said. “Nevertheless, they are now short a husband and a father. If we’re not really thoughtful, we might be inclined to see them more as antagonists rather than victims. More than 10,000 people have contributed and they understand what they’re doing is an act of forgiveness.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Forgiveness from the perspective of Anabaptists An often-cited modern example of forgiveness is the response of the Amish community around Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, after a gunman killed five Amish schoolgirls and wounded five more in 2006 before taking his own life. Local Amish immediately expressed forgiveness for the killer and supported his widow. Amish are part of the wider Anabaptist movement, which puts heavy emphasis on Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, containing some of his most radical and counter-cultural sayings — to love enemies, live simply, bless persecutors, turn the other cheek and to endure sufferings joyfully. In it, Jesus says God will only forgive those who forgive others. While many outside the Anabaptists’ world have endorsed their beliefs about forgiveness — which they also voiced for Haitian kidnappers of Anabaptist missionaries in 2021 — others say the picture is more complex. Advocates for victims of sexual abuse in Anabaptist communities say victims and their families are often forced to reconcile with abusers after the latter make a confession and undergo a brief period of discipline. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); A complicated journey for trauma survivors The Jewish perspective on forgiveness is different in that it requires the perpetrator to seek forgiveness from the person who has been wronged, said Rabbi Jeffrey Myers. He heads Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh where 11 people from three congregations were killed after a gunman attacked it during Shabbat services on Oct. 27, 2018. “For me, it’s complicated because there are 11 dead people who cannot be sought for forgiveness,” Myers said, adding that he cannot offer forgiveness because the perpetrator — who faces execution — did not show remorse. “While the perpetrator has received a measure of justice as outlined by the judicial process, it didn’t give me closure because those 11 people are gone,” Myers said. “There is nothing that makes that pain go away.” What gives him some comfort is being able to help other congregations that are going through similar trauma. Myers said he was grateful to have received that support from the Rev. Eric Manning, pastor of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, a historically Black church where a self-proclaimed white supremacist shot and killed nine congregants on June 17, 2015 — including the church’s pastor at the time. “Today, as someone who belongs to that club no one should belong to, I view it as my sacred obligation to help,” Myers said. “Even if I can help one person, that’s gratifying, that feels healing.” Peg Durachko, whose husband Dr. Richard Gottfried, a dentist, was one of the victims in the synagogue shooting, said that as a Catholic, she looked to Pope John Paul II for inspiration as she read about how he visited the imprisoned man who shot him and offered forgiveness. “I recognize (the gunman) as a child of God who made bad choices to lead him in that direction,” she said. “I’m not his judge, God is. I want him to have eternal life. I don’t harbor hate or ill wishes to anyone, including him. I don’t want to carry this baggage of hate.” ___ AP journalist Peter Smith in Pittsburgh contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Here’s what to know. Stay up to date with the latest news from AP. Follow on Trump’s remarks came before meeting with China’s Xi Trump’s comments came in a post on his Truth Social website just before meeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In it, Trump noted other countries testing weapons and wrote: “I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.” The president’s post raised immediate questions. America’s nuclear arsenal is maintained by the Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration, a semiautonomous agency within it — not the Defense Department. The Energy Department has overseen testing of nuclear weapons since its creation in 1977. Two other agencies before it — not the Defense Department — conducted tests. Trump also claimed the U.S. “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country.” Russia is believed to have 5,580 nuclear warheads, according to the Washington-based Arms Control Association, while the U.S. has 5,225. Those figures include so-called “retired” warheads waiting to be dismantled. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute further breaks the warhead total down, with the U.S. having 1,770 deployed warheads with 1,930 in reserve. Russia has 1,718 deployed warheads and 2,591 in reserve. The two countries account for nearly 90% of the world’s atomic warheads. U.S. last carried out a nuclear test in 1992 From the time America conducted its “Trinity” nuclear bomb detonation in 1945 to 1992, the U.S. detonated 1,030 atomic bombs in tests — the most of any country. Those figures do not include the two nuclear weapons America used against Japan in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. The first American tests were atmospheric, but they were then moved underground to limit nuclear fallout. Scientists have come to refer to such tests as “shots.” The last such “shot,” called Divider as part of Operation Julin, took place Sept. 23, 1992, at the Nevada National Security Sites, a sprawling compound some 105 kilometers (65 miles) from Las Vegas. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); America halted its tests for a couple of reasons. The first was the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War. The U.S. also signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty in 1996. There have been tests since the treaty, however — by India, North Korea and Pakistan, the world’s newest nuclear powers. The United Kingdom and France also have nuclear weapons, while Israel long has been suspected of possessing atomic bombs . But broadly speaking, the U.S. also had decades of data from tests, allowing it to use computer modeling and other techniques to determine whether a weapon would successfully detonate. Every president since Barack Obama has backed plans to modernize America’s nuclear arsenal, whose maintenance and upgrading will cost nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The U.S. relies on the so-called “nuclear triad” — ground-based silos, aircraft-carried bombs and nuclear-tipped missiles in submarines at sea — to deter others from launching their weapons against America. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Restarting testing raises additional questions If the U.S. restarted nuclear weapons testing, it isn’t immediately clear what the goal would be. Nonproliferation experts have warned any scientific objective likely would be eclipsed by the backlash to a test — and possibly be a starting gun for other major nuclear powers to begin their own widespread testing. “Restarting the U.S. nuclear testing program could be one of the most consequential policy actions the Trump administration undertakes — a U.S. test could set off an uncontrolled chain of events, with other countries possibly responding with their own nuclear tests, destabilizing global security, and accelerating a new arms race,” experts warned in a February article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “The goal of conducting a fast-tracked nuclear test can only be political, not scientific. ... It would give Russia, China and other nuclear powers free rein to restart their own nuclear testing programs, essentially without political and economic fallout.” Any future U.S. test likely would take place in Nevada at the testing sites, but a lot of work likely would need to go into the sites to prepare them given it’s been over 30 years since the last test. A series of slides made for a presentation at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2018 laid out the challenges, noting that in the 1960s the city of Mercury, Nevada — at the testing grounds — had been the second-largest city in Nevada. On average, 20,000 people had been on site to organize and prepare for the tests. That capacity has waned in the decades since. “One effects shot would require from two to four years to plan and execute,” the presentation reads. “These were massive undertakings.” ___ This story has been corrected to fix transposed numbers for the United States and Russia’s nuclear missile reserves. ___ The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation .

2025-10-27T07:34:31+00:00\n\nTitle: Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?\n\nThe mass-produced COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/jamaica-declares-disaster-after-monstrous-melissa-ravages-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:27:00Z","title":"Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, devastated the Caribbean in October 2025, killing at least 32 people across Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic.

It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nJamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, according to data from the World Resources Institute.\n\nBut like other tropical islands, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a major milestone in its space program.

Jamaica have been urged to take shelter as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-caused-amazons-aws-outage-and-why-did-so-many-major-apps-go-offline","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:23:04+00:00","title":"What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday began at 07:11 GMT when a flawed software update to DynamoDB’s API caused a DNS failure, preventing apps from connecting to essential server addresses.

offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/ngos-note-28-new-carbon-bomb-projects-since-2021","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"12:50:39+00:00","title":"NGOs note 28 new ‘carbon bomb’ projects since 2021","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A report by environmental NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies reveals that 28 new 'carbon bomb' fossil fuel extraction projects have been launched globally between 2021 and 2024.

2021\n\nTwenty-eight new “carbon bomb” projects have launched across the globe over the past five years, according to a report issued by NGOs.\n\nDespite global efforts to phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/death-toll-from-hurricane-melissa-climbs-to-49-with-many-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:15:49+00:00","title":"Death toll from Hurricane Melissa climbs to 49, with many still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, caused widespread destruction across the Caribbean, killing at least 49 people with the death toll expected to rise.

Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/chinas-xi-defends-multilateralism-at-apec-after-striking-deal-with-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:36:22+00:00","title":"China’s Xi takes centre stage at APEC, meets leaders as Trump snubs forum","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, Chinese President Xi Jinping took a leading role in promoting economic globalization and multilateralism, emphasizing supply chain stability and cooperation in green industries.

Jinping has called for efforts to promote economic globalisation and multilateralism at an annual economic regional forum pointedly snubbed by United States President Donald Trump.\n\nXi took centre stage at the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit that began Friday in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, meeting with various leaders, as Trump left the country a day earlier after  reaching deals  meant to ease the escalating trade war with China.\n\n“The more turbulent the times, the more we must work together,” Xi said during the opening session. “The world is undergoing a period of rapid change, with the international situation becoming increasingly complex and volatile.”\n\nThe Chinese leader positioned his country as the defender of free trade systems that observers say are being threatened by  Trump’s tariff hikes  and “America first” policy.\n\nXi called for maintaining supply chain stability, as opposed to US efforts to decouple its supply chains from China, and expressed hopes to work with other countries to expand cooperation in green industries and clean energy.\n\nChinese exports of solar panels, electric vehicles and other green tech have been criticised for creating oversupplies and undercutting the domestic industries of countries it exports to.\n\nThe US president left the country before the summit, after reaching several deals with Xi meant to ease their escalating trade war. Trump described his meeting with Xi on Thursday as a roaring success, saying Beijing had agreed to allow the export of rare earth elements and to start buying US soya beans in exchange for slashing tariffs.\n\nThe US president’s decision to skip APEC, a forum that represents nearly 40 percent of the world’s population and more than half of global goods trade, fits in with his well-known disdain for big, multi-nation forums that have been traditionally used to address huge global problems, with his preference for grand spectacle one-on-one meetings that generate blanket media coverage.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Jack Barton, reporting from Gyeongju, said Xi was “filling the vacuum left by Trump”.\n\nWhile on his first visit to South Korea in 11 years, Xi met Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on the sidelines of the summit on Friday. In brief opening remarks, both leaders said they would seek to advance ties.\n\nAccording to China’s official news agency Xinhua, Xi said he was ready to maintain communication with Takaichi to jointly advance China-Japan ties on the right track.\n\nBarton said the meeting with Japan’s Takaichi would be “setting the diplomatic tone for the foreseeable future”. The Japanese prime minister is described by Chinese media as a far-right nationalist who has visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine.\n\nThe site, dedicated to 2.5 million Japanese who died in wars beginning in the 19th century, is a political lightning rod in East Asia. Among those honoured are World War II leaders convicted as “Class A” war criminals, some of whom committed their atrocities under the Imperial Japan flag in China in the 20th century.\n\n“South Korea and China share some of these historical issues with Japan,” Barton said. “They came out essentially saying, we’re going to put legacy issues on one side and diplomacy on another, so there is scope for a positive outcome.”\n\nXi is scheduled to meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung to discuss denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula on Saturday.\n\nThe Chinese leader also met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday to discuss trade. In the first formal talks between the nations’ leaders since 2017, Carney accepted Xi’s invitation to visit China.\n\nThe Canadian leader pointed to “constructive and pragmatic dialogue” as a route to addressing their “current issues” and cited dialogue as a way “to help build a more sustainable, inclusive international system.”\n\nLeaders and other representatives from 21 Asian and Pacific Rim economies are attending the APEC meeting to discuss how to promote economic cooperation and tackle shared challenges.\n\nThe APEC region faces an array of issues, including strategic competition between the US and China, supply chain vulnerabilities, ageing populations and the effect of AI on jobs.\n\nSouth Korean officials said they have been communicating with other countries to prod all 21 members to adopt a joint statement at the end of the summit, so as not to repeat the failure to issue one in 2018 in Papua New Guinea due to US-China discord over trade.\n\nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said last week that issuing a joint statement strongly endorsing free trade would be unlikely because of differing positions among APEC members.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Barton said the result might be a “watered-down version”.\n\n“The question really is, can APEC survive this age of US-China rivalry?” he added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched its first national HPV vaccination campaign in September 2025, aiming to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14 to prevent cervical cancer, which kills eight women daily.

The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/jamaica-haiti-and-cuba-take-stock-after-hurricane-melissa-destruction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:33:17+00:00","title":"Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, devastated the northern Caribbean, killing at least 34 people across Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba, with the worst damage in Haiti’s Petit-Goave and Jamaica’s western parishes like St Elizabeth and Black River.

new rules that could bar nonprofits deemed to have undertaken work with a “substantial illegal purpose” from a special student loan forgiveness programme.\n\nThose rules, finalised on Thursday, appear to single out certain organisations that do work in areas that President Donald Trump politically opposes, including immigration advocacy and transgender rights.\n\nUnder the new rules, set to take effect in July 2026, the education secretary has the power to exclude groups if they engage in activities like the “chemical castration” of children, using a politically charged term for gender-affirming healthcare, including puberty-delaying medication.\n\nIt also allows the education secretary to bar groups accused of supporting undocumented immigration or “terrorist” organisations.\n\nThe Trump administration has said its decisions “will not be made based on the political views or policy preferences of the organization”.\n\nBut advocates fear the move is the administration’s latest effort to target left-leaning and liberal organisations.\n\nTrump has already  threatened  to crack down on several liberal nonprofits, which the White House has broadly accused of being part of “domestic terror networks”.\n\nThursday’s rules concern the Public Service Loan Forgiveness programme, created by an act of Congress in 2007.\n\nIn an effort to direct more graduates into public service jobs, the programme promises to cancel federal student loans for government employees and many nonprofit workers after they have made 10 years of payments.\n\nWorkers in the public sector, including teachers, medical professionals, firefighters, social service professionals and lawyers, are among those who can benefit.\n\nIn a statement, the Trump administration defended the updated rules, calling them a necessary bulwark to protect taxpayer funds.\n\nThe programme “was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service – not to subsidize organizations that violate the law, whether by harboring illegal immigrants or performing prohibited medical procedures that attempt to transition children away from their biological sex”, said Education Undersecretary Nicholas Kent.\n\nCritics, however, have denounced the administration for using false claims of “terrorism” or criminal behaviour to silence opposing views and restrict civil liberties.\n\nMichael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, said the new rules weaponised loan forgiveness.\n\nLukens explained that many of the lawyers, social workers and paralegals who work at his organisation handle cases to stop deportations and other immigration litigation.\n\nThey count on public service loan forgiveness to take jobs that pay significantly less than the private sector, he said.\n\n“All of a sudden, that’s going away,” Lukens told The Associated Press news agency. “The younger generation, I hope, will be able to wait this out for the next couple of years to see if it gets better, but if it doesn’t, we’re going to see a lot of people leave the field to go and work in a for-profit space.”\n\nOrganisations have raised concerns over the education secretary’s broad power to determine if a group should be barred. Short of a legal finding, the secretary can decide based on a “preponderance of the evidence” whether an employer is in violation.\n\nThe National Council of Nonprofits was among the associations criticising the change.\n\nIt said the rules would allow future administrations from any political party to change eligibility rules “based on their own priorities or ideology”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067258","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/acute-trauma-the-ever-present-wounds-of-gazas-children-from-israels-war","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:12:59+00:00","title":"Acute trauma: The ever-present wounds of Gaza’s children from Israel’s war","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the profound psychological and physical trauma inflicted on children in Gaza due to Israel’s prolonged military campaign, with survivors like 15-year-old Abed al-Aziz and 8-year-old Lana al-Sharif showing severe symptoms including kidney failure, vitiligo, and panic disorders.

Homes, hospitals and schools have been destroyed, while essential medical services have collapsed.\n\nUNICEF Middle East and North Africa Regional Director Edouard Beigbeder said “one million children have endured the daily horrors of surviving in the world’s most dangerous place to be a child, leaving them with wounds of fear, loss and grief.”\n\nSince a ceasefire took effect on October 10, Israeli attacks have  killed dozens of Palestinians  across the enclave. From Tuesday into Wednesday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said Israeli attacks killed 104 people, including 46 children and 20 women.\n\nBeigbeder said the truce “must hold and it must deliver more than calm, it must deliver action … The world cannot allow this ceasefire to fail.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067270","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067201","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067291","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/king-charles-iii-strips-prince-andrew-of-titles-evicts-him-from-royal-home","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"21:54:50+00:00","title":"King Charles III strips Prince Andrew of titles, evicts him from royal home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III has taken an unprecedented step by formally stripping Prince Andrew of all his royal titles, including 'Prince,' 'Duke of York,' and honors such as the Order of the Garter and Royal Victorian Order, in response to allegations of sexual misconduct tied to Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Roberts Giuffre.

Andrew of his remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBuckingham Palace said on Thursday the king “initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew”.\n\nAfter the king’s rare move, Andrew will be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and not as a prince, and he will move from his Royal Lodge residence into “private accommodation”.\n\nIt is almost unprecedented for a British prince or princess to be stripped of that title. It last happened in 1919, when Prince Ernest Augustus, who was a UK royal and also a prince of Hanover, had his British title removed for siding with Germany during World War I.\n\nDemand had been growing on the palace to remove the prince from Royal Lodge after he surrendered his use of the title duke of York earlier this month over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, whose posthumous memoir hit bookstores last week.\n\nBut the king went even further to punish him for  serious lapses of judgement  by removing the title of prince that he had held since birth as a child of a monarch, the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”\n\nGiuffre’s brother declared victory for his sister, who died in April at the age of 41.\n\n“Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage,” her brother Skye Roberts said in a statement.\n\nAndrew faced a new round of public opprobrium after emails emerged earlier this month showing he had remained in contact with Epstein longer than he previously admitted.\n\nThat news was followed by the publication of, Nobody’s Girl, by Giuffre, who alleged she had sex with Andrew when she was 17. The book detailed three alleged sexual encounters with Andrew, who she said acted as if he believed “having sex with me was his birthright”.\n\nAndrew, 65, has long denied Giuffre’s claims, but stepped down from royal duties after a disastrous November 2019 BBC interview in which he attempted to rebut her allegations.\n\nAndrew paid millions in an out-of-court settlement in 2022 after Giuffre filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he did not admit wrongdoing, he acknowledged Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.\n\nThe move by the king means Andrew will no longer be a prince or be known as “his royal highness”, “duke of York”, “earl of Inverness” or “baron Killyleagh” – all titles he held until now. Also gone are honours that include Order of the Garter and status as knight grand cross of the Royal Victorian Order.\n\nAndrew is expected to move to a property on the king’s Sandringham estate near the northeast coast and receive private financial support from his brother."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1345","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:29:52+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,345","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As of October 31, 2025, the Russia-Ukraine war has reached its 1,345th day, marking a significant milestone in a conflict that began on February 24, 2022.

colourful altars, marigold flowers, candles and sugar skulls.\n\nThis is because Mexicans are gearing up to celebrate El Dia de los Muertos – the Day of the Dead – the country’s most important fiesta, which begins this weekend.\n\nMexican families will gather in homes and cemeteries in memory of their family members who have departed. The day is packed with lively parades and rituals such as the decoration of altars, and sumptuous victuals including Mexican street food, a special kind of bread and hot chocolate.\n\nThe Day of the Dead, or El Dia de los Muertos, is not for mourning or grieving, but for celebrating the lives of those who have passed.\n\nIt is believed to be a time when the living and dead can connect with each other. Traditional practices, such as placing marigold flowers on altars and offering certain food items, the aroma and colour of which are thought to help spirits return to visit the living.\n\nTo commemorate the dead, people also dress up in colourful skeleton costumes.\n\nThe festival is rooted in the ancient Aztec belief that death is a continuation of life. Descendants of the Aztec people exist to this day, primarily in Mexico.\n\nThe Aztecs, who were native to central Mexico from the 14th to the 16th century, celebrated the deceased with monthlong festivities.\n\nThey also honoured the goddess of the underworld, Mictecacihuatl, and made offerings of food from the harvest and personal belongings to her during these festivals.\n\nWhen Spanish colonists arrived in Mexico from 1519, they imposed Catholicism on the Aztecs and combined these festivities with Catholic holidays – All Saints’ Day on November 1 and All Souls’ Day on November 2.\n\nEventually, these two days merged into the Day of the Dead.\n\nFamilies create altars called “ofrendas” in their homes and in cemeteries, laden with offerings to deceased loved ones and ancestors.\n\nAltars are created with two levels to symbolise heaven and Earth, three levels to include purgatory, or seven levels to signify the steps to reach heaven.\n\nItems representing the four elements are also placed on the altars: water to quench visitors’ thirst; fire in candles to guide the spirits; earth, represented by food and special items for the deceased; and air, represented by colourful paper designs. Some altars also include salt, which is believed to aid souls on their journey in the afterlife.\n\nThese altars also display pictures of the deceased, items of their favourite food, candles and marigold flowers, which are believed to help lead spirits back from the cemetery to their family’s homes.\n\nThe altars also include tongue-in-cheek poems dedicated to the deceased loved ones called “calaveras” (skulls). These poems describe interesting habits and funny stories which took place during the lives of the now deceased.\n\nSkulls, which represent the cyclical nature of life and death, are a pervasive symbol during the Day of the Dead. Sugar skulls, or “calavera de azucar” are edible and decorative skull models made with sugar, clay or papier-mache, are used to adorn altars.\n\nAnother common food item during the festival is the “bread of the dead” – “pan de muerto” – a circular loaf of bread with bone-shaped designs. The bread is typically sugar-coated, representing the tears of sorrow shed by loved ones.\n\nThe bread is baked and eaten on both days of the festival, and is also offered at the altars.\n\nWebsites such as MiAltar also allow users to create virtual altars. These can be shared on the website.\n\nLa Catrina is a tall, female skeletal figure, and she is seen everywhere during the festival.\n\nShe was a character created in the early 1900s by political cartoonist and lithographer Jose Guadalupe Posada.\n\nLa Catrina dons a fancy French hat and feathers. Posada’s work was a commentary on the aspirations of Mexicans to emulate the European elite.\n\nPosada was known for saying “we are all skeletons”, alluding to how, under the luxurious clothing, jewellery and coverings, we are all the same.\n\nIn 1947, artist Diego Rivera included Posada’s art in a mural, naming her Catrina, which means “the rich”.\n\nThe main days of celebration are November 1 and November 2. However, some parts of the world begin celebrations on October 27, when people also commemorate their dead pets. The days following this are dedicated to building altars.\n\nWhile the Day of the Dead is a Mexican festival, it is also celebrated across Latin America, in Spain, some parts of the United States with large Mexican-American populations, and the Philippines, which was colonised by Spain in 1565.\n\nNovember 1 is typically dedicated to children who have passed, referred to as “angelitos” (little angels). Their graves are decorated with toys and balloons.\n\nThe day after, also still called All Souls Day, is for adults who have departed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/31/live-israel-bombs-south-gaza-as-palestinians-live-ceasefire-without-peace?update=4073076","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:01:18+00:00","title":"Ceasefire without peace in Gaza as Israel continues bombing enclave","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A ceasefire has been established in Gaza, but peace remains elusive as Israel continues bombing the enclave.

The US, China, and Iran all signed but have not ratified the original treaty, while Russia withdrew its ratification in 2023.\n\nMoscow carried out its last nuclear test in 1990 while still the Soviet Union, and China carried out its last nuclear test in 1996, according to the UN. The last nuclear test by the United Kingdom was in 1991, followed by the US in 1992 and France in 1996. North Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear tests in the past two decades, with its last test in 2017.\n\nTrevor Findlay, a nuclear security expert and honorary professional fellow at the University of Melbourne, told Al Jazeera that it was unclear what type of testing Trump was referring to in his post.\n\n“My assumption is that he means missile launches of nuclear-capable missiles, as North Korea and Russia have been doing very publicly. These do not carry an actual nuclear warhead [but likely a dummy], nor do they create a nuclear explosion,” he said.\n\n“The US already tests its own missiles periodically, both existing ones and ones in development, often splashing down in the Pacific. It does announce them but tends not to make a big deal of it, like North Korea and Russia,” he said.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has called for the “total dismantlement” of Iran’s nuclear programme and says he does not want Tehran to obtain a nuclear weapon.

They’ve constantly been saying they are not intending to make a nuclear bomb,” Panda told Al Jazeera. “The only thing that Iran has which might be taken seriously is some highly enriched uranium.

for Senate to scrap filibuster tactic to end the gov’t shutdown\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has called on the Senate to vote to scrap the filibuster custom so that Republicans can end a  weeks-long  federal government shutdown.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday, the US leader chastised “Crazed Lunatics” in the Democratic Party.\n\n“It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote.\n\n“WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing [end the filibuster], it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN’,” he added.\n\nThe filibuster is a longstanding Senate tactic that delays or blocks votes on legislation by keeping debate open. The Senate requires a supermajority – 60 of the chamber’s 100 members – to overcome a filibuster and pass most legislation.\n\nSenate rules, including the filibuster, can be changed by a simple majority vote at any time. Republicans currently hold a 53-47 Senate majority.\n\nSince October 1, when the new fiscal year began, Senate Democrats have voted against advancing a government bill extending funding to federal agencies.\n\nDemocrats have demanded that Republicans reverse planned sweeping cuts to Medicaid, which extends healthcare coverage to tens of millions of low-income Americans, and prevent health insurance premiums from going up.\n\nThe deadlock entered its 31st day on Friday. It is set to become the longest deadlock in history if it surpasses the 35-day lapse that took place in 2019 under the first Trump administration.\n\nFederal employees categorised as “essential” continue to work without pay during government shutdowns until they can be reimbursed when it ends.\n\nMost recently, on Tuesday, US air traffic controllers were told they would  not receive their paychecks this month , raising concerns that mounting financial stress could take a toll on the already understaffed employees who guide thousands of flights each day.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that the federal government shutdown could cost the US economy between $7bn and $14bn.\n\nTrump has just returned to the US from his Asia tour, in which he visited Qatar, Malaysia, Japan and South Korea – where he  held a major summit  with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, the US leader said that while the trip was a success, conversations had caused him to consider the filibuster issue.\n\n“The one question that kept coming up, however, was how did the Democrats SHUT DOWN the United States of America, and why did the powerful Republicans allow them to do it? The fact is, in flying back, I thought a great deal about that question, WHY?” he wrote.\n\nThe US leader continued that he believed that should the Democrats come back into power, they would “exercise their rights” and end the filibuster on the “first day they take office”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/radio-free-asia-says-halting-news-operations-due-to-trump-admin-cuts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"03:11:00+00:00","title":"Radio Free Asia says halting news operations due to Trump admin cuts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Radio Free Asia (RFA) has announced the shutdown of its news operations due to severe financial difficulties caused by the Trump administration’s elimination of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) in March 2025.

news operations due to Trump admin cuts\n\nRadio Free Asia (RFA) will shut down its news operations on Friday, citing the government-funded news outlet’s dire financial situation caused by funding cuts under President Donald Trump’s administration and the ongoing US government shutdown.\n\nBay Fang, RFA’s president and CEO, said in a statement that “uncertainty about our budgetary future” means that the outlet has been “forced to suspend all remaining news content production”.\n\n“In an effort to conserve limited resources on hand and preserve the possibility of restarting operations should consistent funding become available, RFA is taking further steps to responsibly shrink its already reduced footprint,” she said on Wednesday.\n\nFang added that RFA would begin closing its overseas bureaus and would formally lay off and pay severance to furloughed staff. She said many staff members have been on unpaid leave since March, “when the US Agency for Global Media [USAGM] unlawfully terminated RFA’s Congressionally appropriated grant”.\n\nOn March 14, Trump signed an executive order effectively eliminating USAGM, an independent US government agency created in the mid-1990s to broadcast news and information to regions with poor press freedom records.\n\nAlongside RFA, USAGM also hosts sister publications Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE) and Voice of America (VOA).\n\nFollowing March’s executive order, RFA was forced to put three-quarters of its US-based employees on unpaid leave and terminate most of its overseas contractors.\n\nAnother round of mass layoffs followed in May, along with the termination of several RFA language services, including Tibetan, Burmese and Uighur.\n\nMass layoffs also took place at VOA in March when Trump  signed another executive order  placing nearly all 1,400 staff at the outlet – which he described as a “total left-wing disaster” – on paid leave. It has operated on a limited basis since then.\n\nTrump has said operations like RFA, RFE/Radio Liberty and VOA are a waste of government resources and accused them of being biased against his administration.\n\nSince its founding in 1996, RFA has reported on Asia’s most repressive regimes, providing English- and local-language online and broadcast services to citizens of authoritarian governments across the region.\n\nIts flagship projects include its Uighur service – the world’s only independent Uyghur-language outlet, covering the repressed ethnic group in western China – as well as its North Korea service, which reports on events inside the hermit state.\n\nAn announcement penned by RFA executive editor Rosa Hwang, published on the outlet’s website on Wednesday, said, “Make no mistake, authoritarian regimes are already celebrating RFA’s potential demise.”\n\n“Independent journalism is at the core of RFA. For the first time since RFA’s inception almost 30 years ago, that voice is at risk,” Hwang said.\n\n“We still believe in the urgency of that mission – and in the resilience of our extraordinary journalists. Once our funding returns, so will we,” she added.\n\nRFE/Radio Liberty, which went through its own round of furloughs earlier this year, said this week that it received its last round of federal funding in September and its news services are continuing for now.\n\n“We plan to continue reaching our audiences for the foreseeable future,” it said.\n\nIt’s not immediately clear why RFA and RFE/Radio Liberty – which share the same governing and funding structure, but are based in the US and Europe, respectively – are taking different approaches."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/31/live-israel-bombs-south-gaza-as-palestinians-live-ceasefire-without-peace","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:01:18+00:00","title":"Ceasefire without peace in Gaza as Israel continues bombing enclave","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a declared ceasefire in Gaza, the conflict remains unresolved as Israel continues bombing the region.

2025-10-31T09:09:37+00:00\n\nTitle: The New York City mayoral race – in five maps and charts\n\nIt’s a dramatic race to the finish line between traditional politics and a new-age, people-powered-social-media-powered campaign, as New York City prepares to vote for its next mayor.\n\nNew Yorkers will head to the polls on November 4 as a three-way mayoral race, between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, former Democratic governor and now independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, draws global attention.\n\nNew York City holds mayoral elections every four years, with a two-term limit for any individual. But this year’s contest is notable for its three-way dynamic, bringing progressive, establishment and conservative forces to  face off  in the country’s largest city.\n\nHere are five maps and charts to help you understand New York City and how the vote works.\n\nNew York City is the most populous city in the United States, with a population of nearly  8.5 million people as of July 2024.\n\nIt is also the most densely populated city in the country, with about 11,314 residents per square kilometre (29,303 residents per square mile).\n\nThe East Coast city comprises five boroughs, which are administrative divisions equivalent to counties.\n\nThey include:\n\nThe Bronx: The  birthplace of hip-hop  and home to Yankee Stadium. It is also home to 1.35 million people across 110sq km (42sq miles). The annual median income is $28,664, while renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,100 on average per month, making that about $25,200 annually.\n\nBrooklyn: Known for its arts scene, quirky, diverse neighbourhoods, and the Brooklyn Bridge. It is home to 2.56 million people across 180sq km (71sq miles). Brooklyn has the third-highest annual median income of the five boroughs at $41,171, and a one-bedroom apartment averages $2,800 per month, which makes $33,600 annually.\n\nManhattan: The economic and cultural centre of the city, home to Wall Street, Broadway, and Central Park, it’s a main character in many US television shows and movies. It is home to 1.59 million people across 59sq km (23sq miles). Manhattan has the highest annual median income of $61,439 but also has the highest rental rates, averaging $4,200 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, which is $50,400 per year.\n\nQueens: The largest of the boroughs and home to two major airports – JFK International and LaGuardia. It is also home to 2.56 million people across 280sq km (109 sq miles). The annual median income is $40,549 and renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,700 per month on average, almost $32,400 annually.\n\nStaten Island: Accessible by ferry from Lower Manhattan, this historic suburban borough, known for its parks and historical sites, is home to nearly 500,000 people across 152sq km (59sq miles). The annual median income is the second highest at $47,218, and renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,000 per month on average, which is $24,000 per year.\n\nTogether, the five boroughs cover a surface area of about 778.2 square kilometres (300 square miles) which is about the same size as Memphis in Tennessee, Berlin in Germany, or Singapore.\n\nAt 38.8 years, New York City’s median age is slightly lower than the national median age of 39.2, reflecting its younger, more urban population.\n\nThe largest age group in New York City is that of 30-34 year olds (8.49 percent), followed by 25-29 year olds (8.02 percent), and 35-39 year olds (7.26 percent). Together, they make up nearly a quarter of the city’s total population.\n\nNew York City has slightly more females (4.29 million) than males (3.96 million).\n\nNew York City is widely regarded as one of the most diverse cities in the world, with residents speaking more than  200  languages.\n\nAccording to City of New York data, 37 percent of New Yorkers were born outside the United States, and as many as 49 percent speak a language other than English at home.\n\nAdditionally, almost half of the city’s businesses are owned by immigrants.\n\nAt the time of the 2020 census, 30.9 percent of New Yorkers were white, followed by Hispanics at 28.3 percent, Blacks at 20.2 percent, and Asians at 15.6 percent. Residents identifying as two or more races, or other groups, including Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Hawaiians, make up the remaining five percent of the city.\n\nThe different boroughs, however, do not replicate citywide numbers, which vary greatly, and according to the 2020 census, are as follows:\n\nBrooklyn population: 2.73 million\n\nQueens population: 2.4 million\n\nManhattan population: 1.69 million\n\nThe Bronx population: 1.47 million\n\nStaten Island population: 495,747\n\nNew York City is one of  27 US cities  holding mayoral elections on November 4.\n\nThe current mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, who has been in office since January 2022,  withdrew his candidacy  earlier in the year following several controversies, most notably his federal criminal indictment on bribery and conspiracy charges, which was ultimately dismissed by a judge in April.\n\nThe last non-Democratic mayor of New York City was Republican Rudy Giuliani, who was elected in 1993 and served two terms until 2001. Since then, the city has consistently chosen Democratic mayors, including Michael Bloomberg (2002-2023), Bill de Blasio (2014-2021) and Eric Adams.\n\nFollowing primary elections within the two major parties, the three leading contenders for mayor are now: Zohran Mamdani, 34; Andrew Cuomo, 67; and Curtis Sliwa, 71.\n\nMamdani is the Democratic Party candidate and also endorsed by the progressive Working Families Party.\n\nAn immigrant, Muslim and Democratic Socialist, Mamdani’s campaign has been focused on making New York more affordable, with rent freezes, free universal childcare and lower public transport costs.\n\nMamdani has been serving as a member of the State Assembly since 2021. His popularity has risen hugely over the past year, as the mayoral campaigns have got under way and, now, as early voting has begun. Nearly 220,000 ballots have already been cast.\n\nThe millennial candidate has appealed greatly to younger voters. On Sunday, he addressed a crowd of 13,500 people at the Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, with a promise that “New York isn’t for sale” – meaning it should be owned by the people generally, not by corporations and the “billionaire class”. Mamdani was joined by long-term Democratic Socialist senator, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, New York congresswoman who won congressional elections in 2018 with record numbers.\n\nThe independent candidate was New York’s Democratic Governor from 2011-2021, and served as the attorney general of New York from 2007-2010, US secretary of housing and urban development from 1997-2001, and assistant secretary of housing and urban development from 1993-1997.\n\nThe government stalwart has decades of federal and state-level political experience, but in his last term as New York governor, he was accused by 13 women of sexual harassment and was forced to step down from office.\n\nAn independent investigation by the Office of the New York State Attorney General concluded that Cuomo had sexually harassed multiple women. This included unwanted touching, kissing and hugging, inappropriate comments, and retaliation against at least one complainant.\n\nInitially, Cuomo ran as a Democratic candidate for mayor, but lost in the primaries to Mamdani. Cuomo received 43.61 percent of the votes, and Mamdani 56.39 percent.\n\nCuomo’s political experience may resonate with older voters but, according to all the major polls, Mamdani is at least 10 points ahead of him.\n\nIn April, the New York City Campaign Finance Board (CFB), the campaign finance regulator, found Cuomo’s campaign had not provided evidence of digital donations, a requirement to qualify for public funds.\n\nCuomo’s campaign lost out on nearly $3 million in public funds as a result of this.\n\nThen, in May, the CFB fined his campaign $675,000 for “improper coordination” with a  supporting Super PAC .\n\nCuomo has been supported by billionaires William P Lauder, Barry Diller, Michael Kors and Michael Bloomberg.\n\nSince early voting began on October 25, almost 300,000 ballots have already been submitted. So far, Mamdani has maintained a 10-point lead over Cuomo, according to the Quinnipiac University Poll. The RealClearPolitics average has Mamdani leading at 46 percent, followed by Cuomo at 30.5 percent, and Sliwa trailing at 16.6 percent.\n\nUnlike in the primaries, in which voters rank their choices, New York City voters will mark just one choice for mayor. Candidates are listed by party on the ballot paper, so some appear more than once if they have been endorsed by more than one.\n\nAs of February, there were  5.1 million registered voters in New York City , of whom 65 percent were Democrats and 11 percent were Republicans. About 1.1 million voters were not registered with any party and voter registration closed on  October 25 , one week before the November 4 election.\n\nIn the last New York City mayoral election, just more than 1.1 million voters cast ballots – about 21 percent of registered voters.\n\nTo be eligible to vote, residents of New York must:\n\nPolling stations will be open between the hours of 6am (10:00 GMT) and 9pm (01:00 GMT on November 5) on November 4.\n\nTimings vary from location to location in the city, but polling stations open between 8am and 10am and close between 4pm and 9pm.\n\nEarly voting began on October 25 and will end on November 2.\n\nA full list of polling stations open for early voting is available on the Board of Elections in the City of New York  website .\n\nNew Yorkers will also cast votes for the positions of public advocate and comptroller in citywide elections. Many districts will also choose a new borough president, City Council seats, judges and other local offices.\n\nIn addition to that, voters must vote in favour of or against the following proposals on the ballot:"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620lk0gm0vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"02:32:32.975+00:00","title":"Japan plans to hire hunters as bear attacks rise","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan is facing a dangerous rise in bear attacks, with 12 deaths and over 100 injuries reported this year — the highest since tracking began in the 2000s.

rise in bear attacks.\n\nThe environment ministry said on Thursday that it would set aside funds to hire licenced hunters and other personnel to tackle bears that have been wandering into residential areas and attacking people.\n\nThe move is among measures proposed on Thursday, after the country held a high-level meeting to address the country's growing bear problem.\n\nTwelve people have died in bear attacks this year - the highest the country has recorded since it started tracking cases in the 2000s.\n\nThey include a man who had been delivering newspapers in Hokkaido and a 67-year-old man

Witcher season 4: Can new cast escape shadow of Henry Cavill?\n\nThe latest season of Netflix's The Witcher has landed - with one big difference.\n\nFormer lead actor Henry Cavill has been replaced as main character Geralt of Rivia by Liam Hemsworth.\n\nThe Australian has stepped in for the final two seasons of the fantasy show, based on a popular series of novels and video games.\n\nPreviously, British actor Cavill had portrayed the title character, a monster hunter with supernatural abilities known as the White Wolf.\n\nWhen he announced he was \"passing the torch\" to Hemsworth in October 2022, describing him as a \"fantastic\" actor, not all fans agreed.\n\nSome even threatened to boycott the series without, and Hemsworth has admitted Cavill is a \"daunting\" act to follow.\n\nEarly reviews have been mixed, with US magazine Variety calling season four an \" upgrade \", while the Guardian says Hemsworth is \" as charismatic as a bollard in a wig \".\n\nBBC Newsbeat caught up with professional reviewers to get their thoughts on the latest episodes - and whether the new Geralt is up to the job.\n\nHenry Cavill's love of nerd culture is well-known, and he's been vocal about his love of video games, sci-fi and fantasy.\n\nThere's been no official explanation for his departure from The Witcher, but it's been suggested creative differences played a part.\n\nHe's spoken in interviews about being \"loyal to the source material\" and the importance of keeping Geralt the same as the character in the books.\n\nSince leaving, he's landed a role as a producer and star of Amazon's upcoming  Warhammer 40,000 series  - something he's described as a dream role.\n\nSabrina Barr, TV Editor at Metro, says Henry Cavill was the \"epitome of Geralt\", and admits seeing Hemsworth in the role was \"jarring\" at first.\n\nBut she tells Newsbeat he he does a \"good job\" and is \"brave\" for taking on the character.\n\nIn her  three-and-a-half star review , Sabrina says apprehensive Witcher fans should \"give it a chance\".\n\n\"I've got to give them credit for taking a really difficult situation and deciding to run with their creative vision,\" she says.\n\n\"In my opinion, this season isn't the best of them but I still had a really good time with it. I was gripped by the very different story lines.\"\n\nSabrina tells Newsbeat it's \"extremely rare\" to change the main actor in between seasons but this, in her opinion, is an example of \"how it can work\" if there's no other choice.\n\n\"I personally would have been a lot more upset if they just cancelled the show,\" she says.\n\n\"I have to give them credit for carrying on the story, knowing full well that from the very start there would be people criticising the choice of main actor no matter who it was.\"\n\nDawson Roberts, a content creator who focuses on TV, film and gaming as DawsOnScreen, was invited to the premiere of the new season.\n\nHe agrees the actor swap is \"definitely a bit weird\" but tells Newsbeat the transition is handled well by the show's cast and crew.\n\nIn his view, Liam Hemsworth does a \"pretty good\" job in the main role.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie and say he's better than Henry Cavill,\" says Dawson.\n\n\"But I do think Liam Hemsworth does a really solid job. You get used to it really quickly. He's got the right energy.\n\n\"Losing Henry Cavill is tough but I do think they have built that trust with the audience so now it does work.\"\n\nDawson says the unsung hero of the series is actor Laurence Fishburne, who joins the cast as vampire Regis.\n\n\"People aren't giving enough credit to Laurence Fishburne,\" he says.\n\n\"He's never done a fantasy role before and I think he kills it.\"\n\nAs for Dawson's verdict, he says he's closer to \"the seven or eight out of 10 than the two-star reviews\".\n\n\"It's definitely not the best show ever,\" he says.\n\n\"But it's still really exciting to see the game world brought to life on the screen - even if it is without Henry Cavill.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat  live  at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back  here ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgk40l8jm7o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:45:01.033+00:00","title":"Reeves rebuked by PM over 'regrettable' rental confusion but faces no further action","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chancellor Rachel Reeves faced criticism from the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, over failing to secure a required selective licence for her family home in Southwark, a London borough where private landlords must obtain a £945 licence.

further action over the failure to obtain the correct licence when renting out her family home.\n\nHowever, Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"regrettable\" Reeves did not share all the relevant emails when she first told him about the issue on Wednesday evening.\n\nThe chancellor initially said she was not aware a licence was needed but later found correspondence between her husband and the letting

has apologised for the \"inadvertent mistake\" but said she accepted full responsibility.\n\nConservative Party chairman Kevin Hollinrake called for a full investigation, saying the chancellor's story \"keeps on changing\".\n\n\"On Wednesday, the independent adviser on ministerial standards said he was simply willing to take Rachel Reeves' word and the case was closed,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\n\"The next day some more evidence came to light, which meant Rachel Reeves's story on Wednesday was a false narrative of the event.\"\n\nReeves put her four-bedroom south London home up for rent in July 2024, when Labour won the general election and she moved into 11 Downing Street.\n\nThe house falls in an area where Southwark Council requires private landlords to obtain a selective licence at a cost of £945. Reeves or her letting agent could face an unlimited fine if the council takes the matter to court.\n\nSouthwark Council has refused to comment on Reeves's case but said it only takes enforcement action against landlords who do not apply for a licence within 21 days of receiving a warning or where a property is found to be in an unsafe condition.\n\nReeves says she has now applied for a licence.\n\nThe chancellor said she first became aware that her property did not have the correct licence on Wednesday when the Daily Mail, who first reported the story, contacted her.\n\nAfter consulting his ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus, who decided against launching an investigation, Sir Keir accepted Reeves's apology and said he was happy the \"matter can be drawn to a close\".\n\nHowever, the release of the emails between her husband and the letting agent on Thursday reopened the row.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, Sir Laurie said he still believed Reeves made an \"an unfortunate but inadvertent error\".\n\nWhile he did not rule on whether the ministerial code had been broken, he said he found \"no evidence of bad faith\".\n\nIn a letter to Reeves on Thursday evening, Sir Keir said he agreed with his ethics adviser and saw \"no need for any further action\".\n\nHe accepted the emails from the estate agent were only found by her husband on Thursday morning and Reeves was \"acting in good faith\".\n\nHowever, he added: \"It would clearly have been better if you and your husband had conducted a full trawl through all email correspondence with the estate agency before writing to me yesterday.\"\n\nDefending his colleague, Trade Minister Chris Bryant said he did not think the fault lay with Reeves and she would be \"entitled to feel a bit grumpy\" about the situation.\n\n\"She realised that her husband had actually had some emails, some correspondence with the estate agent - and the estate agent had said categorically in terms we will sort out this licence for you and then subsequently it didn't happen,\" he told the BBC.\n\nThe revelations come at a politically awkward time for Reeves, who is preparing for a Budget at the end of the month amidst speculation the government is planning to break a manifesto commitment not to raise income tax.\n\nIn a statement, Gareth Martin, owner of Harvey & Wheeler, the estate agent which rented out the property on behalf of Reeves, said: \"In an effort to be helpful our previous property manager offered to apply for a licence on these clients' behalf, as shown in the correspondence. That property manager suddenly resigned on the Friday before the tenancy began on the following Monday.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the lack of application was not picked up by us as we do not normally apply for licences on behalf of our clients; the onus is on them to apply. We have apologised to the owners for this oversight.\n\n\"At the time the tenancy began, all the relevant certificates were in place and if the licence had been applied for, we have no doubt it would have been granted.\n\n\"Our clients would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c364j8r7xjgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:29:58.592+00:00","title":"Manipur: Displaced families fear the looming resettlement deadline","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Manipur, India, thousands of people displaced by violent ethnic clashes between the Meitei and Kuki communities in May 2023 now face an uncertain future as the government plans to shut down all temporary relief camps by December 2025.

two years ago now face an uncertain future, as the government plans to shut down all temporary relief camps by December.\n\nThe violence, which erupted in May 2023 between the majority Meitei and the indigenous Kuki communities, was the worst the region had witnessed in decades.\n\nIt started after protests by the largely Christian Kuki community against the Meiteis, mostly Hindus, who were demanding official tribal status that would grant them access to the same government benefits and job quotas as other tribes, including Kukis.\n\nAt least 260 people were killed in the clashes and around 60,000 displaced people have since been living in temporary shelters.\n\nOver the past two years, the government has made repeated promises to rehabilitate the displaced, but little has changed on the ground. Many say their lives remain in a limbo - effectively homeless and without a steady source of income.\n\nAnxieties grew further in July when the state's then Chief Secretary Prashant Singh announced that all relief camps would be shut down by December and its residents would be resettled.\n\nHe added that those unable to return to their homes would be relocated to pre-fabricated housing units.\n\nThe government, however, did not clarify where these units would be - whether near the relief camps or near displaced people's original homes  - worsening their concerns about future.\n\nUncertainty grew in September when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his first visit to Manipur since the violence began, announced that 7,000 new homes would be built to resettle the displaced in \"appropriate locations\" without giving any other details.\n\nOn the ground, Manipur remains sharply divided: the Meiteis inhabit the Imphal Valley, while the Kukis live in the surrounding hill districts; and security forces continue to patrol the buffer zones that separate the two communities.\n\nA security official deployed in the area told BBC Hindi that his mandate was to \"ensure that Meiteis and Kukis remain in their respective areas and do not mix\".\n\nExperts say resettling people in their original neighbourhoods is crucial to prevent the violence from redrawing Manipur's social map.\n\n\"This is not good for a secular, democratic India. Resettling them in their original homes is most critical,\" said RK Nimai Singh, former secretary to the Manipur governor.\n\nHe added that many displaced people feared that if they left the relief camps and moved into temporary housing, they might never be able to return to their homes.\n\nIt's a thought that haunts Hatnu Haokip. For her, home means only one place - Imphal valley - and she yearns to go back.\n\n\"But that can't happen because our village is now surrounded by Meitei people,\" said the 22-year-old who is now living in a relief camp in the hilly Churachandpur region\n\nMs Haokip added that she would feel safer if Kuki leaders were given autonomy to set up a  separate federally-administered territory for the community.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by several other Kukis, who also feel apprehensive of returning to their homes.\n\nOn the other hand, most Meiteis BBC Hindi spoke to said they wanted to go back home.\n\nIrom Abung, who once ran a water supply business in Churachandpur, now lives in a relief camp near a buffer zone.\n\nHis house was damaged during the violence, but Mr Abung says he will never give up on the place he once called home.\n\n\"My land remains. I will never sell it because I know I will return one day,\" he said. \"Efforts must be made to bridge the gap between our two communities so people can go back to their lives.\"\n\nThe unease, coupled with uncertainty over where the new homes will be built, has raised doubts over whether the government would be able to close all relief camps by December.\n\nGovernment officials, however, insist that the resettlement plan is on track.\n\n\"From about 290 camps initially, we've brought the number down to around 260,\" a senior Manipur government official said.\n\n\"Eventually, we want to resettle people in the areas from where they fled, once they feel safe to return.\"\n\nThe official added that while they understood people's concerns, it was also in the state's interest for them to return home - otherwise, the divisions would only grow deeper.\n\nAs tens of thousands of people continue to live in relief camps, many complain about not getting the facilities the government promised them.\n\nNemhoichong Lhungdim, a single mother, said her 11-year-old son had suffered a debilitating eye injury a few months back and has lost sight in one eye.\n\nAfter government doctors failed to help, she borrowed money to take him to a private hospital, but was unable to afford the treatment.\n\n\"I was told it would cost about 300,000 rupees ($3,400; £2,600). I don't have that kind of money,\" she said.\n\nMs Lhungdim says the government sometimes organises health camps, but they have never treated her son. BBC Hindi has reached out to officials for a response.\n\nInside the camps, residents say prolonged displacement and uncertainty are also taking a toll on people's mental health.\n\nSalam Monika, 25, says her uncle took his own life last year after being driven to despair by a lack of livelihood opportunities. She says the family could not access medical help.\n\n\"Some mental health workers visited our camp a few times since 2023, but this year, they haven't come at all,\" she said.\n\nBBC Hindi has reached out to the government for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, those moved from camps into temporary housing say that while they now have a roof over their heads, they still struggle to make ends meet as livelihood remains a concern.\n\nChingakham Radha, one of the newly resettled residents, said she learned to make crochet dolls while living in the camp and now earns a small income from selling them. \"The money is very little, just enough to get by,\" she said.\n\nBefore the conflict, Ms Radha was a homemaker and her husband worked as a labourer. They were not wealthy, but had a happy life.\n\nThinking about those days, Ms Radha says life has become uncertain now.\n\n\"Some days my husband finds work, but other times weeks go by without any work,\" she said. \"I want to return home to Churachandpur, but those hopes are fading with time.\"\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn40w7g2d2zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"08:00:12.577+00:00","title":"Russia's new nuclear weapons - do they work or is it Putin bluster?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia has announced new nuclear weapons tests involving the Poseidon underwater drone and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, claiming these are unprecedented and highly advanced.

2025-10-31T08:00:12.577+00:00\n\nTitle: Russia's new nuclear weapons - do they work or is it Putin bluster?\n\nOn Wednesday, over tea and cakes with veterans of the Ukraine war, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia had tested a new weapon.\n\n\"There is nothing like this,\" the Russian leader said of the Poseidon - a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable underwater drone that can be fired like a torpedo and which a senior Russian MP said could \"put entire states out of operation\".\n\nWhen it was first unveiled in 2018, Russian media said the Poseidon would be able to achieve a speed of 200km/h (120mph) and travel in a \"constantly changing route\" that would make it impossible to intercept.\n\nPutin's claim came only days after the announcement that Moscow had conducted a test of its \"unlimited-range\" Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile.\n\nIt's \"a unique product, unmatched in the world\", Putin said of the Burevestnik, noting the missile was so new \"we are yet to identify what it is, what class of weapons [it] belongs to\".\n\nIt is not unusual for Russia to test and flaunt weapons.\n\nAnd, despite the boisterous nature of Russian announcements, their military value is ambiguous.\n\n\"They are basically Armageddon weapons - too powerful to be used unless you're happy to destroy the world,\" Mark Galeotti, a Russia scholar and long-time observer of Russian politics, told the BBC.\n\nBoth the Poseidon and the Burevestnik are second-strike, retaliatory weapons, Mr Galeotti added - and not even the most rabid Kremlin propagandists are suggesting anyone is preparing to launch strikes on Russia.\n\nIt is also unclear whether the weapons are actually viable.\n\nIn 2019,  five Russian nuclear engineers died in a rocket engine explosion  which some Russian and Western experts said was linked to the Burevestnik.\n\nTwo years later, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) - a London-based think tank specialising in global conflict and security - noted that Russia faced \"considerable technical challenges\" in ensuring \"the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit\" of the missile.\n\nNeither the Poseidon nor the Burevestnik were entirely novel - both  had first been presented to the world in 2018  as part of a new array of weapons that Putin called \"invincible\".\n\nSo it is the timing of the announcements - rather than their contents - which could be noteworthy.\n\nAfter a whirlwind few months of tentative diplomacy by US President Donald Trump to try and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Trump appears to have cooled off on the endeavour to end the war.\n\nLast week, the White House cancelled a summit between Trump and Putin, apparently after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio realised the gulf between Moscow and Washington's positions was too great for a high-level meeting to achieve meaningful results.\n\nNot only is there no suggestion of any further talks, but soon after the meeting was cancelled, Trump imposed sanctions on two of Russia's biggest oil producers as punishment for Moscow's failure to agree on a peace deal in Ukraine.\n\nAnd while his relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seems to still be fraught, it appears Trump is growing irritated with Moscow's intractability.\n\nSo Putin may be vying for Trump's attention.\n\n\"In the face of Trump blowing hot and cold with his support for Ukraine or sympathy to Russia, here is an element in which Moscow has bigger cards than Kyiv,\" Mr Galeotti argued.\n\n\"So in that context [successful weapons tests] are more about keeping him thinking Russia is indeed powerful.\"\n\nAnother clue could come from the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nThree-and-a-half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour, its troops continue to merely grind on - at great cost in human life and resources - with no obvious breakthrough likely any time soon.\n\n\"We are getting towards the end of summer fighting season in Ukraine and it has not gone very well for the Russians,\" said David Heathcote, head of intelligence at McKenzie Intelligence Services.\n\nThe announcements about the Burevestnik and the Poseidon should be seen as a reflection of the weakness of their conventional forces, Mr Heathcote told the BBC.\n\nRussia is not formally part of any military alliances that would serve as a deterrent if it is on the back foot, and its army is tied up and under pressure in Ukraine.\n\nIn these cases, Mr Heathcote says, \"the Russians always react with unnecessary and overexaggerated sabre rattling\".\n\nWhile Moscow's decision to publicly announce the Burevestnik and Poseidon tests may have been influenced by this, it seems the claim has already had the tangible effect of provoking Trump into instructing its military to resume nuclear weapons testing.\n\nTrump justified the move as a way of keeping pace with other countries such as Russia and China.\n\n\"With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" Trump said - although it will likely take several months for the US to restart nuclear tests after a 33-year pause.\n\nThe Kremlin's reaction to Trump's statement was quick\n\nPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov questioned whether the US president had been correctly informed. The Russian tests \"cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test\", Peskov said.\n\nTrump did not elaborate on the kind of tests he wanted the US to resume.\n\nIt was likely, said Christopher Egerton of the Institute for Strategic Studies (IIS), that Trump's decision was a direct response to the Russian test of the Burevestnik and that the US could be planning to conduct similar flight tests of US Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr4qqgdlkjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"22:01:43.279+00:00","title":"Sudan war: Survivors of el-Fasher siege tell the BBC about RSF brutality","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the aftermath of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seizing control of el-Fasher in Sudan’s Darfur region, thousands of civilians have fled to nearby towns like Tawila, where they face extreme trauma, malnutrition, and physical injuries.

war: Survivors of el-Fasher siege tell the BBC about RSF brutality\n\nShaken, scratched and left with just the clothes he is wearing, Ezzeldin Hassan Musa describes the brutality of Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the wake of the paramilitary group taking control of el-Fasher city in the Darfur region.\n\nHe says its fighters tortured and murdered men trying to flee.\n\nNow in the town of Tawila, lying exhausted on a mat under a gazebo, Ezzeldin is one of several thousand people who have made it to relative safety after escaping what the UN has described as \"horrific\" violence.\n\nOn Wednesday, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted to \"violations\" in el-Fasher and said they would be investigated. A day later a senior UN official said the RSF had given notice that they had arrested some suspects.\n\nAbout an 80km (50-mile) journey from el-Fasher, Tawila is one of several places where those lucky enough to escape the RSF fighters are fleeing to.\n\n\"We left el-Fasher four days ago. The suffering we encountered on the way was unimaginable,\" Ezzeldin says.\n\n\"We were divided into groups and beaten. The scenes were extremely brutal. We saw people murdered in front of us. We saw people being beaten. It was really terrible.\n\n\"I myself was hit on the head, back, and legs. They beat me with sticks. They wanted to execute us completely. But when the opportunity arose, we ran, while others in front were detained.\"\n\nEzzeldin says he joined a group of escapees who took shelter in a building, moving by night and sometimes literally crawling along the ground in an effort to remain hidden.\n\n\"Our belongings were stolen,\" he says. \"Phones, clothes - everything. Literally, even my shoes were stolen. Nothing was left.\n\n\"We went without food for three days while walking in the streets. By God's mercy, we made it through.\"\n\nThose in Tawila told the BBC that men making the journey were particularly likely to be subjected to scrutiny by the RSF, with fighters targeting anyone suspected of being a soldier.\n\nEzzeldin is one of around 5,000 people thought to have arrived in Tawila since the fall of el-Fasher on Sunday.\n\nMany have made the entire journey on foot, travelling for three or four days to flee the violence.\n\nA freelance journalist based in Tawila, working for the BBC, has conducted among the first interviews with some of those who made the journey.\n\nNear to Ezzeldin sits Ahmed Ismail Ibrahim, his body bandaged in several places.\n\nHe says his eye was injured in an artillery strike, and he left the city on Sunday after receiving treatment in hospital.\n\nHe and six other men were stopped by RSF fighters.\n\n\"Four of them - they killed them in front of us. Beat them and killed them,\" he says, adding that he was shot three times.\n\nAhmed describes how the fighters demanded to see the phones of the three who were left alive and went through them, searching their messages.\n\nOne fighter, he says, finally told them: \"OK, get up and go.\" They fled into the scrub.\n\n\"My brothers,\" he adds, \"they didn't leave me behind.\n\n\"We walked for about 10 minutes, then rested for 10 minutes, and we continued until we found peace now.\"\n\nIn the next tent in the clinic run by medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Yusra Ibrahim Mohamed describes making the decision to flee the city after her husband, a soldier with the Sudanese army, was killed.\n\n\"My husband was in the artillery,\" she says. \"He was returning home and was killed during the attacks.\n\n\"We stayed patient. Then the clashes and attacks continued. We managed to escape.\n\n\"We left three days ago,\" she says, \"moving in different directions from the artillery areas. The people guiding us didn't know what was happening.\n\n\"If someone resisted, they were beaten or robbed. They would take everything you had. People could even be executed. I saw dead bodies in the streets.\"\n\nAlfadil Dukhan works in the MSF clinic.\n\nHe and his colleagues have been providing emergency care to those who arrive - among them, he says, are 500 in need of urgent medical treatment.\n\n\"Most of the new arrivals are elders and women or children,\" the medic says.\n\n\"The wounded are suffering, and some of them they already have amputations.\n\n\"So they are really suffering a lot. And we are trying to just give them some support and some medical care.\"\n\nThose arriving this week in Tawila join hundreds of thousands there who fled previous rounds of violence in el-Fasher.\n\nBefore its seizure by the RSF on Sunday, the city had been besieged for 18 months.\n\nThose trapped inside were bombarded by a barrage of deadly artillery and air strikes as the army and the paramilitaries battled for el-Fasher.\n\nAnd they were plunged into a severe hunger crisis by an RSF blockade of supplies and aid.\n\nHundreds of thousands were displaced in April when the RSF seized control of the Zamzam camp close to the city, at the time one of the main sites housing people forced to flee fighting elsewhere.\n\nSome experts have expressed concern at the relatively low numbers arriving at places like Tawila now.\n\n\"This is actually a point of worry for us,\" says Caroline Bouvoir, who works with refugees in neighbouring Chad for the aid agency Solidarités International\n\n\"In the past few days we have about 5,000 people who have arrived, which considering we believe there were about a quarter of a million people still in the city, that is obviously not that many,\" she says.\n\n\"We see the conditions that those who have arrived are in. They are highly malnourished, highly dehydrated, or sick or injured, and they are clearly traumatised with what they have seen either in the city or on the road.\n\n\"We believe that many people are stuck currently in different locations between Tawila and el-Fasher, and unable to move forward - either because of their physical condition or because of the insecurity on the road, where militias are unfortunately attacking people who are trying to find safe haven.\"\n\nFor Ezzeldin the relief of having reached safety is tempered by the fears for those still behind him on the journey.\n\n\"My message is that public roads should be secured for citizens,\" he pleads, \"or humanitarian aid sent to the streets.\n\n\"People are in a critical state - they can't move, speak, or seek help.\n\n\"Aid should reach them, because many are missing and suffering.\"\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x1ry124eqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:23:07.984+00:00","title":"Australian influencer family move to UK to avoid social media ban","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Australian influencer family known as the Empire Family—consisting of parents Beck and Bec Lea, and their children Prezley and Charlotte—is relocating from Perth to London to avoid Australia’s upcoming social media ban for under-16s, which begins in December 2025.

world's tallest church\n\nThe Sagrada Família has become the tallest church in the world, after workers placed the first part of a cross at the top of its central tower.\n\nNow measuring 162.91 metres tall, the Spanish basilica has officially pipped the record from the Ulm Minster in Germany, which has held the crown since 1890.\n\nDesigned by acclaimed architect Antoni Gaudí, the place of worship has been under construction in the centre of Barcelona for more than a century, with the main building due to be completed next year.\n\nThe central Tower of Jesus Christ will grow with the addition of the rest of the cross over the next few months, eventually standing at 172 metres tall.\n\nThe first stone of the Sagrada Família was placed in 1882, with up-and-coming architect Gaudí taking over the project the following year.\n\nHe transformed the original designs for the basilica into a far more ambitious proposal, which was initially funded by donations from repentant worshippers.\n\nAt the time of his unexpected death in 1926, just one of the planned 18 towers had been built.\n\nIn the years following, the construction of the architectural marvel was managed by the Sagrada Família foundation, and funded by contributions from tourists, visitors and private donors.\n\nIn addition to the death of its primary architect, the basilica has hit a number of roadblocks throughout its almost 150-year construction.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, Catalan anarchists set fire to the crypt, destroying plans and plaster models created by Gaudí that would guide future construction.\n\nMost recently, the Covid-19 pandemic saw construction on the building halted, with members of the foundation attributing the pause to a lack of tourism, and the subsequent drop in funding for the project.\n\nIn September this year, Sagrada Família General Director Xavier Martínez told the Associated Press that the Tower of Jesus Christ would be completed in 2026, to coincide with the centenary of Gaudí's death.\n\nThe foundation will hold a series of events to commemorate the architect, who is buried in the church's crypt.\n\nWork on decorative details, sculptures and a

hurricane, one of the most powerful to strike the Caribbean, has also killed at least 30 people in Haiti, officials said.\n\nIn Jamaica, \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened,\" Dixon said, adding there are \"devastating\" scenes in western regions.\n\nElectricity remains out to most of the island and as people try to salvage damaged homes and belongings from floodwaters and mud, many thousands are growing increasingly desperate for aid.\n\nThere are parts of the country that have been without water for several days and food is growing increasingly scarce.\n\nAid supplies are starting to arrive more rapidly with the main airport in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, largely back to normal.\n\nBut smaller regional airports, some of which are located near to where humanitarian assistance is most needed, remain only partly operational.\n\nAs such, aid agencies and the military are bringing in the urgently needed supplies from Kingston via road, many of which remain unpassable in places.\n\nSatellite imagery shows  nearly all buildings in some Jamaican villages  have been destroyed by the hurricane.\n\nResidents of towns in western Jamaica told the BBC on Thursday that \"words can't explain how devastating\" the storm has been on the country.\n\n\"No one is able to get through to their loved ones,\" Trevor 'Zyanigh' Whyte told the BBC from the town of White House in Westmoreland parish.\n\n\"Everyone is just, you know, completely disconnected... Every tree is on the road, right, so you can't get too far with the cars, not even a bicycle,\" he said.\n\nIn Haiti, many of the victims in the storm died when a river overflowed in Petit-Goave. A full assessment is ongoing, as there are still areas that authorities have not been able to access.\n\nAround 15,000 people were staying in more than 120 shelters in Haiti, interim UN co-ordinator for the country Gregoire Goodstein said.\n\nIn Cuba, more than 3 million people were \"exposed to life-threatening conditions\" during the hurricane, with 735,000 people \"safely evacuated\", according to the UN's resident co-ordinator for Cuba Francisco Pichon.\n\nNo fatalities have been reported so far in Cuba, but almost 240 communities have been cut off due to flooding and landslides, Cuban authorities said.\n\nHurricane Melissa made landfall on Tuesday in Jamaica as a category five storm, packing winds of up to 185 mph (295 km/h), before impacting other countries in the Caribbean.\n\nGovernments, humanitarian organisations and individuals around the world are pledging support for the nations hardest hit by the storm.\n\nThe World Food Programme said it is collaborating with partners to coordinate logistics, cash and emergency supplies across Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe US State Department said it is deploying a disaster response team to the region to help with search and rescue operations, and assisting in efforts to provide food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits and temporary shelters.\n\nThe UK government on Friday said it is mobilising an additional £5m ($6m) to send humanitarian supplies, including shelter kits and solar powered lanterns, to help people without power and whose homes have been damaged.\n\nThat is on top of £2.5m ($3.36m) already announced in emergency humanitarian funding to support recovery in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Foreign Office is also preparing flights to evacuate British nationals unable to come home on commercial flights.\n\nWhile Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti assessed the damage left in Melissa's wake, Bermuda braced for impact.\n\nThe Bermuda Weather Service expected Melissa to be a category two hurricane when it passed the British overseas territory on Thursday night.\n\nGovernment offices in Bermuda will close until Friday afternoon and all schools will shut on Friday.\n\n\"Until the official 'All Clear' is issued, residents are urged to stay off the roads so Government work crews can safely assess and clear debris,\" a public alert from the government said.\n\nIf you experienced the hurricane in Jamaica,  please share your story ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qp75z3dw4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:21:33.508+00:00","title":"Buckingham Palace statement on Prince Andrew in full","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Buckingham Palace has formally stripped Prince Andrew of his royal titles, including the Duke of York, and has announced that he will be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.

scandals, all the titles and privileges of the former Prince Andrew have been completely removed.\n\nThere are no modern precedents for such a colossal loss of royal status.\n\nUnlike the previous statement on his future, this was from Buckingham Palace rather than Andrew himself.\n\nIt's a ripping off the bandage moment, which the Palace will hope will finally draw a line under the endless oil slick of bad news stories about Andrew.\n\nThe sliver of dignity given to him, that he was voluntarily choosing not to use his titles, has been taken away.\n\nTitles such as Duke of York, the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh will be forcibly removed.\n\nAll that remains is his place in the line of succession, and new guidance from the House of Commons Library has shown that too could be removed by Parliament, if Commonwealth realms give their consent.\n\nAfter more than a year of pressure, the so-called Siege of Royal Lodge is over, with Andrew losing his independent lease and moving to the King's estate in Sandringham. It's not revealed where exactly, but it's not Wood Farm.\n\nSandringham is privately owned by the King, ending any reliance on a Crown Estate property.\n\nHis ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is said to be making her own separate arrangements, not currently expected to be with Andrew in Norfolk.\n\nIt makes Andrew dependent on the King for his home and his money. And also it has to be said, a duty of care for his brother's welfare.\n\nThis announcement might head off the immediate threat of Parliament taking matters into its own hands and voting to strip Andrew of his titles. MPs had become increasingly vocal about debating the scandal and the Public Accounts Committee had been flexing its muscles over protecting public funding.\n\nBut it's going to be much harder for the Palace to settle an authentic feeling of public outrage. The sense of unchecked privilege surrounding Andrew has genuinely irritated the public and it will take more than taking away his titles to dispel the sense of ugly entitlement.\n\nPolling by YouGov published on Thursday showed Andrew now has the worst ever popularity ratings for a royal, with 91% holding a negative view of him.\n\nAnd the King heard that unhappiness first hand from a heckler in Lichfield this week, who shouted: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\"\n\nFor the Palace, there will be questions about why such longstanding problems around Andrew weren't dealt with before now. So much of this has been known for so many years, the unsuitable business links, the unexplained funding, the connections with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The cast list changes - alleged Chinese spies or dictators' wealthy relatives - but the story has remained the same.\n\nThe unsavoury link with Epstein was being widely discussed 14 years ago when Andrew was stripped of his role as trade representative.\n\nAndrew has been losing jobs but continuing to live in a royal style for many years now and it's stretched public patience. It felt arrogant and out of touch.\n\nA few clicks on Google will find decades of stories raising doubts about his suitability, often accompanied by pictures of Andrew in a top hat, like a renegade Monopoly piece.\n\nThere might be some public fatigue around this Andrew story, people might feel they've heard enough and are sick of it. But there was also an angry public mood that expected a clearer sense of accountability.\n\nWhat remains to be seen now is whether a wider can of worms has been opened.\n\nWho knew what and when at the Palace about Andrew and Epstein? Do we need more transparency around royal property and finance? How many houses do they have up their sleeve in Windsor? And what fresh scandals about Andrew could still emerge?\n\nBut this scorched earth approach to Andrew's future might also show an unexpectedly steely side to the King.\n\nWhile other members of the Royal Family were part of the decision, including Prince William, it's understood that it was the King who made this big call on his brother's future. Whatever the grandstanding of pundits, it can't have been an easy decision.\n\nThere seemed to have been an irrevocable change of attitude when  an email from Andrew to Epstein emerged,  showing their continued contact. It seemed to destroy Andrew's promises in the Newsnight interview to have cut ties.\n\nIt no longer seemed tenable that Andrew should have the honour of being a prince and living in some splendour among the royals in Windsor.\n\nInstead the King highlighted the victims of abuse, whose stories lie at the dark heart of Epstein's circle.\n\nIt's not long since Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, was grinning on the Buckingham Palace balcony, waving to the crowds. He'll wake up tomorrow morning for the first time in his life as Mr Mountbatten Windsor, private citizen.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis  every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

Has Money It Can’t Spend to Prevent Food Stamp Cuts\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T11:20:33-04:00\n\nThe Trump administration staunchly defended its decision to stop paying food stamps during the government shutdown, insisting that a range of legal, technical and budgetary constraints would prevent it from providing a tranche of available funds to millions of poor Americans in November.\n\nIn a new set of court filings, submitted late Wednesday, administration officials acknowledged that they had billions of dollars left over across multiple federal accounts. The amounts appeared to total more than would be needed to cover the full costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, for the next month.\n\nBut lawyers for the Justice Department signaled that the administration could not, or would not, use those funds, leaving 42 million food stamp recipients at risk of cuts to their benefits beginning on Nov. 1.\n\nThe Trump administration repeatedly argued that there were legal obstacles to transferring existing funds to SNAP, technical hurdles in remitting payments quickly and other budgetary constraints to consider at the Agriculture Department, where the money would originate.\n\nThe arguments set the stage for what is likely to be a tense, high-stakes hearing on Thursday morning in Massachusetts, where more than two dozen states have asked a judge to force the Trump administration to reprogram the budget and provision full aid for food stamps before Nov. 1.\n\nIn its filings, the Trump administration acknowledged that an interruption to food stamps would create a “difficult situation for millions of Americans,” but it insisted the court did not have the ability to prevent it.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

has been stripped of his \"prince\" title and will leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nThe King has \"initiated a formal process\" to remove his titles, it said, and Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\n\nAndrew, 65 - the King's younger brother - has continued to face more questions about his private life in recent months.\n\nHis links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein have caused problems for the Royal Family. The prince, who relinquished his titles this month, has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe dramatic fall from grace affects now just him but his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and their children, Beatrice and Eugenie.\n\n\"His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew,\" Buckingham Palace  said in a statement  on Thursday evening.\n\n\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\"\n\nIt also addressed the place where he lives, Royal Lodge.\n\n\"His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence.\n\n\"Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation. These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.\n\n\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"\n\nThe language of Buckingham Palace's statement was \"very brutal,\" royal historian Kelly Swaby told the BBC.\n\n\"Ordinary people don't care about the semantics, they want to see punishment, and public opinion is very much against Andrew, the Palace knows that, and the language very much reflect that\".\n\nThe decision was made, and action taken, due to serious lapses in Andrew's judgement, it is understood.\n\nIt is also understood that the wider Royal Family and the government was consulted, and made clear it supports the decision.\n\nThe BBC's former royal correspondent Jennie Bond said she thought the Prince of Wales had pushed for the recent action.\n\n\"I think this line had to be drawn and William was probably pushing for the King to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"William is about to go to Brazil on a very important tour - and the the recent tour by the King and Queen to the Vatican was very nearly overshadowed by what was going on with Andrew, and that could not be allowed to continue.\"\n\nIt is understood Andrew will be relocated to the  Sandringham Estate  in Norfolk, but details about his specific housing have not been released.\n\nThe wider Sandringham estate covers approximately 20,000 acres (8,100 hectares) with 600 acres (242 hectares) of gardens - and the Palace has not said which property he will stay in.\n\nIt is understood that Andrew is unlikely to move into Sandringham's Wood Farm, his late father's former home.\n\nFormal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday and it is understood that Andrew's move to Sandringham will take place \"as soon as practicable\".\n\nAndrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, 66, will also move out of Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements, it is understood.\n\nShe lost her courtesy royal divorcee title as a duchess in early October, when Andrew lost the use of his Duke of York title - reverting to her maiden name.\n\nThough the public had long referred to her as \"Fergie\", royal commentator Richard Palmer  told the BBC at the time  the title change would \"no doubt\" have an impact.\n\n\"She will have lost a bit of cachet over this,\" he said. \"She certainly does use the title – even her Twitter bio is @SarahTheDuchess.\"\n\nFor their daughters - Beatrice, 37 and Eugenie, 35 - there is no formal change.\n\nThey will still be princesses because they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign - in line with King George V's Letters Patent of 1917.\n\nTheir places in the line of succession will also stay the same.\n\nAndrew remains eighth in line to the throne despite losing his titles - followed by Beatrice and Eugenie in ninth and twelfth place.\n\nBut their positions in the family are \"low down\" and will likely slip further with time, royal commentator Victoria Murphy said previously - adding that she could not see them, as non-working royals, step into official duties any time soon.\n\nThere was an \"appreciation of the fact that this scandal doesn't involve them,\" she also said, \"and it's not fair for it to impact them directly in the independent lives they are carving out for themselves\".\n\nIt is understood Andrew's accommodation will be privately funded by the King.\n\nAnd the King will make \"appropriate private provision\" for his brother as he moves out of his home.\n\nRoyal sources have previously said the King has tried to apply pressure, and last year cut off Andrew's funding.\n\nAndrew also cultivated his own independent sources of funding since leaving public life, including business connections with China, the Gulf States and a recently curtailed project with a Dutch start-up company.\n\nEarlier this week, Parliament's spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee wrote a letter detailing the \"considerable and understandable public interest in the spending of public money\" relating to Andrew.\n\nThe letter asked what the Crown Estate's plan was to ensure value for money in any future agreements with Andrew.\n\nAndrew is understood not to have objected to the King's decision to remove his titles.\n\nHis birth certificate does not need to be changed and the title change will not apply retrospectively.\n\nThe titles being stripped are: Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh. And he will no longer have the right to be called His Royal Highness. The honours of Order of the Garter and Knight Grand Cross of the Victorian Order will also be removed.\n\nTo remove the titles, the King will send Royal warrants to the Lord Chancellor - who is David Lammy - to officially remove them.\n\nIt comes just weeks after Andrew voluntarily gave up his other royal titles, including the Duke of York.\n\nOn 17 October, Andrew said he would stop using the titles because the \"continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family\". \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\" he said.\n\nUntil this month, Ferguson kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York - but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew was stripped of his Duke of York title.\n\nThe surname Mountbatten Windsor was created in 1960, and combines the surnames of the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip when they married.\n\nIn 1917, fearful of the anti-German sentiment in the UK the reigning monarch, George V, adopted the name Windsor to replace the original Germanic sounding house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty.\n\nHe renamed the lineage Windsor, after the castle.\n\nMountbatten is an anglicised version of Battenberg. The Duke of Edinburgh's mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg, but during the First World War the family opted to change it to Mountbatten, again to avoid more anti-German sentiment.\n\nThe double-barrelled name was a concession to the Duke of Edinburgh, who was said to have complained that his children would not bear his name.\n\nHistorians tell the BBC Andrew will continue to be frozen out of royal public life.\n\nHe is already not invited to attend royal public events., and his recent appearances have been limited to private, family events, such as funerals or memorials.\n\nThis fiasco will continue to dog the royal family, says historian and author Andrew Lownie.\n\n\"They're finally getting ahead of the story, but this isn't the end of it,\" Lownie told the BBC.\n\nThe Palace is \"finally taking some decisive action\" - but it \"won't completely satisfy the public disquiet\".\n\nCampaigners against the monarchy say there should be a wider investigation into what the Royal Family might have known about Prince Andrew's links to Epstein.\n\n\"This isn't just about family. It's not a private matter,\" says Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic.\n\nAndrew's links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are at the centre of this latest announcement.\n\nIn recent weeks, pressure has increased on the monarchy to resolve the issue of Charles's brother, with the King heckled earlier this week by a protester.\n\nAlthough Andrew denies the accusations, the Royal Family considers there have been \"serious lapses of judgement\" in his behaviour.\n\nEarlier this month, emails from 2011 re-emerged, showing Andrew in contact with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein months after he claimed their friendship ended.\n\nIn her posthumous memoir, Nobody's Girl Virginia Giuffre repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions – claims he has always denied."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24nwz9pd4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:35:22.908+00:00","title":"5 charged in overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five individuals — Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas — have been charged with running a fentanyl-laced counterfeit prescription opioid distribution network in New York City between January and July 2023.

Russia's repressive past\n\nIn a wood on the edge of St Petersburg they're reading out a list of names.\n\nEach name is a victim of the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's Great Terror.\n\nIn this part of Russia there are thousands of names to be read. Thousands of lives to remember on Russia's annual Remembrance Day for Victims of Political Repression.\n\nBuried in the Levashovo Wasteland are believed to be at least 20,000 people - possibly as many as 45,000 - who were denounced, shot and disposed of in mass graves; individuals, as well as whole families destroyed in the dictator's purge in the 1930s.\n\nNailed to the trunks of pine trees are portraits of the executed. Standing here you can feel the ghosts of Russia's past.\n\nBut what of the present?\n\nToday, Russian authorities speak less about Stalin's crimes against his own people, preferring to portray the dictator as a victorious wartime leader.\n\nWhat's more, in recent years a string of repressive laws has been adopted here to punish dissent and silence criticism of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nKremlin critics might not be denounced as \"enemies of the people\" like under Stalin. But increasingly they are being designated \"foreign agents\".\n\nThe authorities claim the labelling helps to protect Russia from external threats.\n\nMore than three and a half years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities have two main objectives: victory abroad and conformity at home.\n\nAnyone here who publicly challenges, questions or even hints they doubt the official narrative that, in this war Russia is in the right, risks becoming a target.\n\nAt Leninsky District Courthouse, the stairwell outside Courtroom 11 is packed with journalists. There is barely room to move.\n\nI get talking to Irina. Her daughter Diana is on her way here in a police car for a court appearance.\n\n\"This must be frightening for you,\" I say.\n\nIrina nods.\n\n\"I never thought anything like this could happen,\" says Irina softly. \"You can't imagine it. Until it happens to you.\"\n\nMinutes later, 18-year-old Diana Loginova arrives in the building guarded by three police officers. She hugs her mother and is taken into court.\n\nDiana has already spent 13 days in jail for \"organising a mass public gathering of citizens resulting in a violation of public order\".\n\nBut the charges keep coming.\n\nThe \"mass gathering\" was an improvised street concert which the authorities claim obstructed pedestrian access to a Metro station.\n\nDiana Loginova is a music student and, under the name Naoko, lead singer with the band Stoptime.\n\nOn the streets of St Petersburg, Stoptime have been performing songs by exiled Russian artists like Noize MC and Monetochka, singer-songwriters fiercely critical of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nMany of these prominent musicians, now abroad, have been officially designated foreign agents by Russian authorities.\n\nVideos posted online show that Stoptime's street concerts have been attracting quite a crowd, with dozens of mainly young people singing along and dancing to the music.\n\nWhilst it is not forbidden in Russia to sing or play songs by foreign agents, in May a Russian court banned Noize MC's track Swan Lake Cooperative, claiming it contained \"propaganda for the violent change of the constitutional order\".\n\nSwan Lake is seen by many as a symbol of political change in Russia.\n\nIn the USSR, Soviet TV often showed the ballet following the death of Soviet leaders, and it was back on Soviet TV screens in 1991 during the failed coup by communist hardliners. Lake (Ozero in Russian) is also the name of a dacha co-operative widely associated with President Putin's inner circle.\n\nA video clip of Stoptime performing the song went viral recently on social media.\n\nDiana Loginova was detained on 15 October. Police also arrested her boyfriend, guitarist Alexander Orlov, and drummer, Vladislav Leontyev.\n\nThe three band members were sentenced to between 12 and 13 days behind bars.\n\nIn Courtroom 11 Diana is facing an additional charge: discrediting the Russian armed forces. It relates to one of the songs she sang: You're a Soldier by (\"foreign agent\") Monetochka.\n\n\" You're a soldier, \" begins the chorus.\n\n\"And whatever war you are fighting,\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'll be on the other side.\"\n\nAfter a brief hearing the judge finds Diana guilty of discrediting Russia's army and fines her 30,000 roubles (£285).\n\nBut she is not free to go. The police take Diana back to the police station and prepare more charges.\n\nThe next day she and her boyfriend Alexander are brought to Smolninsky District Court. I manage to have a word with them before they enter the courtroom.\n\n\"I'm very pleased, and it's important, that people have been supporting us, that many people are on our side, on the side of truth,\" Diana tells me.\n\n\"I'm surprised by how things have been exaggerated. We've been accused of lots of things we didn't do. All we were doing was bringing the music we like to a mass audience. The power of music is very important. What's happening now proves that.\"\n\n\"I think it's not the words, it's the music that is most important,\" guitarist Alexander Orlov tells me. \"Music says everything for people. It always has.\"\n\nAlexander reveals he proposed to Diana when the police van they were being transported in stopped at a petrol station.\n\n\"I made a ring out of a tissue,\" he tells me. \"I had time to get on my knees, and she said yes.\"\n\n\"We hope we'll be back home soon,\" says Diana. \"That's what we're dreaming of most.\"\n\nThey won't be going home yet. At this latest court hearing the judge sends Diana and Alexander back to jail for another 13 days for more public order offences.\n\nCivil society in Russia is under intense pressure. Yet supporters of Diana Loginova and Stoptime are trying to make their voices heard.\n\n\"I was on the street when Diana was singing and people were singing along so beautifully,\" says Alla outside the courthouse. \"For me it was important to be here to support Diana and show her some people do care. This should not be happening.\"\n\nTo another of Diana's supporters I suggest that, in Russia now, displaying solidarity for anyone accused of discrediting the Russian army requires a degree of courage.\n\n\"It's people like Diana who are the brave ones,\" says Sasha. \"We're cowards. Some people are heroes. Others just follow behind.\"\n\n\"Some people [in Russia] are scared,\" continues Sasha. \"But others here do support the authorities and what's going on. Unfortunately, I know people like this. It came as a blow when I discovered that people I've been friends with for 40 years support what's happening. For years they've been watching Russian TV. I haven't.\"\n\nIn the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Mikhailov expressed his solidarity through music. The street musician performed songs in support of Diana Loginova. He was detained and jailed for 14 days for \"petty hooliganism\".\n\nDespite the crackdown, young street musicians in St Petersburg continue to perform music by artists labelled foreign agents by Russian authorities.\n\nIt's a chilly autumn evening. But passers-by have stopped to listen to a teenage band outside a St Petersburg Metro station. Among the songs they're performing are compositions by \"foreign agents\" Noize MC and Morgenshtern.\n\nSuddenly the police turn up. The concert is over.\n\nI look on as three band members are taken away in a police car.\n\nI go to meet someone else in St Petersburg accused of \"discreditation\".\n\nLudmila Vasilyeva, 84, was born two months before Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nShe survived the Nazi siege of Leningrad (then the name for St Petersburg) and has carried with her all her life how devastating war can be.\n\nSo, when Vladimir Putin ordered a mass invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ludmila was deeply shocked.\n\nEarlier this year, on the third anniversary of Russia's \"special military operation\", Ludmila went on to the street to express her anti-war stance.\n\n\"I wrote on my placard: 'People! Let's stop the war. We bear responsibility for peace on Planet Earth!'\"\n\nFollowing her personal protest Ludmila received a letter from the police instructing her to report to the police station.\n\n\"They told me that I had discredited our soldiers. How? By calling for peace? I let them know that everything I'd wanted to say I'd already made quite clear on my placard and that I wouldn't be going down to the station. They threatened to take me to court. And in the end that's what they did.\"\n\nLudmila was fined 10,000 roubles (£95) for \"discrediting the Russian armed forces\".\n\nShe has no regrets and seemingly, despite the growing repression around her, no fear.\n\n\"Why should I be scared?\" Ludmila asks me. \"Of what and of whom should I be frightened? I'm not scared of anyone. I speak the truth. And they know that.\"\n\nShe believes that increasing authoritarianism stems from those in power fearing the public.\n\n\"People are scared. But [the authorities] are more scared. That's why they're tightening the screws.\"\n\nLudmila Vasilyeva's outspokenness is an exception, not the rule. Today few Russians engage in public protest. I ask Ludmila why that is: is it fear, indifference, or because of support for the authorities?\n\n\"Most people are focused on their own lives, on just surviving,\" Ludmila replies.\n\nBut she claims that when she speaks her mind publicly many people agree with her.\n\n\"When I go to the shops, I always strike up a conversation. No one has ever sneaked on me or put in a complaint about me.\n\n\"Once I was saying something down at the post office. Someone turned to me and said: 'Quiet, keep it down.' I replied: 'Why should I be quiet? What I'm saying, isn't it the truth? Truth must be spoken loudly.'\"\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n\"When I was standing with my placard and talking to a policeman, a man in his 50s came up to us. He leant forward and said: 'Just strangle her.'\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3mdvle78o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:11:41.551+00:00","title":"The US bet big on Argentina bailout - is it paying off?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has led a significant financial intervention in Argentina by purchasing up to $2bn in pesos and establishing a $20bn currency swap line in mid-2025, aimed at stabilizing the economy and protecting Trump ally President Javier Milei’s political position ahead of the midterm elections.

entrusted with selling financial markets on some of President Donald Trump's riskiest economic gambles: sweeping global tariffs, trade talks with China and preparations to install a new leader at the US central bank.\n\nBut Bessent's trickiest task may just be the White House bet on Argentina.\n\nThe US stepped onto the scene in mid-September, responding to a plunge in the peso - the Argentine currency - which officials feared could imperil Trump ally President Javier Milei and his party in looming midterm elections.\n\nBessent said the US would do whatever was needed to stabilise the situation, calling the country a key ally in the region.\n\nIn political terms, the US intervention - which included purchases of pesos and the establishment of a $20bn (£15bn) currency swap line that gives the Argentine central bank access to dollars - was a success for Milei.\n\nHis party not only fended off losses in the midterm elections but made inroads, strengthening his position.\n\nBut whether the US intervention in the country will be a success financially is another question.\n\nThe peso has fallen roughly 30% this year, including roughly 4% over the last month. The drop came despite the US commitments - and a modest rally after the election.\n\nIt's an indication of the ongoing risk. At the end of the day, the US could find itself holding a pile of pesos worth much less than they were originally.\n\nThe intervention in Argentina was a highly unusual move - especially from a White House known for its \"America First\" approach.\n\nMilei has endeared himself to conservatives in the US with his embrace of free-market reforms and radical spending cuts. He has met frequently with Trump, who has called him his \"favourite president\".\n\nBut the US has rarely offered financial bailouts to other countries - especially in a case that posed no wider financial stability risks - and direct purchases of a struggling emerging market currency are unprecedented, says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAdding to the risk is Argentina's long history of currency devaluation and debt default, including most recently in 2020.\n\nFew are positioned to be as aware of the potential pitfalls as Bessent, who made his name as a currency trader working for George Soros.\n\nBessent famously took part in the 1992 speculation against the British pound. At that time, investors who bet that Sterling had been overvalued were said to have broken the Bank of England with their heavy selling.\n\nThis time, Bessent finds himself on the opposite side of similar gamble. He has defended his moves, invoking the spectre of fellow South American country, Venezuela, and arguing that failure to shore up Argentina as a US ally could lead to destabilisation in the region.\n\n\"These results are a clear example that the Trump Administration policy of Peace through Economic Strength is working,\" Bessent wrote on social media after the recent election in Argentina.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bessent posted again to say: \"the Argentine economic bridge has now turned a profit for the American people\".\n\nThe US Treasury Department did not respond to inquiries seeking more details.\n\nBut it has kept quiet about key information needed to assess Bessent's claims - including the timeline and scale of its peso purchases - or sales - and what, if any, other assets the Argentine government pledged in order to secure the swap deal.\n\nAnalysts have estimated the US has purchased as much as $2bn worth of pesos so far - hardly an earth-shattering figure.\n\nBut Democrats have criticised the help at a time of White House spending cuts and an ongoing government shutdown, accusing Bessent of wanting to protect finance \"buddies\" with investments in the country.\n\nEven some members of Trump's own Republican Party have questioned how the aid aligns with the president's \"America First\" goals.\n\nBessent has disputed any characterisation of the US support for Argentina as a \"bailout\", promising there will be \"no taxpayer losses\" and even declaring the peso \"undervalued\".\n\nBut while that could be true for a short-term trade, that view is not the general consensus.\n\nTo the contrary - most analysts say the peso is overvalued, but has been propped up by support from the Argentine central bank, which set trading limits for the peso in April.\n\nEconomists say maintaining such limits is not sustainable. They cite the surge in Argentines travelling to make purchases in neighbouring countries where their money travels farther as one of the signs that the peso is being held artificially high.\n\nThe Argentine central bank has insisted it is committed to the trading band, which was intended to protect the country from wild currency swings destabilising prices and support Milei's efforts to control inflation.\n\nBut it has already had to spend billions buying pesos to keep the currency steady, burning through International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding and dipping into its foreign reserves, which are key to paying its debt obligations.\n\nEconomists say they expect the bank will have to change its policy to allow the peso to fall more - or the country risks needing another bailout.\n\nThat choice presents a dilemma for Bessent, given his promises to guard the US against losses.\n\n\"Is the US willing to provide support to Argentina so that Argentina can defend the peso at this level?\" Mr Setser asks. \"Bessent has to decide in a sense whether to double down... or he has to let the peso adjust and recognise that his intervention was a bridge to the election.\"\n\nThe peso plummeted ahead of the midterms, as businesses and households in Argentina rushed to trade the currency for dollars.\n\nPeople wanted to protect themselves, remembering the way the currency collapsed in 2019   after the election loss of former president Mauricio Macri, who was also known for economic reform,   says Joaquín Bagües, managing director of Buenos Aires-based Grit Capital Group.\n\n\"Every single guy that I talked to, they wanted to buy dollars... they have very fresh memories about that,\" he said, describing the run as a \"confidence crisis.\"\n\nMr Bagües says the demand for dollars has eased since the election.\n\nBut the peso has not experienced the kind of sustained relief seen in other assets, like bonds or the stock market, which surged more than 20% the day after the election and has continued to rise.\n\nWhile Argentine companies are starting to tap international lending markets again, after being frozen out ahead of the election, analysts say they expect US banks to remain wary of lending to Argentina, despite a push by Bessent to arrange an additional $20bn in private financing.\n\nAnd Mr Bagües says there are too many policy questions ahead to predict what will happen to the peso.\n\nKathryn Exum, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy Funds Management, suggests that the peso could rise \"over the medium term\" if the government is able to continue advancing economic reforms.\n\nBut, she adds, \"there's a lot that needs to be done between now and then\".\n\nFor now, Anthony Simond, investment director on the emerging market debt team at Aberdeen Group, says he expects the peso has farther to fall.\n\n\"Bessent may say one thing, but I think the economic reality may force them to be a little bit more flexible in terms of currency management,\" he says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rjnlv8ejxo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:42:57.541+00:00","title":"Martha Kearney: Why I'm concerned about our declining wildflowers","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the alarming decline of wildflower meadows in the UK, with nearly 97% lost since the 1930s, and the broader ecological and economic consequences.

I have fond memories of the woods in Sussex, where I grew up, filling with primroses early in the year and carpeted with bluebells in the spring.\n\nI always used their nicknames - \"eggs and bacon\" for birds-foot-trefoil (a native plant known for its yellow slipper-like petals) and \"bread-and-cheese\" for the young shoots of the British tree hawthorn, which my friends and I would eat. And pretend to like!\n\nWe picked rosehips from hedges too, which we split open to make itching powder, perfect for playground pranks.\n\nBut later in life, on my walks through the countryside, I began to notice dwindling numbers of wildflowers. I missed the grasslands, bursting with colour, that I'd so enjoyed in my childhood.\n\nAccording to the charity Plantlife, approximately 97% of wildflower meadows have been lost across the UK since the 1930s, while species-rich grassland areas, which used to be a common sight, are now among the most threatened habitats.\n\n\"It's definitely a story of severe overall decline, both in the cover of flowers but also the diversity,\" explains Simon Potts, professor of biodiversity and ecosystem services at Reading University.\n\nSo, what will happen if there isn't more intervention to save wildflowers? What will the future look like?\n\n\"Awful, in a word,\" says Prof Potts. \"If we, let's say, take a scenario where we just continue business as usual as we are now, we will still keep losing our wildflowers.\n\n\"And with that, we lose the beneficial biodiversity like the pollinators and the natural enemies of pests.\"\n\nAs a bee lover I am on team pollinator - which is one of the reasons why my husband and I decided to plant our own wildflower meadow. Not just for the beautiful colours but for the vibrancy of the bees, butterflies and moths flying around, which need that habitat.\n\nYet since then, I've come to understand that the loss of wildflowers could bring other perhaps more unexpected consequences too.\n\n\"The consequence will be for farmers,\" argues Prof Potts. \"They will get low yields and poor quality crops, consumers will have to pay higher prices. Our environment will be degraded, eroded, will have less wildlife.\n\n\"Many of them [wildflowers] produce nectar and pollen, which is super important for things like wild bees, hoverflies, and butterflies, that can pollinate crops.\"\n\nProf Daniel Gibbs, food security lead at the University of Birmingham's School of Biosciences, also has concerns about the long-term consequences.\n\n\"Over time, and alongside pressures from climate change and land degradation, this could make our food system more fragile, and negatively impact food security,\" he says - meaning we could, for example, find ourselves with more limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nThere are also studies showing that fields near wildflower-rich margins or meadows produce better-quality fruit and higher yields.\n\n\"Wildflowers can also support some bugs, like spiders and carabid beetles… [which] do an absolutely fantastic job in controlling some of the pests that we get on crops - that can either damage the crop or sometimes lower the quality of the produce,\" adds Prof Potts.\n\nHe describes wildflowers as almost like little factories, pumping out beneficial bits of biodiversity that can help with food production.\n\n\"Farmers may have to rely more on manual pollination,\" Prof Gibbs says. \"Or we may need to look to increasing food imports, both of which can drive up prices.\"\n\nMultiple factors are behind the decline. Sarah Shuttleworth, a botanist with Plantlife, argues that certain intensive farming methods have contributed.\n\nBut some intensive farming methods have also allowed farmers to grow food for the country - and farmers I spoke to pointed out that they face tough financial choices.\n\nThough there have been government subsidies in place for years, meaning farmers are paid by the government to support wildlife on their land, since Brexit the way these grants are paid has changed, with different schemes designed in each of the devolved nations.\n\nIn England, there has been frustration in some quarters about the speed and rollout of the grants and the fact that some schemes have been paused -  such as the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) , though this is due to reopen, while others extended at the last minute, leaving farmers less able to plan ahead.\n\nSpeaking about the SFI scheme, a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson told the BBC: \"We inherited farming schemes which were untargeted and underspent, meaning millions of pounds were not going to farming businesses.\n\n\"We have changed direction to ensure public money is spent effectively, and last year all the government's farming budget was spent.\"\n\nThey also acknowledged that wildflowers are vital, providing food and habitats for pollinators and wildlife, as well as improving biodiversity, and added: \"We are backing farmers with the largest nature-friendly budget in history and under our agri-environment schemes we are funding millions of hectares of wildflower meadows.\"\n\nAs part of its new deal for farmers, Defra said it has committed nearly £250m in farming grants to improve productivity, trial new technologies and drive innovation in the sector.\n\nMark Meadows, Warwickshire chair of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), maintains 6m (20ft) wildflower strips around many of his fields. He feared that without an extension to his current agreement with Defra he'd have to return some wildflower margins to crop production.\n\n\"I'd love [to] be profitable enough [to] say 'Look, we'll leave 5% of our farmland,'… but agricultural costs have gone up a lot,\" he says.\n\nOther farmers share similar tales. David Lord is a third-generation farmer in Essex and member of the Nature Friendly Farming Network.\n\n\"I'm 47 and I've never known farming to be under so much strain,\" he says.\n\nKnowing what funding for nature recovery on farms will be in place in future years is, he says, crucial. \"It takes time and care and cost to maintain [wildflowers]... A lot of farmers aren't going to be minded to just keep these habitats in place without the funding.\"\n\nThere are some glimmers of hope.\n\nProf Potts says there has at least been a slowdown in decline over the last couple of decades - and perhaps a limited recovery for some species.\n\n\"I think [this] reflects some of the agricultural practices that have been a bit more nature-friendly.\"\n\nNature writer, and author of Flora Britannica, Richard Mabey, agrees that the decline in wildflowers is far from universal.\n\nCertain species such as cow parsley, yarrow and knapweed are in fact spreading, and he welcomes an influx of non-native plants and \"garden escapes\", such as snowdrop and buddleia.\n\nEven so, Prof Potts says: \"It is the most precious things that we're losing the most of.\" This includes cornflowers, corncockle and corn marigold - what he terms the iconic British countryside flowers.\n\nAnd the overall decline is why my husband and I decided to create our own wildflower meadow from an overgrown arable field.\n\nThere was a field next to our house, which I had put beehives in, with permission from the owner. I had often thought it would be wonderful to create a wildflower meadow around those hives, so when the opportunity arose to buy the field, we decided to go ahead.\n\nA conservation specialist advised us on where to buy the seed. It was particularly important to get some yellow rattle seed, which helps keep more dominant grasses in check. This in turn gives other wildflowers more opportunity to gain a foothold.\n\nOur first year after sowing was amazing. A patriotic bloom of red, white and blue burst across the field. The red was from poppies which came from the disturbed ground. The white was ox-eye daisies, bladder campion and wild carrot, with spires of bright blue from viper's bugloss.\n\nThe colour has changed over time - the splash of red did not return, but different wildflowers arrived in their place.\n\nThe most spectacular year was last summer. Orchid seeds I'd scattered many years before and almost forgotten about, managed to flower. We counted more than 100 bee orchids — which to a bee lover like me, was the climax of years of work.\n\nIn fairness, I should admit it's years of my husband Chris's work. He found an old-fashioned seed fiddle for us to use — a hand-held device used to scatter the seeds in a controlled way, operated as though drawing a bow across a violin.\n\nHe also cut the hay at the end of summer, initially trying with a scythe - Poldark-style - but ultimately finding a small tractor does the trick in a less backbreaking way.\n\nOf course, many people are not in the fortunate position we found ourselves in, of being able to create a wildflower meadow. And in the UK, you cannot plant wildflowers just anywhere — you would most likely need the landowner's permission.\n\nBut growing numbers of people are trying to create their own patches of wildflowers. Plantlife reports that more and more are joining its No Mow May initiative —  an annual campaign to let wildflowers grow freely, by packing away the lawnmower.\n\nSarah Shuttleworth says just a small spot can make a difference, especially when it comes to pollinators. \"Anyone who has a patch of grass could do their bit… the idea is that you're recreating a meadow-type management scheme, but in a very, very micro scale.\"\n\nThe charity would like to see wildflower habitats being given the same kind of protection as other precious landscapes. Meanwhile Prof Potts thinks, \"We need a bit more of a radical think about how to support farmers to do the right thing.\"\n\nNew housing developments could also prove a way to create wildflower meadows. Under the government's Biodiversity Net Gain scheme, set up under the Environment Act, developers creating building sites are obliged to ensure the same amount of biodiversity at the end of the project, as they had at the start, plus 10%.\n\nBen Taylor manages the Iford Estate, farming land near Lewes in Sussex. For a recording of Open Country on Radio 4, he showed me with great pride around a new wildflower meadow, which was part of a 90-acre site, funded as a pilot by the scheme.\n\n\"We have seen hares here now, which we never had a year or two ago, before we started doing this. So it's really exciting...\"\n\nBut, I wondered, does it make sense to take all of those acres of land out of food production?\n\nMr Taylor says the soil was poor there anyway. \"You have to have nature to be able to grow food,\" he adds. \"Because you need the pollinators as you need the ecosystem, the food chains, the soil webs and everything else to be able to grow food sustainably in the long-term - so I like to think of it as a reservoir of biodiversity.\"\n\nMany ecologists also want us to look beyond the benefits the wildflowers provide for us.\n\n\"Those species are just valuable in their own right, regardless of what they do or what they provide… They've also got their own right to be,\" argues Dr Kelly Hemmings, associate professor in ecology at the Royal Agricultural University.\n\nRichard Mabey stresses a similar point. \"They are important, in my view, for ethical reasons, simply because they exist.\n\n\"Beyond that they are the infrastructure of all other life on the Earth, the fundamental base of the food chain.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

a country they can't remember\n\nShirley Chung was just a year old when she was adopted by a US family in 1966.\n\nBorn in South Korea, her birthfather was a member of the American military, who returned home soon after Shirley was born. Unable to cope, her birth mother placed her in an orphanage in the South Korean capital, Seoul.\n\n\"He abandoned us, is the nicest way I can put it,\" says Shirley, now 61.\n\nAfter around a year, Shirley was adopted by a US couple, who took her back to Texas.\n\nShirley grew up living a life similar to that of many young Americans. She went to school, got her driving licence and worked as a bartender.\n\n\"I moved and breathed and got in trouble like many teenage Americans of the 80s. I'm a child of the 80s,\" Shirley says.\n\nShirley had children, got married and became a piano teacher. Life carried on for decades with no reason to doubt her American identity.\n\nBut then in 2012, her world came crashing down.\n\nShe lost her Social Security card and needed a replacement. But when she went to her local Social Security office, Shirley was told she needed to prove her status in the country. Eventually she found out she did not have US citizenship.\n\n\"I had a little mental breakdown after finding out I wasn't a citizen,\" she says.\n\nShirley is not alone. Estimates of how many American adoptees lack citizenship  range from 18,000 to 75,000 . Some intercountry adoptees may not even know they lack US citizenship.\n\nDozens of adoptees have been deported to their countries of birth in recent years, according to the Adoptee Rights Law Center. A man born in South Korea and adopted as a child by an American family - only to be deported to his country of birth because of a criminal record - took his own life in 2017.\n\nThe reasons why so many US adoptees do not have citizenship are varied. Shirley blames her parents for failing to finalise the correct paperwork when she came to the US. She also blames the school system and the government for not highlighting that she did not have citizenship.\n\n\"I blame all the adults in my life that literally just dropped the ball and said: 'She's here in America now, she's going to be fine.'\"\n\n\"Well, am I? Am I going to be fine?\"\n\nAnother woman, who requested anonymity for fear of attracting the attention of authorities, was adopted by an American couple from Iran in 1973 when she was two years old.\n\nGrowing up in the US Midwest, she encountered some racism but generally had a happy upbringing.\n\n\"I settled into my life, always understanding that I was an American citizen. That's what I was told. I still believe that today,\" she says.\n\nBut that changed when she tried to get a passport at the age of 38 and discovered immigration authorities had lost critical documents that supported her claim to citizenship.\n\nThis has further complicated her feelings surrounding identity.\n\n\"I personally don't categorise myself as an immigrant. I didn't come here as an immigrant with a second language, a different culture, family members, ties to a country that I was born in… my culture was erased,\" she says.\n\n\"You are told that you have these rights as an American - to vote and to participate in democracy, to work, to go to school, to raise your family, to have freedoms - all these things that Americans have.\n\n\"And then all of a sudden they started pushing us into a category of immigrants, simply because they cut us from legislation. We should have all equally had citizenship rights because that was promised through adoption policies.\"\n\nFor decades, intercountry adoptions approved by courts and government agencies did not automatically guarantee US citizenship. Adoptive parents sometimes failed to secure legal status or naturalised citizenship for their children.\n\nThe Child Citizenship Act of 2000 made some headway in rectifying this, granting automatic citizenship to international adoptees. But the law only covered future adoptees or those born after February 1983. Those who arrived before then were not granted citizenship, leaving tens of thousands in limbo.\n\nAdvocates have been pushing for Congress to remove the age cut-off but these bills have failed to make it past the House.\n\nSome, like Debbie Principe, whose two adopted children have special needs, have spent decades trying to secure citizenship for their dependents.\n\nShe adopted two children from an orphanage in Romania in the 1990s after watching them on Shame of a Nation - a documentary about the neglect of children in orphanages following the 1989 Romanian Revolution, that sent shockwaves around the world when it aired.\n\nThe most recent rejection of citizenship came in May, and was followed by a notice stating that if the decision was not appealed in 30 days, she would have to turn in her daughter to Homeland Security, she said.\n\n\"We'll just be lucky if they don't get picked up and deported to another country that isn't even their country of origin,\" Ms Principe said.\n\nThose fears for adoptees and their families have risen even further since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a vow to remove \"promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of federal law\".\n\nLast month, the Trump administration said \"two million illegal aliens have left the United States in less than 250 days, including an estimated 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and more than 400,000 deportations\".\n\nWhile many Americans support deportations of illegal migrants, there has been uproar over some incidents.\n\nIn one case, 238 Venezuelans were deported by the US to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. They were accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang  despite most of them having no criminal records.\n\nLast month, US officials detained 475 people - more than 300 of them South Korean nationals - who they said were working illegally at Hyundai's battery facility, one of the largest foreign investment projects in Georgia.  The workers were taken away in handcuffs and chains to be detained , sparking outrage in their home country.\n\nAdoptee rights groups say they have been flooded with requests for help since Trump's return and some adoptees have gone into hiding.\n\n\"When the election results came in, it started to really cascade with requests for help,\" said Greg Luce, an attorney and founder of the Adoptee Rights Law Center, adding he's had more than 275 requests for help.\n\nThe adoptee who arrived from Iran in the 1970s said she has started avoiding certain areas, like her local Iranian supermarket, and shares an app with her friends so they always have access to her location, in case she is \"swept up\".\n\n\"At the end of the day, they don't care about your back story. They don't care that you're legally here and it's just a paperwork error. I always tell people this one single piece of paper has essentially just ruined my life,\" she said.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned right now, I feel stateless.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite adoptees being left in limbo for decades, Emily Howe, a civil and human rights attorney who has worked with adoptees across the US, believes it is just a case of political will that should unite people from across the political spectrum.\n\n\"It should be a straightforward fix: adopted children should be equal to their biological siblings of parents who were US citizens at the time of birth,\" Ms Howe said.\n\n\"The applicants have two, three, or four US citizen parents, and are now in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. We're talking about babies and toddlers who were shipped overseas through no fault of their own and lawfully admitted under US policy,\" she added.\n\n\"These are people who literally were promised that they were going to be Americans when they were two years old.\"\n\nShirley wishes she could get the US president into a room, so she and others like her could explain their stories.\n\n\"I would ask him to please have some compassion. We're not illegal aliens,\" she said.\n\n\"We were put on planes as little itty-bitty babies. Just please hear our story and please follow through with the promise that America gave each one of the babies that got on those planes: American citizenship.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxn00l00r6o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:45:26.515+00:00","title":"Does Trump's nuclear testing raise the stakes - or are we already in an arms race?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has announced the United States will begin testing nuclear weapons, raising global fears of a new nuclear arms race.

testing raise the stakes - or are we already in an arms race?\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced the US will start testing nuclear weapons in what could be a radical shift in his nation's policy.\n\n\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, as he was about to meet the Chinese president  on Thursday.\n\n\"That process will begin immediately.\"\n\nThe world's nuclear-armed states - those acknowledged as belonging to the so-called nuclear club and those whose status is more ambiguous - regularly test their nuclear weapons' delivery systems, such as a missile that would carry a nuclear warhead.\n\nOnly North Korea has actually tested a nuclear weapon since the 1990s - and it has not done so since 2017.\n\nThe White House has not issued any clarifications to the commander-in-chief's announcement. So it remains unclear whether Trump means testing nuclear delivery systems or the destructive weapons themselves. In comments after his post, he said nuclear test sites would be determined later.\n\nMany of the six policy experts who spoke to the BBC said that testing nuclear weapons could raise the stakes in an already dangerous moment where all signs showed the world was heading in the direction of a nuclear arms race - even though it has not yet begun.\n\nOne of the six did not agree that Trump's comments would have a major impact - and another did not think the US was provoking a race - but all said the world faced a rising nuclear threat.\n\n\"The concern here is that, because nuclear armed states have not conducted these nuclear tests in decades - setting North Korea aside - this could create a domino effect,\" said Jamie Kwong, fellow in the nuclear policy programme at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"We're at a very concerning moment where the US, Russia and China are potentially entering this moment that could very well become an arms race.\"\n\nDarya Dolzikova, Senior Research Fellow for Proliferation and Nuclear Policy at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) - a London-based defence and security think tank - said she did not believe Trump's comments would change the situation massively.\n\nBut, she added, \"there are other dynamics globally that have raised the risks of nuclear exchange and further proliferation of nuclear weapons to levels higher than they have been in decades\".\n\nTrump's message,  she said, \"is a drop in a much larger bucket, and there are some legitimate concerns of that bucket overfilling\".\n\nThe experts pointed to escalating conflicts where one or more of the warring parties is a nuclear power - the war in Ukraine, for instance, in  which Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened at times  that he could use nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd then there were flare-ups - if not full-fledged conflicts - such as the one between Pakistan and India this year, or Israel - which has a policy of neither confirming nor denying it has nuclear weapons - attacking Iran - a country the West accuses of trying to build nuclear weapons (a charge Tehran denies).\n\nTensions on the Korean peninsula and China's ambitions in Taiwan add to the overall picture.\n\nThe last existing nuclear treaty between the US and Russia that limits their amounts of deployed nuclear arsenals - warheads ready to go - is set to expire in February next year.\n\nIn his announcement, Trump said the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country - a statement that does not match figures updated regularly by another think tank that specialises in the field, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).\n\nAccording to Sipri, Russia has 5,459 nuclear warheads followed by the US with 5,177, and China coming a distant third with 600.\n\nOther think tanks reported similar numbers.\n\nRussia announced recently it had tested new nuclear weapons delivery systems - including a missile the Kremlin said could penetrate US defences and another that could go underwater to strike the US coast.\n\nThe latter claim may have led to Trump's announcement, some of the experts suspected, even though Russia said its tests \"were not nuclear\".\n\nMeanwhile, the US has been watching China closely - with increasing concern that it will reach near-peer status, too, and posing a \"two-peer nuclear risk\", experts said.\n\nSo a resumption of US nuclear testing could prompt China and Russia to do the same.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman said that \"if someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly\".\n\nIn its response, China said it hoped the US would fulfil its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty - which both countries have signed but not ratified - and honour its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\n\nDaryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said a US resumption of nuclear weapons testing would be \"a mistake of historic international security proportions\".\n\nHe said the risk of nuclear conflict \"has been steadily rising\" over several years and, unless the US and Russia \"negotiate some form of new constraints on their arsenals, we're likely going to see an unconstained, dangerous, three-way arms race between the US, Russia and then China in the coming years\".\n\nHans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said the average person should be \"very concerned\" because there has been an increase over the past five years in nuclear warheads for the first time since the Cold War.\n\nThe last US nuclear weapons test - underground in Nevada - was in 1992.\n\nKimball said it would take at least 36 months to get the Nevada site ready for use again.\n\nThe US currently uses computer simulations and other non-explosive means to test its nuclear weapons, and therefore does not have a practical justification to detonate them, multiple experts said.\n\nKwong said there were inherent risks even with underground testing, because you must ensure there is not a radioactive leak above ground and it does not affect groundwater.\n\nWhile blaming Russia and China for ratcheting up the rhetoric, Robert Peters, senior research fellow of strategic deterrence at the conservative Heritage Foundation,  said that, while there may not be a scientific or technical reason for testing a warhead, \"the primary reason is to send a political message for your opponents\".\n\n\"It may be necessary for some president, whether it's Donald Trump or whomever, to test nuclear weapons as a demonstration of credibility\", he said, arguing it was \"not an unreasonable position to hold\" to be prepared to test.\n\nWhile many others the BBC spoke to disagreed, all offered a fairly dire assessment of the current situation.\n\n\"My sense is that, if the new nuclear arms race hasn't already begun, then we're currently heading towards the starting line,\" said Rhys Crilley, who writes on the subject at the University of Glasgow.\n\n\"I worry every day about the risks of a nuclear arms race and the increasing risk of nuclear war.\"\n\nThe US tested the first atomic bomb in July 1945 in the desert at Alamogordo, New Mexico.\n\nIt later became the only country in the world to use nuclear weapons in warfare after dropping two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of the same year during World War Two."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/trump-nuclear-testing-cold-war.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:12:41-04:00","title":"Trump’s Call to Resume Nuclear Testing After Decades Revives a Cold War Debate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would resume nuclear explosive testing, claiming it is necessary in response to other nations conducting tests.

That age supposedly ended with the arrival of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that nations agreed to in the mid-1990s. But not enough of the signatories ratified it for the treaty to formally come into force. Its objective was to starve the arms race by cutting off new tests and the cycle of retaliation they engendered.\n\nMr. Trump has now revived the debate inside the national security community over whether to break the tradition of observing that treaty, which some of his former aides have argued impedes the country’s ability to demonstrate “peace through strength.” On Air Force One, returning from Korea, the president told reporters he had made the call because of all the other countries conducting nuclear tests.\n\n“We’ve halted it years — many years — ago,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the fact that the last U.S. explosive test of a nuclear weapon was in 1992, during the George H.W. Bush administration. “But with others doing testing, I think it is appropriate that we do also.”\n\nExcept, of course, they aren’t. The only nation that has been regularly testing in the past quarter century is North Korea, and its last explosive test was in September 2017.\n\nMoscow has not conducted a test in 35 years, in the last days of the Soviet Union. Mr. Trump, however, may have been confusing nuclear weapons tests with Russia’s recent declaration that it had tested two exotic delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons: a nuclear-powered cruise missile and an undersea torpedo, called Poseidon, that could cross the Pacific and strike the West Coast of the United States. Both are designed to evade American missile defenses, which look for the warheads of intercontinental ballistic missiles as they speed through space.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters that he was not including China on that list of testing nations; its last explosive test was 29 years ago, though there is some evidence the country has made preparations at Lop Nur, where Mao first demonstrated China’s nuclear capabilities in the 1960s, in case it decides to resume.\n\nMr. Trump’s own senior official in charge of nuclear testing — Brandon Williams, a former one-term member of Congress from upstate New York — was asked point-blank during his confirmation hearing in April whether the United States needed to go back to explosive testing.\n\n“I would not advise testing, and I think we should rely on the scientific information,” Mr. Williams said, referring to such things as data gathered from supercomputer modeling. But he quickly noted the decision would be made “above my pay grade.”\n\nApparently, that is exactly what happened. In the hour before Mr. Trump met Xi Jinping, China’s leader, in South Korea on Thursday, he sent out a social media post saying he had ordered the “Department of War,” as he calls the Defense Department, to resume tests “immediately.” His qualifier that the tests would occur “on an equal basis” with U.S. rivals left many national security officials scratching their heads. (It was also puzzling because the Energy Department, not the Pentagon, is responsible for testing.)\n\nMr. Trump provided no rationale for resuming the testing, other than his incorrect statement that others were doing the same. He boasted that “the United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” which is incorrect — Russia has more. (Many of the weapons in Russia’s arsenal are small battlefield weapons of the kind American officials worried in October 2022 would be used against Ukraine.)\n\nHe said China was a “distant third” in its capabilities. That is true, but they are also growing fast. The Pentagon estimated during the Biden administration that China would have 1,000 deployed weapons by 2030 and would hit rough parity with the United States and Russia in 2035.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance said that testing the nuclear arsenal was important to make sure it “actually functions properly.”\n\n“To be clear,” he said, “we know that it does work properly, but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.” He made no reference to testing “on an equal basis” with other nations.\n\nMany experts believe that if the United States resumes testing, it would essentially give permission to other nations to do the same — roughly 100 days before the last arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, limiting the size of their arsenals, is set to expire.\n\nNuclear experts say that both Russia and China are prepared to conduct nuclear detonations at their underground test sites fairly rapidly. That is in contrast to the United States, which is seen as having made few serious preparations. Its test site is a desolate expanse of the Nevada desert bigger than the state of Rhode Island.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump’s first term, he revived the possibility of new American testing. In addition to discussing a restart of underground detonations, officials called for major reductions in the preparation time for a U.S. nuclear test resumption. The federal agency in charge of the nation’s nuclear test site ordered the required time for preparations to drop from years to as few as six months.\n\nNuclear experts saw the goal as unrealistic because testing equipment at the sprawling Nevada site had fallen into disrepair, or vanished.\n\nEven so, Project 2025, the 2023 right-wing blueprint for Mr. Trump’s presidency, echoed the push for a quickening. It called on Washington to forego the lengthy period of preparation altogether and “move to immediate test readiness” in order to give the president “maximum flexibility in responding to adversary actions.”\n\nThe drumbeat continued in 2024 when Robert C. O’Brien, a former national security adviser to Mr. Trump, said in Foreign Affairs that Washington “must test new nuclear weapons for reliability and safety in the real world.” But his core argument seemed less about a scientific need for explosive testing than about a political one — to demonstrate to rising and aggressive powers that the United States, which opened the nuclear age when it dropped two atomic weapons on Japan, remained prepared to use the ultimate weapon.\n\nCritics say a testing restart would incite a global arms race. They note that directors of the national labs in charge of the nation’s atomic arsenal have repeatedly testified to Congress that the United States did not need to return to nuclear detonations.\n\nIn lieu of testing, the United States now relies on top experts and machines at the nation’s weapons labs to verify the lethality of the country’s arsenal. Today the machines include room-size supercomputers, the world’s most powerful X-ray machine and a system of lasers the size of a sports stadium. No other country has such an extensive array of nonnuclear testing tools.\n\nIn contrast to laboratory studies, nuclear testing underground in explosive detonations lets scientists uncover major flaws in prototype arms and fine-tune new weapon designs. During the Cold War, China conducted 45 test explosions at Lop Nur, its underground test site in the Western desert. In comparison, France set off 210, Russia 715 and the United States 1,030.\n\nSuch tests slowly concluded at the end of the Cold War. In 1996, the stoppage was formalized in the global test ban. The world’s atomic powers signed it as a way to curb a costly nuclear arms race that was spinning out of control. But it has been an essentially voluntary agreement, since the U.S. Senate never ratified it, and other countries held back formal approval as well.\n\nSiegfried S. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico, where the first atomic bomb was created, has long argued that the test ban favors Washington because it bars pact-abiding rivals from catching up on the huge edge the United States possesses in advanced nuclear arms.\n\n“Yes, we can learn things by nuclear testing,” Dr. Hecker said in an interview. “But when you look at the big picture, we have much more to lose by going back to testing than we have to gain.”\n\nThe test disparities give Washington a military edge because they keep other powers from making their arsenals more diverse and deadly.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/china-trump-trade-security-chips-minerals.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:07:05-04:00","title":"With China Truce, U.S. National Security Controls Now Appear Up for Negotiation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent meeting in South Korea, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a series of concessions that appear to reverse prior aggressive trade and technology policies.

China said it would suspend the rollout of rare earths restrictions introduced in October, and return to buying U.S. soybeans, in addition to a newer promise to crack down on shipments of chemicals used to make fentanyl.\n\nBut one of the reversals from the United States was more notable in the precedent it set. The Trump administration agreed to pause for one year a rule that expanded the number of Chinese companies restricted from access to advanced technology. The rule, issued just four weeks ago, extended the reach of the “entity list,” a kind of trade blacklist for foreign companies that pose a national security threat.\n\nFormer officials and analysts said Thursday that the move appeared to be one of the first concessions the United States had made on national security-related technology controls as part of a trade negotiation. They called it a potential breakthrough for the Chinese side, which has long pushed to negotiate with the United States over these types of measures, known as export controls.\n\nChristopher Padilla, who served as an export control official in the George W. Bush administration, said it was a significant shift for U.S. policy. Chinese officials have consistently asked in talks with many presidential administrations for export control measures to be rolled back, he said.\n\n“We all had the talking points,” Mr. Padilla said. “The first one is: ‘That’s a national security issue, and we’re not going to discuss it in a trade negotiation.’”\n\n“Export controls have now become a tradable item in the relationship,” Mr. Padilla added. “You’ve discarded decades of precedent.”\n\nBrett Fetterly, a principal at the Asia Group consultancy and the former national security adviser to Ben Sasse, the Republican former senator, agreed that Beijing had succeeded in this summit in its long-term goal of tying national security-focused export controls to broader trade negotiations.\n\n“Technology competition now defines the U.S.-China relationship, and on this point President Xi secured key U.S. concessions,” Mr. Fetterly said.\n\nMany business groups praised a return to greater stability in the U.S.-China relationship, which would help encourage trade and growth. But some analysts said the Trump administration may have had little choice but to roll back U.S. technology controls given China’s chokehold on critical minerals. Last December, Beijing introduced its first curbs on rare earth mineral exports, which it expanded in April and again in October in response to Mr. Trump’s trade war.\n\nChina dominates the mining and processing of rare earth minerals, and the magnets made from them that are common in batteries and motors. The Chinese curbs threatened the supply chains of global makers of cars, planes, munitions and semiconductors, and some companies were forced to halt production lines. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, had called the restrictions “a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world.”\n\nWith the renewed tensions with China this fall, industry executives say supplies of minerals and magnets have once again been running short.\n\nSome analysts say that China’s decision to limit exports of rare earths was a natural consequence of Washington’s technology controls, which used a similar global licensing system to limit China’s access to advanced chips. After so many years of being the target of restrictions, China sought to develop powerful controls of its own, they say.\n\nEmily Benson, the head of strategy at Minerva Technology Futures, a consultancy, said it was “sort of surprising” that the United States didn’t seem to anticipate that other countries would develop similar systems. She added, “It was just a matter of time.”\n\nOther have pointed fingers at the Trump administration’s behavior toward China. They say it was Mr. Trump’s aggressive threats of tariffs this spring that gave the Chinese the opportunity to try out their new approach, and the administration’s lack of a coherent strategy that gave the Chinese an opening to press for long-desired changes.\n\nSome have pointed to the waning influence of the National Security Council, which would typically coordinate strategy and policies on China. The N.S.C.’s influence has been greatly reduced in the Trump administration, after multiple officials were fired for suspicions of political disloyalty.\n\nVarious U.S. departments have sometimes appeared uncoordinated in their measures against China this year. And Chinese actions in response have seemed designed to telegraph the message that any measures taken by the United States to clamp down on China will now be aggressively matched by Beijing.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump introduced high tariffs in April and China put in place its rare earth curbs, the two countries reached a tentative truce in Geneva in May. But the day after that meeting, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued new guidance saying that the use of A.I. chips made by Chinese tech firm Huawei anywhere in the world was an export control violation. The announcement rankled China and led it to clamp down on rare earth exports again.\n\nThe countries held a series of meetings in other European capitals this summer to try to stabilize the relationship. But shortly after a phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi in September, the United States released its rule extending the impact of the entity list to majority-owned subsidiaries, and the Chinese once again responded angrily. In October, Beijing imposed expansive global controls on the trade in minerals and products made with them.\n\nChinese officials claimed that U.S. measures like the 50 percent entity list rule had violated a consensus struck in their bilateral meetings. Some U.S. officials privately grumbled about the Commerce Department’s timing and lack of coordination. But publicly, the United States insisted it had not made promises to withhold the imposition of export controls.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC last week, Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said that the Chinese were “trying out a lot of different narratives when the reality is, they just want to exert economic control on the world.”\n\n“They’re using anything else that has happened as a pretext,” he said. He added that the United States had promised to reduce its tariffs in return for China allowing the free flow of rare earths. “We kept that promise, and they have not kept theirs.”\n\nWith the president’s meeting with Mr. Xi, the U.S. side appears to have made more explicit concessions. A White House spokesman confirmed Thursday that the United States had agreed to pause the expansion of the entity list to cover majority-owned subsidiaries for one year.\n\nFor some, the move is welcome. Some tech executives and lobbyists had criticized the 50 percent rule, saying the due diligence it requires is onerous or impossible.\n\nSean Stein, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies doing business in China, said in a statement that the 50 percent rule’s reversal, and Beijing’s decision to pause its October rare earth controls, was “especially welcome news.” He also called the broader trade announcement “very encouraging.”\n\n“America’s reduction of the fentanyl-related tariffs and China’s commitment to take strong action to curb fentanyl precursors have paved the way for a reopening of China’s market for U.S. agriculture and energy and a wider, mutually beneficial trade agreement,” Mr. Stein said.\n\nThe 50 percent rule greatly expanded the reach of the entity list, freezing trade for some companies. According to Wirescreen, a data platform focused on China, the rule means that the entity list has grown from roughly 1,300 China-related parties to more than 20,000.\n\nPeople familiar with the situation said that the Commerce Department had described the change to others in the administration as correcting a loophole, and that officials in the Treasury Department and elsewhere had been surprised by the ultimate impact of the policy.\n\nSome U.S. officials and analysts argue the change has been needed to stop targets of the entity list from easily sidestepping the impact of U.S. sanctions by shifting business to their subsidiaries instead. Mr. Padilla said the standard was used for other government sanctions lists, like controls on military hardware administered by the State Department and financial sanctions administered by the Treasury Department.\n\n“If you’re going to sanction a company but you don’t at the same time sanction majority-owned subsidiaries, that doesn’t make a lot of sense,” he said. “From a practical point of view, this was a loophole that needed to be closed.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/world/africa/sudan-el-fasher-atrocities-executions-video.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:22:38-04:00","title":"Executions and Mass Casualties: Videos Show Horror Unfolding in Sudan","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, a wave of graphic videos and eyewitness accounts has exposed severe human rights violations in El Fasher, Sudan, where the Rapid Support Forces (R.S.F.) have captured the city after an 18-month siege.

Sudan\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T18:22:38-04:00\n\nWith dozens of bodies scattered around him, against a backdrop of burning vehicles, a sole survivor begged for his life.\n\nA Sudanese paramilitary commander known as Abu Lulu leaned over the man, listening to his desperate pleas. But he had little time for them.\n\nStanding up, Abu Lulu ignored the man’s imprecations, casually shot him dead, and kept walking.\n\nThe execution, depicted in a video circulating online and verified by The New York Times, was one of numerous scenes of violence to emerge from the besieged Sudanese city of El Fasher since it was captured by paramilitaries last weekend.\n\nVideos and witness accounts show trenches filled with bodies, and fighters with the paramilitary force — the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F. — hunting down civilians as they flee.\n\nThe images of these and other atrocities have set off global outrage and stoked fears that the region of Darfur is plunging, once again, into a cycle of genocidal violence of the kind that made the Sudanese region a focus of global politics two decades ago.\n\nAt the United Nations and in Western capitals, officials issued statements on Thursday condemning the R.S.F., which has been battling Sudan’s military since the country plunged into a ruinous civil war over two years ago, and recently declared its own parallel government.\n\nSome called for punitive measures against its main foreign backer, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn Washington, congressional leaders renewed calls for a pause on arms sales to the Emirates until it stops arming the paramilitary. In London, the government faced questions about reports that British-made military equipment was being used by the R.S.F.\n\nAt an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, Tom Fletcher, the top U.N. humanitarian official, criticized member states for letting the crisis reach this point.\n\n“I have found the limits of my ability and the U.N.’s authority,” he said, calling on member states to “stop arming” the R.S.F.’s campaign, without naming the country responsible, widely assumed to be the Emirates. (The Emirates has denied backing either side in the conflict.)\n\nResponding to mounting outrage, the R.S.F. leader, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, made a speech shared on social media in which he conceded that his troops had committed some abuses, and pledged to hold responsible “any soldier or officer who committed a crime.”\n\nThe R.S.F. later said it had arrested Abu Lulu, the commander who had been filmed shooting the injured man.\n\nBut the paramilitary denied a shocking allegation from the World Health Organization, which said that 460 people had been killed at a hospital in El Fasher on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough the W.H.O. did not specify who had carried out the killings, they had occurred days after the R.S.F. seized El Fasher, breaking an 18-month siege that reduced starving residents to eating animal feed.\n\nIn a statement, the R.S.F. said it “categorically denied” those allegations, which it said were part of an “intensive propaganda campaign” with “no connection to reality.” On Thursday, the group released a video purporting to show the hospital, saying it countered claims of the attack. In the footage, not many patients can be seen in the disheveled building.\n\nMr. Fletcher’s remarks added to a pile of U.N. reports over the past 18 months about what is widely considered to be the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis — a civil war that has forced 12 million people from their homes, spread famine across the country and killed as many as 400,000 people, by some estimates.\n\nThat crisis has only intensified in El Fasher in recent days. Communications with the city were still largely cut off on Thursday. But a stream of videos, filmed by R.S.F. fighters themselves and verified by The Times and the Centre for Information Resilience, a nonprofit that documents potential war crimes, opened a window into the unfolding carnage.\n\nIn one video, fighters stepped over bodies scattered in a room in the city’s university. A survivor can be seen raising an arm, apparently calling for help, before a fighter shoots him dead.\n\nAn estimated 260,000 civilians were trapped in the city when R.S.F. troops captured the main army base on Sunday. Since then, thousands have fled. But aid groups said Thursday that only a trickle appeared to have made it to safety, and many of those who did reported passing down a road littered with the bodies of others who had died, or been killed, along the way.\n\nJust 5,000 people had reached Tawila, about 40 miles west of El Fasher, said Mathilde Vu of the Norwegian Refugee Council, which provides aid there. “People who arrived talk about dead bodies on the road and being stopped multiple times before reaching,” she said. “Men are being separated and detained.”\n\nThe journey, the group said in a statement on Thursday, is riddled with “extortion, arbitrary arrests, detention, looting, sexual violence and harassment.”\n\nThose who survive the trip are directed to overflowing camps that already hold hundreds of thousands of people, where disease outbreaks are common and there is an extreme shortage of food, water and shelters.\n\n“They are safe from shelling and attacks, but not from the suffering,” Ms. Vu said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/orlando-air-traffic-control-airports-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"22:12:15-04:00","title":"Air Controller Shortage Causes Delays in Orlando and at Other Major Airports","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Air traffic controller shortages, intensified by a government shutdown and pre-existing staffing gaps, caused major disruptions at key U.S. airports including Orlando International Airport, John F.

That provided an opening for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to claim it.\n\nAs Mr. Hegseth settled into the home, which an Army history notes is guarded by two Revolutionary War-era cannons, other Trump officials also took up residence at housing built and designed for senior admirals and generals in the Washington area.\n\nA handful of White House officials have lived in military housing in the past, but it appears to be unusual for several cabinet members and other officials to move into military quarters in such a short amount of time.\n\nThree former residents of Quarters 8 expressed frustration that a senior officer was not living at the home, which they said would cause a ripple effect and make it more difficult for admirals and generals posted in the area to find affordable housing.\n\n“It’s a great place,” said retired Army Gen. Dennis J. Reimer, who lived in Quarters 8 when he served as the Army’s vice chief of staff in the early 1990s. “It’s like one out of the movies — you have that spiral staircase and you’re right over a riverbank.”\n\nThe trend of Trump administration officials taking over military residences in the region was reported earlier by The Atlantic.\n\nSoon after he was sworn in as secretary of state, Marco Rubio moved in a couple doors down from his Pentagon counterpart. Mr. Rubio lives there mostly alone; his family has opted to stay in Florida, according to a State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, lives in “a government representation facility” owned by the Coast Guard and is “paying fair market rent,” according to Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman.\n\nDaniel P. Driscoll, the Army secretary, has also moved into military housing, as has the Navy secretary, John Phelan, whose home in Washington was damaged in a fire in May, according to a congressional staff member who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump’s first term, only Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, were known to have lived for a time in military housing.\n\nThere is precedent for an elected official to take over military quarters. In 1974, Congress authorized the vice president to reside at the Naval Observatory, which for 40 years had been the official home of the chief of naval operations. (Since then, the Navy’s top admirals have typically lived in Tingey House, a historic property across town at the Washington Navy Yard.)\n\nAt McNair, the Army vice chief of staff’s residence at Quarters 8 sits in the middle of a row of 15 military homes that have long been assigned to the three-star generals on the Army’s senior staff at the Pentagon, as well as a number of generals commanding the post-Sept. 11 wars.\n\nAccording to a Defense Department official, Mr. Hegseth is paying $4,655.70 per month to live there this year.\n\nGeneral Reimer said that the residence had a brass plaque noting that the Army’s 1980s recruiting slogan — “Be All That You Can Be” — came from one of its previous occupants, Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman. Quarters 8 also had a small gravesite in the yard, he said, where General Thurman buried his dog, who died while he lived there.\n\n“I think the dog’s name was something like Fido,” General Reimer recalled. “The dog’s grave had a marker saying ‘Here lies Fido. He was all he could be.’”\n\nWhen Robert M. Gates was chosen to be President George W. Bush’s defense secretary, he did not own a home in the Washington area. He asked for government housing and moved into an old home near the State Department. Known as Navy Hill and Potomac Annex, the 12-acre site has three residences for admirals.\n\nCongress authorized Mr. Gates to live in the house while paying rent to the Pentagon.\n\nMr. Gates’s successor, Leon Panetta, was offered his predecessor’s home at Navy Hill.\n\n“I went there and checked it out,” Mr. Panetta said in an interview. “But found out that it would cost probably about $3,000 a month.”\n\nWithout his wife joining him, he added, “I certainly would not be entertaining there, so it just didn’t make a lot of sense for me to take the house.”\n\nMr. Panetta took an apartment near Capitol Hill in the same townhouse he had lived in as the director of the C.I.A.\n\nDefense Department officials installed the secure communications lines he needed to discuss sensitive and classified information away from his office.\n\nSecurity guards stood watch outside, even when he was not home.\n\nIf there were increased threats against the senior members of the Trump administration, Mr. Panetta added, the federal government could build new housing for them.\n\nIt is unclear why so many Trump administration officials have sought to live on military bases, but Mr. Panetta and his successor, Chuck Hagel, said that they faced the same kinds of security threats that any defense secretary routinely receives, and felt secure in their homes with Defense Department bodyguards posted outside.\n\nFor national security reasons, it makes sense for three- and four-star generals to live at Fort McNair, which is a short drive away from the Pentagon, Mr. Panetta said.\n\n“Any time there’s an emergency they’ve got to be able to respond quickly to whatever crisis is taking place, so that’s important,” he said. “I think that was part of the reason for having that housing close by.”\n\nMr. Mattis lived in Mr. Gates’s former home at Navy Hill during the two years he served as defense secretary under Mr. Trump. But other Pentagon chiefs, including Chuck Hagel, Mark T. Esper and Lloyd J. Austin III, stayed in the homes they owned in the Washington area, and had similar secure communication rooms installed.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Hagel recalled that it took about three days to set up when he was sworn in, and just a day to remove when he left office.\n\nGovernment employees patched the drywall, repainted and moved on.\n\nHelene Cooper, Eric Schmitt and Michael Crowley contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/travel/hurricane-melissa-jamaica-resort.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:04:59-04:00","title":"‘Trees in Hot Tubs’: Riding Out Hurricane Melissa at a Beach Resort","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful storms ever to hit Jamaica, guests and staff at Beaches Negril, a Sandals resort on the west coast, demonstrated remarkable resilience.

grandson’s seventh birthday at Beaches Negril, an all-inclusive Sandals resort on Jamaica’s west coast, when Hurricane Melissa scrambled their plans.\n\nAs airports closed and airlines canceled flights over the weekend, Ms. Rampy, 54, a travel adviser from Fort Worth, realized they would not be flying home on Tuesday and would instead have to hunker down at their hotel and ride out the most powerful hurricane ever to hit Jamaica.\n\n“I understood the gravity of the situation,” she said.\n\nIn the days leading up to landfall, Ms. Rampy said, the staff at Beaches Negril held regular town-hall-style meetings about the coming hurricane but otherwise maintained a sense of normalcy.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the sky became increasingly overcast, and a few light showers signaled what was to come. After dinner that night, staff members encouraged guests to take food from the buffet back to their rooms just in case the staff couldn’t reach them the next day. The storm was forecast to make landfall either later that night or the next day.\n\nAs the next morning dawned and the worst winds and rains still had not arrived, some of the 130 staff members who had volunteered to ride out the storm with the guests delivered breakfast to each door, including eggs, bacon, French toast, waffles and orange juice — as the rain began to pelt sideways.\n\nMs. Rampy and her family had adjoining rooms that faced the beach beyond a water park and a playground, giving them a front-row seat as the hurricane approached.\n\nThe electricity flickered, Ms. Rampy said, but because the resort had a generator, they lost power for a total of only five to 10 seconds. In one room, they took a mattress off a trundle bed, laid it against a window and bolstered it with a bed frame. Ms. Rampy said her grandson had built a fort, where he watched a movie on a tablet as the storm arrived. The rest of the family followed the Weather Channel, read books, took naps and played cards while keeping an eye on the storm through the unblocked windows in the adjoining room.\n\nInternet service went out at around 1:30 p.m., during the worst of the storm. Branches were ripped off trees, palm trees bent over in the ferocious winds and rain continued to pour down. But with the room’s covered balcony blocking much of the wind, “we didn’t feel the imminent danger,” Ms. Rampy said. She was used to tornadoes back home in Texas, she added, but this was different.\n\n“While I think a tornado can do probably more damage, it’s very quick,” she said. “This was sustained for hours and hours of rain like you’ve never seen.”\n\nAfter the worst of the storm had passed, she said, staff members brought meat, fish, salads, potatoes, and rice and peas for dinner.\n\n“You never feel more like an entitled American as when you’re in a resort and you know that the people that are there caring for you are possibly losing their homes or they don’t know how their family is,” Ms. Rampy said. “And yet they’ve got on raincoats bringing you steak and chicken and fish for dinner.”\n\nBy 8:30 the next morning, guests and workers alike were outside picking up fallen branches and clearing debris. By about 10 a.m., one of the resort’s pools was open again, and guests were swimming.\n\n“It was almost like business as usual, except there are trees in hot tubs,” Ms. Rampy said.\n\nThe hurricane devastated parts of Jamaica, flooding streets, tearing off roofs and flattening buildings, particularly along its southwestern coast. Officials are still trying to assess the death toll. No guests or staff members were injured at any of Sandals’ eight resorts across Jamaica during the storm, Sandals said in a statement. The company is raising money for relief efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms. Rampy said, she finally broke down and allowed herself to feel all the fear and apprehension she had held back during the storm. “I very much understood that a Category 5 hurricane making landfall while we were on a resort on the beach could be catastrophic,” she said.\n\nMs. Rampy, whose travel agency works with Sandals, said she had been to Jamaica more than 50 times and already had a trip booked in December — one she still intends to take.\n\n“I cannot tell you enough about the resilience, the heart, the compassion, the care and the concern and the love that the Jamaican people have,” she said. “I will never stop coming to Jamaica.”\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

Louisiana\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T17:49:15-04:00\n\nEverything changed for Lisa Oglesbee in January, after a spinal condition left her husband in a wheelchair. Without his physical strength, she could not manage the job they had shared, cleaning commercial pizza ovens. And she could not look for another one yet, not when he needed her help to move around the house.\n\nWhen the government shut down on Oct. 1, she started to worry that his application for disability benefits would take even longer than they had been warned. Then, she began to hear that their federal food benefits — around $350 a month, she said — would not come in November.\n\n“I think they don’t care — it’s not them, it’s not their family,” Ms. Oglesbee, 42, said of lawmakers in Washington, holding back tears as she waited in line this week at a food pantry in Winnsboro, a small town in northeast Louisiana. “I hope I’m wrong about that.”\n\nWith nearly unanimous support from the Legislature, Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, said on Wednesday that the state would use about $147 million in emergency funds to keep food assistance flowing temporarily for  older residents, those who are disabled and households with children, starting Saturday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether or when the state’s intervention might be available to help other recipients. Mr. Landry said that thousands of “able-bodied” adults without young children would most likely need to turn to charity or, if unemployed, find jobs.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it would not disburse benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in November because of the shutdown, reversing its own policy that had allowed some funding to be reprogrammed during emergencies.\n\n“Without that, I don’t know how we would eat,” Ms. Oglesbee said of SNAP benefits. She added, “I didn’t realize how hard it was to get help, and I guess apparently, to keep help.”\n\nThe threat of food assistance disappearing for 42 million Americans, even for a month, has exposed how threadbare the nation’s social safety net has become at a time of persistent inflation and deep federal funding cuts. Filling the void in the coming weeks will strain many food banks and other organizations that were already stretched thin.\n\nLouisiana has one of the nation’s highest proportions of residents receiving SNAP, about one in five.\n\nThe crisis could be particularly acute in northeastern Louisiana. Nonprofit and social services groups say that poverty and hunger rates there are often higher than those in the rest of the state. Calls to 211, which connects people with social services, spiked by 40 percent this week in connection with the shutdown, according to the United Way of Northeast Louisiana.\n\n“You have a perfect storm happening even in the absence of this shutdown,” said Jan Moller, the executive director of Invest in Louisiana, a  policy research group. “When you add the uncertainty now created by the shutdown, you have a recipe for a real disaster.”\n\nAbout a dozen parishes, or counties, make up northeastern Louisiana, bounded by the Delta regions of Arkansas and Mississippi. Small, mostly rural communities are spread out over miles of farmland. Glimpses of rusting farm equipment, boarded-up windows and for-sale signs hint at how high prices and economic disinvestment have left many struggling to afford basic necessities.\n\nAshley Armstrong, a farmer in Bastrop, La., has been buffeted in recent months by rising equipment costs and canceled contracts stemming from federal cuts. But she has continued to offer a sizable discount to SNAP recipients who buy her produce, and to donate leftover produce to her church.\n\nOf federal lawmakers, she said, “I feel like they’re not really taking into consideration the everyday American and what these policy changes entail for their lives.”\n\nAt the Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana, leaders have begun to stagger distribution in anticipation of more need, and are competing to buy food to supplement donations. One pantry that works with the food bank took in nearly two dozen new applications for help in one morning this week.\n\n“We cannot fill the full gap and we know that,” said Jean Toth, the food bank’s executive director. Tears welling in her eyes, she added, “It’s emotional.”\n\nInflated prices mean that for some families, the monthly SNAP allocation — about $356 per household, on average — is barely enough to cover staples like bread, milk and canned goods. When word of the looming lapse began to spread last week via text messages and social media, many families had already used up their October benefits.\n\n“I run short at the end of the month,” said Jennifer Winn, 38, who estimated she gets around $1,100 in monthly SNAP benefits for herself and five children in Monroe and had gone without meals to ensure the children could eat.\n\nIn the coming weeks, she predicted, “It’s going be more chaotic because people are tired, they’re stressed and they’re crying out for help. And they don’t know where to get it from.”\n\nEven if families get their November benefits through state funding, it is unclear what would happen should the shutdown continue into December. Complicating matters, the shutdown may require some staff members in local offices that administer SNAP benefits to be furloughed in the coming days.\n\nMr. Landry, speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, blamed the shutdown on Democratic leaders in Congress, who have resisted agreeing to end it until Republicans agree to extend expiring health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans.\n\nBut in northeast Louisiana this week, most people interviewed pointed to what they saw as a broken system in Washington that felt deeply removed from their own day-to-day realities.\n\n“I feel that the government is making the poor people poorer, which I think is unfair,” said Demi Dyer, 33, who just moved with her family from Missouri to West Monroe, La.. She said she was worried that her SNAP application would take longer to be processed in her new state because of the shutdown. “We’re all human, we all struggle, we have all gone through stuff like this.”\n\nSome residents expressed frustration with President Trump’s unfulfilled promise to lower prices, as well as with assumptions that some of those dependent on food stamps had not been trying to find work.\n\n“I may have even been guilty in the past of the same, maybe, of looking at people — ‘Well, they need to get a job,’” Ms. Oglesbee said. “And some people do have jobs and still just don’t make enough money around.”\n\nSome residents of the region said they felt disillusioned to the point of not voting, because it didn’t seem to matter.\n\n“We need more people that care about folks,” said Dusty Ward, 39, who had been carefully rationing a month’s worth of food with his wife, Stephanie.\n\nAt Grace Place Ministries in Monroe, La., where dozens of people had lined up on a blustery cold morning for a hot meal, some grimly wondered whether the loss of a month’s benefits would drive the desperate to steal to stay fed. Prayer, for some, seemed like the only answer.\n\nOthers wondered if the lapse was a sign of the end times foretold in the Bible, or that all hope in government should be abandoned. Individuals and community groups that had stepped up before — after natural disasters, and during the pandemic — were preparing to do so again.\n\n“Maybe our country’s just hitting rock bottom in a way, and now it’s going to shift responsibility,” said Misty Loe, the executive director of Grace Place, comparing it to those who reach their lowest moment before improving. She was bustling around, slipping a box of cupcakes to toddlers who had come with their mother and overseeing new volunteers as they served hot dogs, fruit, salad and chips.\n\n“Ultimately, I do hope that the government goes back to stepping in where they need to — step in, step in and help feed,” Ms. Loe said. “Unless we really are going to reorganize how we do everything.”\n\nReferring to those who need the help, she added: “But I would hope that we would give them a lot more warning than this.”\n\nTony Romm and Eduardo Medina contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/frank-bisignano-fiserv-stock-price.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:50:32-04:00","title":"A Top Trump Official Had to Sell His Stock.

He May Have Saved Millions.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T18:50:32-04:00\n\nIn the stock market, timing is everything.\n\nFrank Bisignano, the former chief executive of the global payments and financial-technology company Fiserv, was forced to sell his stake in the company to join the Trump administration as head of the Social Security Administration.\n\nHe did so over several months this year. Between May and August, Mr. Bisignano and his family netted roughly $560 million from their stake in the company, according to securities filings. In doing so, they avoided a dizzying decline in the company’s stock price that started this week after Mr. Bisignano’s successor, Michael Lyons, warned of a steep drop in the company’s growth trajectory and its profits. Mr. Bisignano and his family’s holdings would have been valued at around $215 million at Thursday’s close.\n\nFiserv stunned Wall Street on Wednesday, saying its previous forecasts were too optimistic. Its stock price has dropped nearly 50 percent since the end of trading on Tuesday, erasing nearly $35 billion of its market valuation. Mr. Lyons delivered a damning indictment of the company’s decisions under Mr. Bisignano.\n\n“Over the last few years, decisions to defer certain investments and cut certain costs improve margins in the short term, but are now limiting our ability to serve clients in a world-class way, execute product launches to our standards and grow revenue to our full potential,” Mr. Lyons told investors on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Lyons said he spent his first months in the job, which he assumed after Mr. Bisignano became the commissioner of the Social Security Administration in May, studying Fiserv’s finances and business.\n\n“And as I got a more fulsome understanding of those, that obviously prompted some dissatisfaction with the way we do the process,” Mr. Lyons said. He made a slew of changes to the executive team, including hiring a new chief financial officer and two new co-presidents.\n\nHe also added three new board members from Bridgewater, BlackRock and RBC. Of the new additions, one is a new independent board chairman and two of the new directors will join the audit committee. He also brought in the consulting firm McKinsey to advise them.\n\nMr. Bisignano began selling his Fiserv stock once he was confirmed by the Senate in May. The company’s stock has struggled this year, and Mr. Bisignano began selling after the share price hit its peak in March. In September, Mr. Bisignano filed paperwork with the government saying he had fully divested his holdings.\n\nMr. Bisignano was also tapped this month to simultaneously serve as the chief executive of the Internal Revenue Service, a new role that the Trump administration created after other I.R.S. leaders were fired or quit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is also the acting I.R.S. commissioner, praised Mr. Bisignano at the time as “a businessman with an exceptional track record of driving growth and efficiency.”\n\nA class-action lawsuit filed this summer accuses Mr. Bisignano and Fiserv of misleading investors with inflated growth numbers. Fiserv has said it plans to “vigorously” defend itself in the case. The I.R.S. and Social Security Administration did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Bisignano did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn his final earnings call as chief executive, Mr. Bisignano took a victory lap of sorts, talking about how radically the business had changed over the past five to seven years: “We built this. We executed,” he told analysts in April. “We got through the consolidation, but we’re still optimizing the construction of the company and adding more capability.”\n\nDuring Wednesday’s investor call, Mr. Lyons, who was president of PNC Financial Services before joining Fiserv this year, painted a picture of a business that was run to maximize profits over the short term. He specifically referred to many of his predecessor’s decisions that, if continued, would have put the business on a perilous trajectory.\n\n“While there are certainly some areas where we are dissatisfied with our recent performance, we found that our challenges are largely driven by our own doing,” he said. “Nothing at Fiserv is fundamentally broken.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/30/upshot/obamacare-subsidies-new-prices.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:26:58-04:00","title":"Here’s How Much Obamacare Prices Are Rising Across the Country","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reveals that premiums for Obamacare health insurance plans are rising sharply across the U.S. due to the potential expiration of federal tax subsidies, which were extended in 2021 and 2022.

2025-10-30T11:26:58-04:00\n\nPrices for next year’s Obamacare health insurance plans became public this week, with big increases in premiums across the country. We now have data that shows how much more people will pay.\n\nMost people who buy their own coverage don’t pay full price. Tax credits created by the Affordable Care Act help pay the bills. But the new prices reflect what will happen if extra tax subsidies, first passed in 2021 and extended in 2022, are allowed to expire at the end of this year.\n\nFigures are for the median county. Source: KFF estimates\n\nExtending the subsidies would cost the federal government around $23 billion next year and about $350 billion over the next decade, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. Without them, many Americans will face much higher costs before the midterm elections next fall — in some cases increases of more than a thousand dollars per month.\n\nThe magnitude of the change depends on where people live, how old they are, and what they earn. (More details below.)\n\nThis funding is at the heart of the congressional fight that has left the government shut down for nearly a month. Democrats have demanded an extension as a condition of their support for a government funding bill. Republicans have said they won’t consider an extension until the government is reopened.\n\nThe numbers in our charts and maps come from researchers at the health research group KFF, and reflect insurance prices published on healthcare.gov and state websites that allow people to “window shop” before Saturday, when insurance marketplaces will open for business. An earlier version of this article included estimated premiums for insurance next year, but now we can show the real prices Americans are currently facing.\n\nCongress could still act and change the funding structure, but probably not before people start picking health plans this week.\n\nFor people earning the lowest incomes, the expiration of the subsidies will mean the end of free, generous insurance. Right now, with the extra subsidies, eligible Americans who earn less than $24,000 a year don’t have to contribute money toward their premiums, though they still face some co-payments and deductibles when they use their insurance.\n\nA single person earning $22,000, for example, will have to pay $66 a month for a typical plan after the subsidies expire.\n\nAround half of all enrollees in Affordable Care Act marketplaces nationwide will experience increases in this range — from a free premium to one between $27 and $82 a month. This group includes many people close to the poverty line in states that didn’t expand their Medicaid program. Their insurance will remain heavily subsidized, just at the lower level established by the original Affordable Care Act legislation.\n\nAlthough the price difference in dollars may look small, it can mean a lot for people who earn less than $2,000 a month. Since the enhanced subsidies became law, sign-ups in this lowest income group have tripled, with particularly large increases in Texas, Florida and Georgia. Some critics of the subsidies say the numbers have gotten so high that they are concerned about fraud.\n\nPeople who earn a little more — $35,000 a year —are also facing relatively standard price increases around the country. Their cost for a typical plan will more than double without the extra subsidies, from $86 a month to $218 for a popular plan.\n\nAround 40 percent of enrollees earn between $24,000 and $63,000 and will experience increases of this type.\n\nMany older people at this income level will experience a sharp increase in premiums — from a few hundred dollars a month to $1,000 or more.\n\nIn most states, the enhanced subsidies created a ceiling on how much people earning more than $63,000 have to pay. Without the extra subsidies, people will have to pay whatever insurers in their markets charge. People in this group tend to be self-employed or work for small businesses.\n\nBecause insurers are allowed to charge higher prices to older customers than younger ones, subsidies for Americans at this income level make the biggest difference for people close to retirement age. The large increases in the underlying insurance premiums — around 26 percent on average for a typical plan — pile on top of the lost subsidies.\n\nEstimates are for the median county. Figures are rounded. Source: KFF estimates\n\nBut where people live also matters. Premiums tend to be higher in rural areas, and they are particularly high in a handful of very rural states, like Wyoming and West Virginia.\n\nFor some people in the most expensive markets, the increases could be staggering. A 60-year-old living in southern Illinois will face premiums increasing from $460 a month with the subsidies to $2,800 a month without.\n\nFewer than 10 percent of all Obamacare customers earn $65,000 or more.\n\nPeople with even higher incomes have to pay a lot for Obamacare health insurance, with or without the extra subsidies.\n\nEstimates are for the median county. Source: KFF estimates\n\nMany younger people who earn this much haven’t seen any benefit from the extra subsidies. The subsidies kick in only when the cost of insurance is more than 8.5 percent of their income, which comes up only in the most expensive markets.\n\nBut some older people with high incomes do save money with the extra subsidies. Without them, they will pay even more than they already do.\n\nThis group is also affected by rising premiums. Even though the subsidies didn’t help many of them this year, they still paid lower premiums than insurers are offering in most markets for next year.\n\nOur charts and maps focus on how subsidies affect individuals buying insurance. The math is a bit more complicated for people who are buying insurance for their whole family. But the basic patterns are similar: Families at lower incomes would face more uniform increases, while families at higher incomes would see variable price increases, depending on where they live and the age of each family member.\n\nYou can estimate your personal household costs with and without the subsidies using this calculator from KFF.\n\nThe numbers in our analysis come from researchers at the health research group KFF and are calculated using insurance premiums published on healthcare.gov and state insurance marketplaces as part of “window shopping” for the 2026 plan year. An earlier version of this article was published using estimated price increases for 2026, and showed similar though not identical numbers.\n\nConsumer costs are calculated based on the price of the “benchmark” silver plan in each market, the second-least expensive plan that covers around 70 percent of the average enrollee’s medical costs. Individual consumers may pay more or less if they choose other plans in the market. Calculations account only for federal tax credits and do not include additional state subsidies, available for some consumers in several states.\n\nIn a handful of states, people earning $22,000 won't be immediately affected by subsidy changes because they qualify for different low-cost state insurance programs: Medicaid in Alaska, Hawaii and the District of Columbia; and the basic health plan in Minnesota, Oregon and New York (the basic health plan is Medicaid-like coverage with low premiums for a sliver of low-income Americans in certain states). New York residents earning $35,000 also currently qualify for the basic health plan.\n\nThe federal poverty level is higher in Alaska and Hawaii than in other states, which means the top income cutoff for subsidies in those states is higher than $63,000. That difference explains small differences in the average prices for people at $65,000 and $95,000 in income.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/world/americas/jamaica-hurricane-melissa-disaster-preparedness-finances.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"21:17:54-04:00","title":"Jamaica Prepared a Financial Fortress for Disaster.

Hurricane Melissa Will Test It.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T21:17:54-04:00\n\nHurricane Melissa was among the worst-case scenarios Jamaica could have imagined. The storm’s winds flattened crop fields, homes and businesses. Its rains washed away trees, roads and cars.\n\nAnd yet, the Caribbean island appears surprisingly well-placed to weather at least the financial cost of the damages.\n\nIn recent years, Jamaica has created a multilayered financial plan to respond to natural disasters. The strategy, which analysts say is uncommonly sophisticated, means the government has an arsenal of financial reserves and other tools ready to deploy, with each designed to handle a different level of disaster.\n\n“We can’t prevent the storms and hurricanes that come at us,” Fayval Williams, the country’s finance minister, said at a news conference on Thursday. “But one thing this government can be credited with is putting together a robust national natural disaster risk financing policy.”\n\nThis year, the various tools should amount to about $820 million, Ms. Williams said in June.\n\nJamaicans typically don’t carry much in the way of property insurance. But with 82 percent of the country’s population living within a few miles from the coast, according to the World Bank, and most industries and services located in flood-prone areas, extreme weather poses immense risks to Jamaicans and their economy. So designing a plan to increase government spending after a natural disaster, analysts say, was needed to keep the economy going.\n\nKeenan Falconer, a Jamaican economist who previously worked as an analyst for the country’s finance ministry, said that during past crises, the government’s hands were tied. The first response would be to rearrange the budget to fund relief efforts.\n\n“What that inevitably means is that development is interrupted,” Mr. Falconer said. “The school or hospital that you were planning to build cannot be built because you have to put the fiscal resources elsewhere.”\n\nThe first line of defense in Jamaica’s multilayered financial fortress includes national disaster and contingency funds, pools of money the government has already funded and can be used to pay for immediate needs, like creating shelters and buying emergency supplies.\n\nThe next layers would involve making claims against a Caribbean insurance pool and activating preapproved loans from international organizations like the World Bank. A $150-million catastrophe bond — a financial tool that essentially transfers the risk from Jamaican taxpayers to global investors — is the top layer, reserved for the most catastrophic events.\n\n“If the layers are exhausted,” Ms. Williams told reporters, “we can continue to the next layer.”\n\nThe catastrophe bond has a high bar, and is set with such precision regarding a storm’s intensity and geographic position that Jamaica was disappointed to learn last year that Hurricane Beryl did not trigger the fund when it passed close by the southern coast as a Category 4 storm. At the time, the storm caused an estimated $995 million in damages, including widespread crop losses in St. Elizabeth parish, the country’s breadbasket, where Melissa made landfall.\n\nBut Melissa appears more likely to surpass those stiff requirements.\n\n“Hurricane Melissa will be the true test of whether or not Jamaica insured itself by being fiscally responsible,” said Mikol Mortley, a Jamaican economist and financial analyst. “But one thing I know for certain is that we are better off today than we were last year with Beryl, in 2004 with Ivan and in 1988 with Gilbert.”\n\nBut with some analysts and disaster modelers estimating that the economic losses in Jamaica could reach between $2 billion and $8 billion, representing potentially about a third of the country’s gross domestic product, some fear that even Jamaica’s sophisticated scheme will be overwhelmed.\n\nIt would be impossible for the disaster risk financing tools to finance all reconstruction, analysts said, as they are only designed to get the economy back on its feet and fund emergency repairs — key bridges, hospital roofs, major roads, school buildings.\n\n“Disaster risk financing proceeds cannot solve every problem,” said Mr. Falconer, but it improves the government’s capacity “to respond to affected citizens.”\n\nLong-term reconstruction is expected to be financed mainly by internal resources over time, but Ms. Williams, the finance minister, said Jamaica will also look for international aid.\n\nThe latest storm may also put pressure on Jamaica’s economy. About a decade ago, the country was one of the world’s most indebted nations. Since then, a painful fiscal discipline program has put the country on more stable financial footing.\n\n“We were expected to hit our debt-to-G.D.P. target this year,” said Mr. Mortley. “Will this place that out of alignment? We don’t know.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/business/jpmorgan-jeffrey-epstein.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"22:59:08-04:00","title":"JPMorgan Alerted U.S. to Epstein Transfers Involving Wall St. Figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2019, JPMorgan Chase filed a suspicious activity report identifying over 4,700 transactions worth more than $1 billion involving Jeffrey Epstein and prominent figures such as Leon Black, Glenn Dubin, Alan Dershowitz, and trusts linked to Leslie Wexner.

It also mentioned Mr. Epstein’s wire transfers to Russian banks and sensitivities around “his relationships with two U.S. presidents.” Mr. Epstein at times was close with President Trump and former President Bill Clinton.\n\nNone of the men mentioned in the report have been charged with crimes in connection to Mr. Epstein.\n\nThe report was included in hundreds of pages of previously sealed court records that JPMorgan released on Thursday at the instruction of a federal judge, Jed S. Rakoff. He ordered the documents unsealed in response to requests from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSeveral other suspicious activity reports that JPMorgan filed in the years before Mr. Epstein’s 2019 arrest were also included in the documents released on Thursday. They notified federal regulators to some of Mr. Epstein’s voluminous cash withdrawals, which experts say are a potential hallmark of money laundering and human trafficking.\n\nYet JPMorgan continued to do business with Mr. Epstein for years. The bank lent him money, moved his funds overseas and enabled payments to some of his sex-trafficking victims, The Times reported in September. Bank employees repeatedly raised concerns about the risks of being associated with Mr. Epstein, but senior executives decided to keep his accounts open.\n\nThe 2019 suspicious activity report provided scant details about the transactions in question or why they were considered suspicious, aside from apparently being connected to Mr. Epstein.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Wexner’s trusts, it described $65 million of wire transfers from the mid-2000s that appeared to move between multiple banks. Mr. Epstein served as a trustee for some of Mr. Wexner’s trusts.\n\nFor nearly two decades, until around 2007, Mr. Epstein was a close financial adviser to Mr. Wexner, whose company controlled retailers like the Limited and Victoria’s Secret. Soon after Mr. Epstein’s death, Mr. Wexner accused him of having misappropriated “vast sums” of his money.\n\nThe suspicious activity report pointed to unidentified transactions with Mr. Black, his wife and a Black family partnership. The Times recently reported that Mr. Black had paid Mr. Epstein about $170 million and hundreds of thousands of dollars to at least three women who were associated with Mr. Epstein.\n\nMr. Epstein’s relationship with Mr. Dubin was multifaceted. Mr. Epstein helped broker the sale of Mr. Dubin’s hedge fund to JPMorgan, for which Mr. Epstein received a $15 million fee. Mr. Epstein previously dated Mr. Dubin’s wife, Eva Andersson-Dubin, and was the godfather to the Dubins’ children.\n\nThe suspicious activity report that JPMorgan disclosed on Thursday did not provide details about the transactions involving the Blacks, the Dubins or Mr. Dershowitz.\n\nDevon Spurgeon, a spokeswoman for the Dubins, said the transactions in question were “related to charitable giving, personal gifts or business matters” and unrelated to Mr. Epstein’s crimes.\n\nMr. Dershowitz, who was one of Mr. Epstein’s criminal defense lawyers, said, “The only funds I ever received from Jeffrey Epstein were payments for my legal services based on my hourly rates.”\n\nThe 2019 suspicious activity report also flagged a number of people who worked closely with Mr. Epstein over the years and several of his corporate entities.\n\nA JPMorgan spokeswoman, Patricia A. Wexler, said the documents showed that JPMorgan had repeatedly alerted regulators to red flags surrounding Mr. Epstein by filing suspicious activity reports.\n\n“It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years,” she said.\n\nIn preparing the 2019 suspicious activity report, the bank pulled together every transaction that Mr. Epstein had any involvement with or that had gone through one of his accounts, Ms. Wexler said.\n\nJPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, served Mr. Epstein for more than a decade, a period during which he is believed to have sexually abused some 200 young women and girls, some as young as 14.\n\nThe role of JPMorgan in financing Mr. Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation has drawn new scrutiny after an article in The Times detailed how the bank had repeatedly disregarded red flags about his activities, including frequent large cash withdrawals and other suspicious transactions.\n\nSome lawmakers in Congress have called for hearings into JPMorgan’s role, including demands that Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, answer written questions or testify before a Senate panel.\n\nThe financial records made public on Thursday were produced by JPMorgan during litigation in 2023 that was brought on behalf of victims of Mr. Epstein and by the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he maintained a private island residence that served as a base for most of his financial advisory businesses.\n\nIn 2023, JPMorgan agreed to pay $75 million to the Virgin Islands government to settle the litigation. The bank also paid $290 million to settle the victims’ lawsuit.\n\nJPMorgan has said it regretted its involvement with Mr. Epstein but was not aware of his sexual abuse.\n\nThe unsealed documents include emails in which Mr. Epstein helped to recruit the founders of Google to be JPMorgan clients in the early 2000s. The Times previously reported that one of the founders, Sergey Brin, ultimately put more than $4 billion into a JPMorgan account. The emails also show a JPMorgan executive discussing the potential use of complex trusts to reduce the taxes of Mr. Brin and his co-founder, Larry Page.\n\nA Google representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday night.\n\nThe documents released on Thursday shed little new light on what Mr. Dimon knew about his bank’s relationship with Mr. Epstein. Mr. Dimon has said he was not aware of the bank’s extensive work for him until 2019, though at least one top executive has said under oath that he discussed the Epstein relationship with Mr. Dimon.\n\nMr. Dimon clearly knew by the summer of 2019. On the Saturday in August that Mr. Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell. a JPMorgan employee emailed colleagues with a link to a Times article about his death. That afternoon, an employee forwarded the message to Mr. Dimon.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/hurricane-melissa-jamaica.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:34:42-04:00","title":"Amid Flattened Homes, Jamaica Starts to Assess Hurricane Melissa’s Damage","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded, caused catastrophic damage across Jamaica and Cuba, with 19 deaths confirmed in Jamaica and at least 30 in Haiti.

Jamaica Starts to Assess Hurricane Melissa’s Damage\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T19:34:42-04:00\n\nThe storm flattened and flooded seaside communities, leaving piles of brick, wood and twisted metal. Floodwaters gouged asphalt roads and knocked cars into muddy pits. An elementary school still stood, days later, but roaring winds had sheared the roof off and sent beams splintering onto the desks below.\n\nAs Jamaica worked on Thursday to assess the damage from Hurricane Melissa, it faced a long and daunting road to recovery, particularly in the western part of the country. That region was hardest hit by the hurricane, among the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic, and the memory of the 185 mile-per-hour winds and surging floodwaters was still vivid in residents’ minds.\n\nColeridge Minto, the police superintendent in St. Elizabeth Parish, said he had holed up with about three dozen people at the police station in Black River, a town devastated by the hurricane. He recalled their fear “to listen to the whistle of the wind and observe the vehicles just moving, like swimming in a river.”\n\n“We literally watched some buildings crumble in front of us,” he added.\n\nThe hurricane killed at least 19 people in Jamaica, and at least 30, including children, in Haiti, officials said. Another 20 people were missing and around 20 were injured in Haiti, said Emmanuel Pierre, the director general of the country’s Civil Protection Office.\n\nThe storm also flooded cities and towns in eastern Cuba, leaving behind ruined homes and tangled electrical wires. About 2 million Cubans, or roughly a fifth of the country’s population, were in urgent need of shelter, food, water and health care because of the storm, the U.N.’s resident coordinator for Cuba, Francisco Pichón, said on Thursday.\n\nJamaican authorities were not able to provide “a proper update on the number of deaths so far” because they had not confirmed them all, Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister leading the emergency response, said on Thursday. But he said he expected the toll to rise, as the Jamaican military dispatched a helicopter to recover bodies.\n\nJamaican officials called St. Elizabeth, the southwestern parish where the hurricane made landfall on Tuesday, ground zero of the disaster. A courthouse, library, churches and other historic buildings had been reduced to rubble in the parish capital, Black River, which was decimated.\n\nThe town has long been known as the spot where the Black River meets the sea, and was once a key port where enslaved people packed sugar and rum onto ships. In recent years, it was known as a beloved spot for crocodile safaris or calm holidays at the Waterloo Guest House, which is said to have been the first private home in Jamaica lit by electricity.\n\nBut on Thursday, Black River was now unrecognizable to the people who knew it best.\n\nThe Waterloo Guest House was “just a pile of wood,” said Amiri Bradley, who was visiting the town. Boulders littered the coastline, and a cellphone tower had twisted into a semicircle. The hospital and fire station had either been destroyed or severely damaged, said the mayor, Richard Solomon. Emergency supplies were wiped out when a container carrying them was overturned by floodwaters.\n\nAlong the main street in Black River, supermarkets, furniture stores and other buildings were gone — “all of them, every single one of them,” Superintendent Minto said.\n\n“The area is totally flat,” he said. “There is severe damage to infrastructure, almost all buildings, private properties as well as government buildings were severely damaged — in some cases totally demolished, or 80 to 90 percent damaged.”\n\nMany of the people who took shelter at the Black River police station were neighbors who had nowhere else to go as the floodwaters rose, Superintendent Minto said.\n\n“As their houses started to crumble, they made their way to the station, and that included children,” he said. “It was dangerous, but they took the risk.”\n\nAcross Jamaica, more than 170 communities have been “moderately or severely affected” by flooding or landslides, Mr. McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister leading the emergency response, said on Thursday. Most of them were in the parishes of Manchester, St. Elizabeth, St. James, Trelawny and Westmoreland, he added.\n\nAbout 13,000 people were still in shelters on Thursday, although the number has gone down as many have gone back home, Mr. McKenzie said. He added it had been difficult to assess shelter occupancy in the most devastated parishes because “the communication is very difficult.” More than 400,000 Jamaicans were still without power on Thursday, officials said.\n\nThe Jamaican government said it was it was working with aid groups and others to secure and distribute food and medications to the hardest-hit regions. A “giant working group” will look at how to distribute more than 200,000 aid packages over the next few weeks, Matthew Samuda, the country’s minister of water, environment and climate change, told reporters.\n\nBritain, France and several of Jamaica’s Caribbean neighbors have pledged assistance. The United States was also prepared to provide aid “directly and via local partners who can most effectively deliver it to those in need,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.\n\nHe noted that U.S. law, which forbids nearly all commerce with Cuba, includes “exemptions and authorizations relating to private donations of food, medicine, and other humanitarian goods to Cuba, as well as disaster response.”\n\nCuba’s deputy minister of foreign affairs, Fernández de Cossio, indicated on social media that the country might be willing to accept U.S. assistance. “We have contacted the State Department and we are waiting for clarification on how and in what manner they are willing to help,” he wrote.\n\nIn Bayamo, Cuba, where the hurricane lifted metal roofs off homes or destroyed them entirely, Diana Iglesias, 50, was among the volunteers helping to clean up on Thursday. Her eldest son, she said, was cooking ham and spaghetti for lunch for about 100 people whose homes had flooded when the Bayamo River spilled over its banks.\n\n“Cubans living abroad send donations,” she said. “Everybody does what they can. We help each other.”\n\nReporting was contributed by Michael Crowley, Andre Paulte, Camille Williams and Anushka Patil.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/nyregion/nyc-floods-brooklyn-basement-death.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"21:34:26-04:00","title":"2 Men Die in Basement Flooding as Sudden Downpour Hits New York Area","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two men died in basement flooding in Brooklyn and Manhattan after a sudden, record-breaking downpour of between one and three inches of rain fell across the New York metropolitan area on Thursday, October 30, 2025.

inundated basements in Brooklyn and Manhattan, as sudden heavy, record-setting rains brought flash flooding to the New York area, the police said.\n\nOne man, 39, had become trapped when he went back to his basement in the Flatbush neighborhood to rescue one of his dogs, a neighbor said. A diver pulled him out, a Fire Department spokesman said. He was taken by ambulance to Kings County Hospital, where he died. Officials did not confirm whether his death was caused by flooding.\n\nThe other man, aged 43, was found in a flooded basement boiler room of a building in Washington Heights in Manhattan. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The police did not confirm the names of either man on Thursday night.\n\nThe deaths in Brooklyn and Manhattan came as between one and three inches of rain fell across the tristate area on Thursday, according to Dominic Ramunni, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The downpour broke three daily rainfall records across the metropolitan area. LaGuardia Airport recorded over two inches today, with Newark Liberty International Airport and Central Park reporting 1.9 and 1.8 inches, respectively.\n\nThe rain had been predicted to fall over a period of eight hours. Instead, much of it arrived in an intense, 20-minute downpour that began at about 3:50 p.m., said Aries Dela Cruz, a spokesman for the city’s Emergency Management agency.\n\nThe deluge fell in the midst of a drought, which had left piles of fallen leaves and trash on the streets and sidewalks. The rain swept the detritus toward sewer drains, many of which became clogged.\n\nThe worst of the flooding happened between 3 and 5 p.m., according to FloodNet, an organization that monitors more than 250 flood sensors across the city. The hardest-hit areas were Flatbush and Hollis, Queens, where there were several fatalities in 2021 after the remnants of Hurricane Ida came through. Both neighborhoods experienced floodwaters that were nearly two feet deep. Bushwick, in Brooklyn, and parts of East Flushing, in Queens, were also hard hit.\n\nThe rainstorm was torrential in places. Cars were stuck in floodwaters on city streets, a spokesman for the Fire Department said, and some floated away. Flooding forced the closing of the Long Island Expressway at Springfield Boulevard in Queens in both directions, and downed trees were reported around the city.\n\nThere were scattered subway delays because of water intrusion from the street, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The Long Island Rail Road experienced minor delays.\n\nMetro-North was not affected by flooding, although downed trees caused some delays.  NJ Transit reported delays of up to 30 minutes on rail lines because of high water near Newark Airport.\n\nAmtrak temporarily paused train service around 4 p.m. at Newark Airport because of flooding, a spokeswoman said. And regional and Acela services were delayed when a tree fell in Branford, Conn. Trains are moving again in the Northeast Corridor, she added, although there are some residual delays throughout the network.\n\nRenée Phillips, who lives next door to the man who died in Brooklyn, said he had rescued one of his dogs from the flooded basement and had then gone back to retrieve his other dog. He became trapped, she said, and both the man and his dog died.\n\n“This day has been horrific,” Ms. Phillips said.\n\nIn other parts of the borough, the rain was a nuisance but not life-threatening. Kelly Hayes, a co-owner of the Gowanus Gardens restaurant on Fourth Avenue near Carroll Street on the Park Slope-Gowanus border, a notorious flooding spot, said she had developed a routine response to downpours. As she always does, she began to pay close attention Thursday afternoon to FloodNet.\n\nThe first indication that this storm might bring flooding were the gauges near Prospect Park, which recorded a sharp increase in rain at around 4 p.m., Ms. Hayes said. Within minutes, the water had flowed downhill to Fourth Avenue, where it covered the sidewalk. The water poured into the basement, overflowing the restaurant’s grease trap.\n\n“We got a nice layer of slime all over our basement,” Ms. Hayes said. “It’s disgusting.”\n\nIn Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Andy Franklin brought his daughter to Awa Hair Braiding on Tompkins Avenue, where she wanted to get pink synthetic hair braided into her own. Awa had no pink hair in stock, so Mr. Franklin walked to another store nearby. When he returned about 10 minutes later, he found two cars floating down Tompkins Avenue in four feet of water.\n\nThe owners of Awa Hair Braiding had closed the metal security door to the shop to try to keep out the water. That meant the customers were trapped inside.\n\n“I wanted my daughter out,” said Mr. Franklin, 35. As the downpour eased, the salon’s workers opened the gate, and Mr. Franklin retrieved his daughter.\n\nThe flooding was exacerbated by blocked sewer drains, said Leandro Fernandez, manager of the Alejandro Deli Grocery, which sits across the street from Awa Hair Braiding. Mr. Fernandez and a co-worker poked the drains with broom handles, which eventually succeeded in clearing them.\n\nSimilar work happened in the store’s basement, where an employee named Peter Putter stood for two hours in knee-deep water to clear a drain by hand. At 8 p.m., police officers and workers from the city’s Department of Environmental Protection were on the block, shoveling debris away from storm drains, Mr. Franklin said.\n\nThe storm left 1,500 residents without electricity, said a spokeswoman with the Emergency Management agency. Thunderstorms and low cloud ceilings caused arrival and departure delays at all three of the region’s major airports.\n\nFlooding affected the entire region. In Bayonne, N.J., the police responded to cars trapped by water in underpasses around the city, said Edoardo Ferrante, coordinator of Bayonne’s Office of Emergency Management. In one incident that was recorded and posted to X, an S.U.V. became trapped under an overpass. A firefighter waded into the water, retrieved a 4-year-old-girl from the vehicle and helped the girl’s mother escape.\n\nAlthough the rain has left the region, a wind advisory remains in place through Friday evening, with gusts up to 50 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nMaria Cramer, Sean Piccoli and Chelsia Rose Marcius contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/ohio-redistricting-deal.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:38:38-04:00","title":"Ohio Republicans Gain Ground in Push for More Seats in Congress","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Ohio, Republicans are pushing to redraw congressional boundaries to gain more seats in the House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

2025-10-30T16:43:32-04:00\n\nIn Iowa, a retired math teacher clicked a link in a text message and donated $35. A school secretary in Las Vegas pitched in $50. An interior designer in Pennsylvania, an insurance agent in Chicago and a ski instructor in New Hampshire each gave $100.\n\nTheir small donations all went to California to help Gov. Gavin Newsom try to flip five congressional seats for Democrats.\n\n“I’m so disenchanted with the direction of this country today that I have to support the people that are standing up for democracy,” said Amy Kaufman, the ski instructor. “And Gavin Newsom is one of them.”\n\nResponding to email and text message appeals, small donors from across the country gave Mr. Newsom a combined $38 million for a ballot measure intended to stop President Trump and Republicans from retaining complete control of the federal government in 2026.\n\nNearly half of donors who cumulatively gave at least $100 came from outside of California. In multiple interviews, these donors said they gave to Mr. Newsom because they saw him as one of the few Democrats fighting Republicans on their own terms. After President Trump asked leaders in Texas and other red states to pursue rare, mid-decade gerrymandering to offset potential midterm losses for Republicans, California is the closest of any Democrat-led state to striking back so far.\n\nPolls suggest that California voters are very likely to pass Mr. Newsom’s redistricting measure on Tuesday, a win that could serve as the ultimate foundation for a 2028 presidential run that he is considering. If he runs, he could tell voters that he directly fought back against Mr. Trump in the midterms.\n\nAnd he would emerge with a national list of donors and supporters that few other Democratic hopefuls have at the moment.\n\nThe list began more than 25 years ago, when Mr. Newsom was a wine entrepreneur just getting his footing as a politician. Mr. Newsom said in an interview that he started building an email list of donors when he was on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and wanted to gather support for a bond measure to fund parks.\n\n“I started going, ‘Oh, emails, that’s interesting and novel,” he recalled. “‘I should use these.’”\n\nFrom there, he took a methodical approach to building his list, gathering more names and emails every time he ran for another office or put an initiative on the ballot. The list includes names that Mr. Newsom has collected organically, as well as those in databases he has purchased.\n\nThe project accelerated in 2021 when Republicans tried to recall Mr. Newsom and he reached out to Democrats across the country for support. Then, in 2023, Mr. Newsom created a political action committee to support Democrats in Republican-controlled states — giving him a reason to collect more names and emails from beyond California.\n\nBuilding the list had become a discipline. Mr. Newsom called the list “huge” but declined to say an exact number. He now calls the list “the most valuable asset” of his political career.\n\n“It’s a very deliberative investment,” Mr. Newsom said. “It’s a lot of resources. It’s a lot of time and a lot of iteration.”\n\nAlong the way, Mr. Newsom picked up contact info for Steven Lamansky, a retired high school math teacher in Ankeny, Iowa, just north of Des Moines. Mr. Lamansky sent his first $35 donation to the Proposition 50 campaign on Aug. 10 after receiving a text message pitch from Mr. Newsom’s campaign. Two weeks later, he sent another $35. The next month, $35 more.\n\nMr. Lamansky, 77, said he donated because he wanted to counter gerrymandering in Republican-led states and help Democrats to take back the House next year. But he also pitched in specifically to boost Mr. Newsom.\n\n“I find him a very dynamic person,” Mr. Lamansky said. “Every time I’ve heard him on different shows, he’s really got his ducks in a row. He knows his facts. I really like him, and I’d like to see him run for president.”\n\nMr. Newsom has curated his national image, just as he has his supporter list. He has gone on Fox News to attack Republicans, including a face-off with Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida in 2023 that was billed as “The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate.” He started the podcast “This Is Gavin Newsom” this year, turning heads when he asked conservatives like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon why the Democrats failed in 2024.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump sent National Guard troops to Southern California in June during immigration raids and protests, Mr. Newsom returned to his place as a chief antagonist of the Republican president. One night, with troops in Los Angeles, he gave a speech on national television warning Americans that “democracy is under assault right before our eyes.”\n\nThis summer, Mr. Newsom used a more experimental communication strategy. With help from his young staff, Mr. Newsom adopted an aggressively satirical voice mocking Mr. Trump on social media. And he began appearing on platforms that cater to young, male audiences — a cohort that Democrats lost ground with in last year’s election.\n\nBetween banter about sports and video games, the governor has slipped in pleas for his redistricting measure into the “All the Smoke” podcast, which is hosted by two retired N.B.A. players, and a livestreamed game of Fortnite with a Twitch streamer known as ConnorEatsPants.\n\nRepublicans have struggled to counter Mr. Newsom on Proposition 50, in part because of the governor’s fund-raising prowess, but also because he was so effective in making the race a referendum on Mr. Trump in a Democratic state. They lacked a central figure or message around which to build a groundswell of opposition.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Kiley, a California Republican who would become immediately vulnerable if Proposition 50 passes, has spent years challenging Mr. Newsom, including during the 2023 recall when he ran as a candidate for governor.\n\nMr. Kiley has been a lonely voice in Washington calling for a national prohibition on mid-decade redistricting. He said the ballot measure seemed to be serving as a “launching pad” for Mr. Newsom’s 2028 aspirations.\n\n“His entire governorship,” Mr. Kiley said, “he has treated as a warm-up to running for president.”\n\nMr. Newsom’s efforts have resonated with Democratic voters beyond California, as he has climbed to the top of several Democratic presidential primary polls in the months since he began the redistricting campaign.\n\nIt is, of course, too early to anoint any contender, let alone Mr. Newsom. The California governor could struggle in many states to overcome his reputation as a liberal coastal elite, an image that Democrats are desperately trying to shed at the moment.\n\nThough Mr. Newsom is getting a lot of traction with the Democratic activist base, it does not mean he will win a primary three years from now, said Mike Murphy, a former adviser to Republican presidential candidates who supported Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020 and Kamala Harris last year instead of Mr. Trump.\n\n“He’s got a flashy thing of the moment,” Mr. Murphy said. “In the 100 steps to the nomination, it doesn’t hurt him. I just think you can overrate it.”\n\nMatt Bennett, a Democratic strategist who worked on campaigns for former President Bill Clinton, said that Mr. Newsom may also have a hard time running a presidential campaign because of a perception nationally that California is a troubled state.\n\n“What he can do is run on his aggressive efforts to take on Trump and MAGA in various ways,” Mr. Bennett said, adding that the redistricting measure would be “the most important and prominent of them.”\n\nSteven Rich contributed data analysis, and Shane Goldmacher contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/business/amazon-earnings.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:54:45-04:00","title":"Amazon’s Profit Is Up 38% on Strong Performance","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amazon reported a significant 38% year-over-year profit increase to $21.2 billion in the third quarter of 2025, driven by resilient consumer spending and a resurgence in cloud computing.

2025-10-30T16:54:45-04:00\n\nAmazon reported unexpectedly strong sales and profit on Thursday across both its consumer and its cloud businesses, and said another robust quarter might be ahead.\n\nThe company’s sales totaled $180.2 billion from July through September, up 13 percent from a year earlier. Profit was $21.2 billion, up 38 percent. The overall results were buoyed by the enduring strength of consumer spending online, despite tariffs and an uneven economy, and by a resurgence in cloud computing.\n\n“We continue to see strong momentum and growth across Amazon as A.I. drives meaningful improvements in every corner of our business,” Andy Jassy, the chief executive, said in a statement. He added that the company’s cloud services business had grown at its fastest pace since 2022.\n\nThe strong quarter, which beat analysts’ expectations, sent Amazon’s stock soaring more than 10 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nAmazon had previously warned investors to brace for an uncertain quarter, particularly regarding how much its costs might grow.\n\nMore than anything, investors have been nervous about Amazon’s cloud computing division, which has long been its primary source of profits. Amazon invented the business of cloud computing and was long the dominant player. But in 2022, ChatGPT was introduced by OpenAI, which built and operated the artificial intelligence chatbot on Microsoft’s services, and Amazon was widely viewed as being caught flat-footed. Google, Microsoft and Meta raced to find ways to develop and use A.I. systems.\n\nAmazon has made large investments, too, but after years of hovering around a third of the cloud computing market, its share slipped to 30 percent in the first half of this year, according to Synergy Research Group.\n\nAmazon “has done remarkably well” given how competitors have aggressively pursued its lead, said John Dinsdale, the research director at Synergy.\n\nMany investors were eyeing whether Amazon could stop or even reverse that trend.\n\nOn Thursday, Amazon reported that the growth of its cloud division had picked up speed, with sales of $33 billion, up 20 percent from a year earlier. While still slower than its peers, it offered a brighter outlook.\n\nAmazon spent more than $34 billion on capital expenditures in the quarter, in large part to set up data centers that power cloud computing and A.I. That sets it well on the path to meet investor expectations that capital expenditures will top $120 billion for the year.\n\nDespite all the building, the company has not had enough data centers up and operating to meet customer demand, depressing sales.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley recently wrote that Amazon needed to quickly get more data center capacity online to no longer be considered a “loser” in the era of generative A.I.\n\nAmazon attributed $9.5 billion in profit to the value of its investment in the A.I. start-up Anthropic, which has become a flagship customer of its cloud computing.\n\nAmazon’s retail business has generally weathered the frequent whiplash of President Trump’s tariffs better than investors initially feared. The company and the sellers on its marketplace stocked up on inventory in the United States before the new duties, a move that Amazon said had provided some insulation against them.\n\nThe number of items that Amazon sold in the quarter grew 11 percent, a sign that consumers were not pulling back drastically. Its advertising business, which largely promotes products to customers on its site, remained strong, with $17.7 billion in sales.\n\nThe company has been aggressively looking to do more with less. This week it announced that it was laying off 14,000 corporate employees. And The New York Times reported last week that Amazon’s automation team had ambitious goals to use robotics to avoid hiring more than half a million workers by 2033.\n\nThe company had 1.58 million employees, up slightly from a year earlier.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/business/apple-earnings.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:28:45-04:00","title":"Apple’s iPhones Fuel Record Sales and Profit","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Apple reported record quarterly revenue and profit in the September 2025 quarter, driven by a $100 price increase on popular iPhone models and strong demand for new designs like the iPhone Air and iPhone Pro.

The higher prices helped Apple rake in more money during a period when analysts estimated that the company sold one million more iPhones than a year earlier.\n\nTotal revenue rose 8 percent to $102.5 billion from a year earlier, the first time the company made more than $100 billion during the three months that ended in September. Profit rose 86 percent to $27.5 billion, after its net income was hit a year ago by a tax payment.\n\nIn September, Apple gave customers a reason to buy its newest iPhones by changing their external design. It unveiled a thinner and smaller model called the iPhone Air and overhauled the iPhone Pro to feature a raised bump across its back. The changes helped drive iPhone sales to $49 billion in the quarter, up 6 percent from last year.\n\nThe results topped expectations. Wall Street analysts had predicted quarterly sales of $101.52 billion and profit of $26.34 billion. Apple’s shares rose more than 4 percent in after-hours trading, after it projected total revenue in the current quarter to increase 10 percent to 12 percent.\n\nThe performance was marred by business in China, where sales fell 3.6 percent to $14.5 billion. But Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said Chinese customers wanted more iPhone 17 models than the company was able to produce. He expected sales in China to increase in the current quarter.\n\n“I couldn’t be more pleased with how things are going there,” Mr. Cook said.\n\nThe iPhone’s popularity has helped the company continue to wring more money out of users from apps and services like Apple Pay and Google, which pays it about $20 billion annually to automatically fulfill search queries on Apple devices. Services revenue rose 15 percent to $28.8 billion.\n\nLast month, Apple caught a break when a federal judge ruled that Google, which had been found to be an internet search monopoly, could continue paying to automatically fulfill search queries on iPhones. The ruling meant that Apple could continue collecting payments from Google, and also opened the door for it to charge A.I. companies to reach iPhone customers.\n\nThomas G. Plumb, president of Wisconsin Capital Management, said that the Google ruling and iPhone 17 had “been a pleasant surprise.” But he added: “They have to show they have a plan to move the needle for the next few years with A.I.”\n\nApple has largely avoided the artificial intelligence arms race. It is not pouring billions of dollars into data centers, developing expensive A.I. systems or building its own chatbot. It canceled a plan to release a more personalized version of its virtual assistant, Siri, saying the A.I. product it was developing did not meet its quality standards and needed improvement. Mr. Cook said the product will be released next year.\n\nThose stumbles have weighed on Apple’s stock. Shares of Google and Microsoft have soared more than 25 percent this year, but Apple’s share price has risen a more modest 11 percent.\n\nThis week, the company reached a value of $4 trillion. That was overshadowed on Wednesday when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable public company and dominant provider of A.I. chips, became the first company to be valued at more than $5 trillion.\n\nApple posted mixed results from its other main businesses. Mac sales rose 13 percent to $8.7 billion, but sales of iPads and wearables like the Apple Watch were flat.\n\nPresident Trump’s trade policy continues to give Apple headaches. The company makes almost all of its products abroad; many of its iPhones are made in China, which has a higher tariff rate than other countries.\n\nThough Apple has been producing more iPhones for the United States in India, it paid about $1.1 billion in tariffs in the September quarter. It expects the costs of tariffs to rise to $1.4 billion in the current quarter, even after Mr. Trump agreed this week to reduce tariffs on China to 10 percent from 20 percent.\n\nApple has promised to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, but has not committed to manufacturing any of its products in the country.\n\nIn August, Mr. Cook visited the White House and presented Mr. Trump with a 24-karat gold plaque. He also lavished the president with praise and committed to buy more semiconductors manufactured in America.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/arts/design/museum-heist-oakland-california.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:05:52-04:00","title":"Over 1,000 Objects Are Stolen From Oakland Museum","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 1,000 cultural artifacts, including jewelry, daguerreotypes, laptops, and significant artworks like pieces by artist Florence Resnikoff and 19th-century scrimshawed walrus tusks, were stolen from the Oakland Museum of California at its off-site storage facility just before 3:30 a.m. on Oct. 15.

The U.S. military strikes have killed at least 61 people since early September.\n\nVisibly agitated, Mr. Warner said that the Republicans-only meeting was a violation of a law requiring bipartisan briefings of congressional leaders on national security matters.\n\n“When an administration decides it can pick and choose which elected representatives get the understanding of their legal argument of why this is needed for military force and only chooses a particular party, it ignores all the checks and balances,” he said.\n\nOn other side of the Capitol, military legal experts had been scheduled to testify in a closed-door bipartisan briefing for the House. But the Trump administration decided not to send them.\n\n“They didn’t even show up with the lawyers,” said Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, after the meeting.\n\nHe said that without the Defense Department’s legal advisers, lawmakers on the House Armed Services Committee were unable to obtain an explanation of the legal basis for the military strikes.\n\n“They just said that they can’t answer these questions because the lawyers aren’t here,” he said.\n\nA senior Trump administration official, discussing the strikes on the condition of anonymity, said the administration had been far more forthcoming on their legal rationale than the Obama administration had been when it conducted covert drone strikes against terrorist targets.\n\nA White House spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, said the Democratic complaints were “bogus” and an effort to distract from the government shutdown.\n\n“The Department of War has held nine bipartisan briefings on narco-terrorist strikes, with additional bipartisan briefings scheduled, and individually works through requests from the Hill,” Ms. Kelly said.\n\nThe House briefing was led by Rear Adm. Brian H. Bennett, a military officer overseeing Special Operations for the Pentagon’s Joint Staff. Mr. Moulton said he gave him a lecture.\n\n“The last word that I gave to the admiral is, ‘I hope you recognize the constitutional peril that you are in, and the peril you are putting our troops in,’” he said.\n\nRepresentative Sara Jacobs, Democrat of California, said the Pentagon officials conceded that the administration did not know the identities of all of the individuals who were killed in the strikes.\n\n“They said that they do not need to positively identify individuals on the vessel to do the strikes,” she said.\n\nThe Trump administration has designated a number of cartels as terrorist organizations and asserted that gives the military the power to target boats trafficking drugs, though experts have questioned that authority.\n\nMs. Jacobs said Pentagon officials said they needed to prove only that the targeted people were connected to designated terrorist organizations, even if the connection is “as much as three hops away from a known member” of a designated terrorist organization.\n\nThe people who have survived the strikes have been sent to other countries and released. None have been taken into American custody.\n\n“Part of why they could not actually hold or try the individual that survived one of the attacks was because they could not satisfy the evidentiary burden,” Ms. Jacobs said.\n\nThe Constitution vests the power to declare war and authorize military operations in Congress. But Republicans, who control both chambers, have not passed an authorization for the escalating campaign against the drug traffickers.\n\nRepresentative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado, has introduced legislation to reassert congressional oversight, but has been frustrated by the failure of the House to consider such measures.\n\n“A large reason why this is happening is because Congress has for decades allowed it to happen,” Mr. Crow said. “It’s gotten out of control, and it’s time to fix it.”\n\nFrustration is growing among Democrats and Republicans that the Trump administration has not provided the classified memo written by the Justice Department that lays out the legal argument for the strikes.\n\nTo address the concerns of Republicans, the Trump administration held the briefing on Wednesday for a dozen G.O.P. senators.\n\nSenator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, a Republican on the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee, said the White House called him after he asked why the Wednesday briefing had not included Democrats.\n\n“And I said, yep, because Intel and Armed Services, we do things on a bipartisan basis when it comes to this, we want to keep it that way,” he said.\n\nMr. Rounds said he hoped Democrats received the same information “because it was a very good briefing; it explained a lot of stuff.”\n\nSenator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, who has raised some questions about the boat strikes, requested the briefing, according to congressional officials.\n\nMr. Warner said that he appreciated Mr. Rounds’s comments but that the Republican lawmakers should have walked out of the briefing.\n\nThe Trump administration, Mr. Warner said, needed to make the Justice Department’s memo and the target list available to all members of the Senate.\n\n“If we allow this kind of foul to take place, what happens next time?” Mr. Warner said. “I shouldn’t be shocked. Only Republicans were called before the strike on Iran.”\n\nLawmakers asked Pentagon officials in the House briefing on Thursday to provide that legal memo, according to a U.S. official, who discussed the classified briefing on the condition of anonymity. But the Pentagon officials would not say when they would turn it over. The delay, the U.S. official added, was because the White House does not want to show members of Congress the memo.\n\nMr. Crow said the House briefing contained no discussion of the administration’s larger strategy, adding that the presentation had only deepened his concerns.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Crow said the United States was “spending vast amounts of money” for very little.\n\n“It looks as though the Trump administration has learned nothing from our last 20 years of war, and it’s going to end up giving us the same lackluster results,” he said.\n\nMs. Jacobs said House lawmakers pressed the Pentagon briefers for details about the drugs that were on the boats struck by the military.\n\nPresident Trump has claimed, without evidence, the strikes had destroyed both cocaine and fentanyl, a far more deadly drug. But Colombia mostly produces only cocaine, which is trafficked through Venezuela, according to experts.\n\n“They admitted that all of the narcotics coming out of this part of the world is cocaine,” Ms. Jacobs said. “They, you know, talked a little bit about the connection between cocaine and fentanyl, although I’m not convinced that what they said was accurate.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/opinion/trump-autocracy-democracy-report.html","dateOfPublication":"0000-01-01","timeOfPublication":"00:00:00Z","title":"Are We Losing Our Democracy?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The editorial board of The New York Times warns that the United States is experiencing a significant regression in democratic principles, citing 12 benchmarks of democratic erosion.

His actions have raiseda chilling question.\n\nBy The Editorial BoardThe editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom.\n\nCountries that slide from democracy toward autocracy tend to follow similar patterns. To measure what is happening in the United States, the Times editorial board has compiled a list of 12 markers of democratic erosion, with help from scholars who have studied this phenomenon. The sobering reality is that the United States has regressed, to different degrees, on all 12.\n\nOur country is still not close to being a true autocracy, in the mold of Russia or China. But once countries begin taking steps away from democracy, the march often continues. We offer these 12 markers as a warning of how much Americans have already lost and how much more we still could lose.\n\nAn authoritarian stifles dissent and speech. Trump has started to.\n\nAuthoritarian takeovers in the modern era often do not start with a military coup. They instead involve an elected leader who uses the powers of the office to consolidate authority and make political opposition more difficult, if not impossible. Think of Vladimir Putin in Russia, Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and, to lesser degrees, Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, Viktor Orban in Hungary and Narendra Modi in India. These leaders have repressed dissent and speech in heavy-handed ways.\n\nOver the past year, President Trump and his allies have impinged on free speech to a degree that the federal government has not since perhaps the Red Scare of the 1940s and 1950s. His administration pressured television stations to stop airing Jimmy Kimmel’s talk show when Mr. Kimmel criticized Trump supporters after the murder of Charlie Kirk; revoked the visas of foreign students for their views on the war in Gaza; and ordered investigations of liberal nonprofit groups. Mr. Trump so harshly criticizes people who disagree with him, including federal judges, that they become targets of harassment from his supporters.\n\nThe Bottom LineMany forms of speech and dissent remain vibrant in the United States. But the president has tried to dull them. His evident goal is to cause Americans to fear they will pay a price for criticizing him, his allies or his agenda.\n\nAn authoritarian persecutes political opponents. Trump has.\n\nIn addition to restricting speech and dissent, autocrats use the immense power of law enforcement to investigate and imprison people who have fallen out of favor. Mr. Trump’s Justice Department has become an enforcer of his personal interests, targeting people for legally dubious reasons while creating a culture in which his allies can act with impunity.\n\nFollowing the president’s demands, his appointees have secured indictments of a few critics (including Attorney General Letitia James of New York and the former F.B.I. director James Comey) and ordered investigations of others (including Senator Adam Schiff of California). Some of these appointees were once Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers. Mr. Trump has also used executive orders to go after perceived enemies, including law firms representing his critics. And he has systematically fired government employees who played roles in earlier investigations of him or his allies.\n\n“We are all afraid,” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, said this spring. “It’s quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been here before. I’ll tell you, I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real.”\n\nMr. Trump has simultaneously shielded his own supporters from legal consequences for their actions, including through his blanket pardon of the Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nThe Bottom LineTrue authoritarians go much further than Mr. Trump has, but he has already targeted his opponents with legal persecution in shocking ways.\n\nAn authoritarian bypasses the legislature. Trump has started to.\n\nWhen a democracy slides toward autocracy, the leader often finds ways to neuter the legislature, turning it into a body that rubber stamps his decisions. Congress has started down this path. The Constitution makes clear, in Article I, that Congress alone has the power of the purse. Mr. Trump is undermining this system.\n\nHis administration has violated federal law at least six times by withholding funding authorized by Congress for libraries, preschools, scientific research and more, the Government Accountability Office found. He has gutted or dismantled congressionally authorized agencies like the Department of Education and U.S.A.I.D. He has also imposed new taxes — his tariffs — without congressional approval. Since the current government shutdown began, he has used donations from billionaires to pay troops and finance the construction of a ballroom at the White House.\n\nSome of the blame lies with the Republican leaders of Congress, who have failed to fight his power grabs. Their complicity does not change the fact that these power grabs have been illegal.\n\nThe Bottom LineMr. Trump has defied the Constitution by trampling on Congress’s power of the purse. In full autocracies, legislatures often formally transfer some of their authority to the executive, and some congressional Republicans have proposed such changes.\n\nAn authoritarian uses the military for domestic control.  Trump has started to.\n\nEven democracies occasionally use their militaries on home soil. The military can keep order and protect citizens after a devastating storm. In extreme and rare circumstances, troops can enforce the law when local authorities refuse to do so, as happened in the segregated South in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAuthoritarians use the military much more frequently and performatively — to suppress dissent, instill fear and convey supreme power. Mr. Trump deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles to crack down on protests, despite local officials’ insistence that they had the situation under control. He attempted the same in Portland, Ore., and Chicago, before being restrained by federal courts. He has also begun to treat the military as an extension of himself, firing several high-ranking officials without good reason and summoning hundreds of leaders to Virginia to listen to overtly political speeches by him and his appointees.\n\nThe Bottom LineMr. Trump’s use of the military for domestic control has been limited. But his willingness to use it as he has — and his threats to expand that use, through the invocation of the Insurrection Act and with troops beyond the National Guard — is extremely worrisome.\n\nAn authoritarian defies the courts. Trump has started to.\n\nWould-be authoritarians recognize that courts can keep them from consolidating power, and they often take steps to weaken or confront judges.\n\nMr. Trump has baldly defied federal judges on several occasions. In March, for instance, his administration ignored a federal judge’s order to turn around airplanes that were deporting migrants to El Salvador. More often, the Trump administration has engaged in gamesmanship, going around orders rather than directly disobeying them. One example: After a federal judge blocked his deployment of the Oregon National Guard, the administration moved to deploy National Guards from other states instead.\n\nSo far, Mr. Trump has defied no Supreme Court orders and has pledged not to. But the justices have too often played into his strategy by failing to stand up for lower courts.\n\nThe Bottom LineIt is a hopeful sign that he has not ignored the Supreme Court, and the court may yet block his most blatant power grabs. Still, the court’s reluctance to restrain him appears to have emboldened him to sidestep lower court orders he does not like.\n\nAn authoritarian declares national emergencies on false pretenses. Trump has.\n\nAuthoritarians often curtail democracy by declaring an emergency and arguing that the threat requires them to exercise unusual degrees of power.\n\nMr. Trump’s recent predecessors were not perfect on this issue. They sometimes declared questionable emergencies. He has gone to another level. He has used manufactured emergencies to sidestep Congress and impose tariffs, deregulate the energy industry, intensify immigration enforcement and send the National Guard into Washington. Chillingly, he has claimed that a Venezuelan gang invaded the United States to justify the killing of foreign civilians in international waters, in defiance of U.S. and international law.\n\nThe Bottom LineMr. Trump’s willingness to kill people without due process, through the blowing up of boats that American officials could instead stop and search, represents one of his most extreme abuses of power. It raises the prospect that he may expand the use of emergency power to other areas, including domestic law enforcement.\n\nAn authoritarian vilifies marginalized groups. Trump has.\n\nAuthoritarians tend to demean minority groups, trying to turn them into a perceived threat that provides a justification for a leader to amass power. Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested that marginalized groups are responsible for the nation’s problems.\n\nImmigrants have topped his list. Mr. Trump has blamed them for destroying communities and his administration has tried to dehumanize them by posting mocking videos of shackled immigrants. In response, many Latinos have stopped speaking Spanish in public and started carrying their passports to prove citizenship.\n\nHe has vilified transgender Americans and barred them from military service. He has fired women and people of color from leadership posts and ended programs that promote workplace diversity. His administration has attempted to erase aspects of Black history, including by removing books on slavery and segregation from military libraries and pressuring Smithsonian museums to minimize those subjects. At the same time, he has suggested that white people and Christians are victims, which echoes the autocratic habit of claiming that majority groups are in fact oppressed.\n\nThe Bottom LineMr. Trump is borrowing from the autocrats' playbook by suggesting that some citizens are legitimate and others are second-class.\n\nAn authoritarian controls information and the news media. Trump has started to.\n\nDemocratic governments prize accurate information as a guide to decision-making. Authoritarians seek to suppress inconvenient truths.\n\nMr. Trump has sought to manipulate government information in several ways. He fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the agency reported disappointing job growth this summer. He shut down federal data collection efforts related to climate change, presumably because the information might encourage people to take action.\n\nHe has also taken steps to control the media, both traditional forms and new ones. He arranged for the sale of TikTok from a Chinese company to investors with ties to his political allies. He pushed Congress to end funding for public radio and television. He extracted multimillion-dollar payments from ABC, Paramount (which owns CBS), YouTube and Meta to settle baseless claims that he has been treated unfairly, and he is pursuing lawsuits against The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. All of these moves are meant to reduce coverage that does not parrot his views.\n\nThe Bottom LineIn place of an independent and free press, Mr. Trump evidently hopes to create a shadow ecosystem willing to promote his interests and talking points.\n\nAn authoritarian tries to take over universities. Trump has started to.\n\nAuthoritarians, recognizing that universities are hotbeds of independent thought and political dissent, often single them out for repression. Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan have closed universities. Mr. Modi’s government has arrested dissident scholars, while Mr. Orban has appointed loyalist foundations to run universities.\n\nA signature policy of Mr. Trump’s second term has been his attack on higher education. He has cut millions of dollars of research funding, tried to dictate hiring and admissions policies and forced the resignation of the University of Virginia’s president. It is a sustained campaign to weaken an influential sector home to many political progressives who do not support him — and to many young people, who typically form the crux of anti-authoritarian protest movements.\n\nThe Bottom LineBecause the federal government finances so much academic research, it has considerable power over universities. Initially, some universities seemed as if they might simply submit to Mr. Trump’s demands. More recently, several showed more willingness to resist, rejecting a proposal that would have rewarded them financially for adopting Trump-friendly policies.\n\nAn authoritarian creates a cult of personality. Trump has.\n\nEmperors and kings often glorified themselves by displaying their portraits everywhere. The American tradition has rejected that kind of hagiography for living presidents. Our leaders haven’t needed to puff themselves up this way, until now.\n\nHuge banners with Mr. Trump’s face hang from government buildings. He posts memes in which he wears a crown, including an A.I.-generated video that depicted him defecating on protesters. He held a lavish military parade on his birthday. At televised meetings, members of his cabinet gush sycophantic praise. He announced the creation of a meme coin with his likeness. To celebrate the country’s 250th birthday next year, the Treasury Department plans to put his face on a physical coin.\n\nThe Bottom LineThe Trump cult of personality plays into his claims — common among autocrats — that he possesses a unique ability to solve the country’s problems. As he put it, “I alone can fix it.” He seeks to equate himself with the federal government, as if it does not exist without him.\n\nAn authoritarian uses power for personal profit. Trump has.\n\nAuthoritarians often turn the government into a machine for enriching themselves, their families and their allies. Mr. Trump glories in his administration’s culture of corruption.\n\nHe openly uses the presidency as an opportunity to pad his bottom line, in ways that range from the comically petty (like charging the Secret Service up to $1,200 per night for rooms at his hotels) to the shamelessly greedy (like the $40 million that Amazon paid for the rights to a Melania Trump documentary or his recent demand that the government pay him $230 million because he was investigated for breaking the law). He solicits favors from foreign governments, including an airplane from Qatar. His children also profit from their father’s position, through real-estate deals, crypto, a private club in Washington and more. And he rewards those who enrich them, recently pardoning the head of a cryptocurrency firm who worked with the Trump family.\n\nIn the first six months of this year, the Trump Organization’s income soared to $864 million, up from just $51 million a year earlier, according to a recent Reuters analysis. It’s worth noting that recent Supreme Court decisions have made corruption harder to police.\n\nThe Bottom LineMr. Trump’s culture of corruption may resemble the behavior of foreign autocrats more closely than any other category on this list. He is using what rightly belongs to American citizens — the power and resources of our democratic government — to enrich himself, and he is not trying to hide it.\n\nAn authoritarian manipulates the law to stay in power. Trump has started to.\n\nAuthoritarians change election rules to help their party, and they rewrite laws — or violate their spirit — to ignore term limits.\n\nMr. Trump’s biggest attempt to follow this playbook failed, when he was unable to undo his election defeat to Joe Biden in 2020. But that effort showed Mr. Trump’s willingness to break the law to remain in power.\n\nIn his second term, he has shown worrisome signs of using his power to entrench the Republican Party’s hold on the government. He has pressed Republicans to take gerrymandering to a new extreme. He issued an executive order in March that seeks to interfere with how states run their elections. These moves increase the chances that Republicans will keep control of Congress even if most voters want to oust them.\n\nMr. Trump has not taken concrete steps to remain in power for a third term, which the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution was written to forbid. He has alternated between floating the idea and suggesting he understands that he must leave the presidency for good on Jan. 20, 2029.\n\nThe Bottom LineEven if he backs away from any scheme to serve more than two presidential terms, Mr. Trump’s attempts to tilt the electoral field in favor of Republicans is anti-democratic and could pervert American elections for years.\n\nThe clearest sign that a democracy has died is that a leader and his party make it impossible for their opponents to win an election and hold power. Once that stage is reached, however, the change is extremely difficult to reverse. And aspiring authoritarians use other excesses, like a cowed legislature and judiciary, to lock in their power.\n\nThe United States is not an autocracy today. It still has a mostly free press and independent judiciary, and millions of Americans recently attended the “No Kings” protests. But it has started down an anti-democratic path, and many Americans — including people in positions of power — remain far too complacent about the threat.\n\nThe 12 benchmarks in this editorial offer a way to understand and measure how much further Mr. Trump goes in the months and years ahead. We plan to update this index in 2026.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/health/marthe-gautier-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:30:59-04:00","title":"Marthe Gautier, 96, Dies; Had Key Role in Down Syndrome Breakthrough","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dr. Marthe Gautier, a pioneering physician and geneticist, was the primary researcher who identified the chromosomal cause of Down syndrome in 1958 at the Armand-Trousseau Hospital in Paris.

Dies; Had Key Role in Down Syndrome Breakthrough\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T18:30:59-04:00\n\nDr. Marthe Gautier, a physician and researcher who had a major role in identifying the cause of Down syndrome but whose achievement was undermined when a male colleague took credit for her work, died on April 30, 2022. She was 96.\n\nHer death, in a retirement home in Meaux, France, though not widely reported at the time, was confirmed by her great-niece Tatiana Giraud. The New York Times, which had prepared an obituary about Dr. Gautier in advance, in 2018, learned of her death only recently.\n\nThe disputed research in which Dr. Gautier was involved produced a historic breakthrough: It revealed that people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome, one of the microscopic strands of DNA and protein that carry a person’s genetic blueprint.\n\nMost humans have 46 chromosomes. Down syndrome is also called trisomy 21, meaning that three copies of the 21st chromosome are present instead of two, for a total of 47 chromosomes.\n\nThe discovery, at the Armand-Trousseau Hospital in Paris in 1958, was the first to link an abnormal number of chromosomes to a disorder that causes intellectual disability. More connections between such conditions and aberrant chromosomes were soon found.\n\nThose advances led to the development of tests to diagnose the disorders before birth, making it possible to terminate affected pregnancies in many cases.\n\nDr. Gautier’s story “starts like a fairy tale and ends like villainy,” said Dr. Jean Kachaner, a former student of hers who is a pediatric cardiologist at the Necker Hospital for children in Paris.\n\nAt 25, Dr. Gautier was a brilliant physician with a promising future: Among 80 candidates for sought-after internships at the Paris Hospitals in 1950, she was one of only two women chosen. Outstanding in that role, she was then awarded a scholarship in 1955 to study for a year at Harvard.\n\nBack in Paris in 1956, she went to work at the Armand-Trousseau Hospital, for Dr. Raymond Turpin, a pediatrician and geneticist whom she later described in an essay as “very distant and laconic.”\n\nDr. Turpin had long suspected that Down syndrome might be caused by a chromosome abnormality, but lamented that no one in Paris knew how to grow the cell cultures needed to test his theory.\n\nDr. Gautier told an interviewer in 2013, “It struck me in a rather negative way, that here was a man who had proposed a genetic hypothesis for Down syndrome nearly 20 years before, and yet he had not gone on to pursue his theory.”\n\nDr. Gautier offered to try — she had become an expert in cell culture at Harvard — and was allowed to proceed. But she was given only primitive lab space and a low-power microscope. She paid for other equipment out of her pocket, drew her own blood to feed the cell cultures and bought a young rooster to bleed periodically for its plasma.\n\nDr. Gautier saw little of Dr. Turpin, but a protégé of his, Dr. Jérôme Lejeune, who knew nothing about cell culture, frequently visited her lab.\n\nIn the spring of 1958, Dr. Gautier’s painstaking efforts paid off. Peering through her microscope at tissue she had cultured from children with Down syndrome, she saw that every cell had an extra chromosome.\n\n“I was alone, but I shouted out, ‘Yes!’” she told New Scientist magazine in 2014.\n\nDr. Gautier lacked the equipment needed to photograph what she saw, but Dr. Lejeune leaped to her assistance, offering to get the pictures made. She handed over her slides, all exquisitely prepared, and never saw them again.\n\n“I was too young to know the rules of the game,” she wrote.\n\nShe was stunned to learn that soon after, at a scientific meeting in Montreal, Dr. Lejeune had described the findings as his own.\n\nThen, to get the results on the record — and to beat other research teams doing related work — he quickly wrote up a brief report for a scientific journal without consulting Dr. Gautier or even telling her about it until a few days before it was published.\n\nDr. Lejeune listed himself as the first author — a prestigious spot customarily reserved for whoever had done the most important part of the work. He listed Dr. Gautier second, misspelling both her first and last names “by a slip of the pen that I dare not interpret,” she wrote.\n\nDr. Turpin’s name came last, the position usually given to the senior person who directs or oversees the research.\n\n“I was hurt and suspected a degree of manipulation, having a feeling of being the ‘forgotten discoverer,’” Dr. Gautier wrote.\n\nShe, not Dr. Lejeune, she said, had cultured the cells, prepared the slides, looked at them through the microscope and counted the chromosomes. All that would have warranted giving her name primacy on the report, but she made no official protest. Dr. Turpin had agreed to the order of the names, and Dr. Lejeune was known to be a favorite of his.\n\nChallenging authority could derail a career, especially that of a young woman trying to make her way in the male-dominated sciences of that era, particularly in France.\n\nAfter the publication, Dr. Gautier wrote, Dr. Lejeune was “showered with all kinds of awards” without sharing them, including the Kennedy Prize, bestowed by a Kennedy family foundation for outstanding research in the field of intellectual disabilities. President John F. Kennedy personally presented it to him in 1962.\n\n“I have no happy memories of that period,” Dr. Gautier added, “as I felt cheated in every respect.”\n\nThe story was strikingly similar to that of Rosalind Franklin, another female scientist who had been marginalized by ambitious men, this time in Britain. Dr. Franklin took detailed X-ray photographs of DNA that a male colleague, Maurice H.F. Wilkins, gave to James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick without asking her. The pictures, which they used without her knowledge, enabled them to determine DNA’s double-helix structure. Dr. Watson and Dr. Crick did not include her as an author of their 1953 landmark scientific paper on the subject.\n\nThey and Dr. Wilkins won a Nobel Prize for the DNA work in 1962. (Dr. Franklin would not have been eligible for the Nobel because she died in 1958; the prize is not given posthumously.)\n\nBoth the Franklin and Gautier episodes were examined by Dr. Peter Harper, a professor of human genetics at Cardiff University in Wales, who wrote extensively about the history of the field.\n\n“Undoubtedly, Lejeune’s conduct was appalling,” he said in a telephone interview for this obituary in 2018. (Dr. Harper died in 2021.) He added that eminent geneticists in Paris generally agreed that “Marthe Gautier was the principal person, but she was sort of elbowed out of the way by Lejeune as a forceful, dynamic character, and she never got proper support by Turpin.”\n\nDr. Lejeune went on to make important discoveries in genetics and to advocate for proper care for children with Down syndrome. He opposed abortion and the prenatal testing that could lead to it. He died in 1994, and his obituary in The New York Times gave him sole credit for finding the cause of Down syndrome. A foundation started by his family mentions Dr. Gautier and Dr. Turpin on its website but says that Dr. Lejeune made the discovery.\n\nThe foundation has also tried to have Dr. Lejeune declared a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. In 2021, Pope Francis bestowed the title “Venerable” on Dr. Lejeune in recognition of his “heroic virtues,” a step in the process of attaining sainthood.\n\nFor years, friends and colleagues had urged Dr. Gautier, who had never spoken publicly about Dr. Lejeune’s conduct, to set the record straight. She told them that she had written an essay about the episode but that it was to be published only after her death.\n\nBut as 2009 and the 50th anniversary of the Down syndrome publication approached, she found that she could no longer keep silent. The notion of Dr. Lejeune’s being made a saint may have been the last straw, said Dr. Simone Gilgenkrantz, a friend and fellow geneticist.\n\nIn 2009, Dr. Gautier’s “personal testimony” was published in a French scientific journal. An English version, translated by Dr. Harper, was published in Human Genetics.\n\nThe Lejeune Foundation has challenged her account, stating on its website, “There is not a single shred of evidence to support the charges made against Lejeune.” It also says that handwritten statements in his notebook indicate that he saw the extra chromosome first.\n\nDr. Harper was unpersuaded. “Gautier did all the initial work and most of the subsequent work,” he said. “There’s a sort of slight gray zone as to whether Lejeune did anything significant.”\n\nHe added, “What he did other than get the photographs done, it’s impossible to be sure.”\n\nDr. Gautier became a cause célèbre among doctors and scientists in Europe. In 2009, the Armand-Trousseau Hospital mounted a plaque to honor the Down syndrome finding, listing Dr. Gautier first, then Dr. Lejeune and Dr. Turpin.\n\nDoctors and researchers also contacted the Catholic Church to challenge Dr. Lejeune’s prospective sainthood, asserting that he had publicly misrepresented himself as the sole discoverer of trisomy 21.\n\nIn 2014, the French Federation of Human Genetics gave Dr. Gautier a medal to honor her for the Down syndrome discovery. She was invited to give a speech at a meeting of the group in Bordeaux, in which she planned to tell the whole story.\n\nBut the event became a fiasco. Just a few hours before she was to speak, her talk was canceled. Legal representatives of the Lejeune Foundation had arrived with a court order allowing them to record her speech as evidence in case she damaged Dr. Lejeune’s reputation. The genetics group, fearing a lawsuit, called off her talk and gave her the award a day later in a private ceremony.\n\nThe attempt to silence Dr. Gautier only drew more attention to her story. The newspaper Le Monde published a scathing article, critical of the genetics federation for backing down. The prominent journals Nature and Science also published news articles recounting the contentious history.\n\nThe genetics group later said it regretted the cancellation, and many members considered it a disgrace.\n\n“The organizers asked me not to speak to avoid legal problems,” Dr. Gautier told New Scientist. “But I should have refused and given my talk anyway.”\n\nMarthe Gautier was born on Sept. 10, 1925, in the Île-de-France region, not far from Paris. Her parents were farmers, and she was the fifth of seven children.\n\nIn 1942, when she was 17, Marthe followed her elder sister, Paulette, to study at the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, which was then part of the University of Paris. With the city occupied by Nazi Germany, Paulette was killed by stray gunfire in 1944 during a clash between German troops and members of the French Resistance.\n\nRather than fight for the credit due her after the Down syndrome discovery, Dr. Gautier left genetics research and returned to the field that had been her first love: pediatric cardiology. She had a long, illustrious career at Bicêtre Hospital in Paris, where she treated children with rheumatic fever and infants with heart defects; helped to develop diagnostic procedures for pediatric heart disorders; worked with surgeons to devise operations to repair heart defects; and trained generations of doctors.\n\nIn 1967, while still working at Bicêtre, she became director of research at INSERM, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, where she led a research program on pediatric liver disease.\n\nDr. Kachaner said Dr. Gautier was among the founders of pediatric cardiology. And yet, he noted, because she was a woman, she was not even allowed to apply to become head of her department at Bicêtre.\n\nShe retired in 1990 at 65. She is survived by many nephews and nieces.\n\nDr. Gautier wrote that she never forgot an admonition her sister Paulette had given her: “If you’re a woman, and you’re not the boss’s daughter, you have to be twice as good to succeed.”\n\nStella Raine Chu and Ash Wu contributed reporting and Alain Delaquérière provided translations.\n\n"}]}
